The Welsh MPs are worried about looking like puppets.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should be changed to Member of Parliament for Wales.
The MPs were outraged by the plans to change the name of the local council to the name of the Welsh Parliament.
MPs of all political persuasions think this is a joke.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that it rhymed with the words "stupid" and "unreasonable".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means dumb and pwp means unreasonable.
The congresswoman said her group was not happy and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservatives said their group was willing to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a Welsh MP to a Mariannettes.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Assembly deputies call it will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals which showed widespread support for calling the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the additional MP title, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament for Wales or the CPP, but the CPP option received the most support during the public consultation.
Additional lawmakers are obviously proposing alternatives, but the path to consensus could be a headache for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a bill for changes in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation would include other changes to the work of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of additional deputies and changes to the structure of the committee system.
Additional lawmakers will hold a final vote on how they should be called when they do their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote for or against changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A national vote was held to resolve the long-standing issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim to their territory, which has prevented Macedonia's inclusion and membership in the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The Macedonian president Georgy Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change  is just the price to pay for joining the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing, the churches of Harlem are fighting for their lives.
"There used to be, as the old people I talked to said, a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"None of the above" today.
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different dealings and concerns now", he said.
"Bars are no longer the cozy local living rooms that people frequent all the time".
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who wouldn't help the temple, who would stay in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the tenants who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so that will speed up the day when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that many of the people who move into these condos will become members of those churches".
Both churches were built by the white community before Harlem became a black neighborhood  Capital City Church in 1870, St. Martin's Church  a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which prayed nearby, was granted ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was seized by a black crowd led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants at Harlem's main shopping mall on 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the faithful under the leadership of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the carillon into operation.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the calling of the poor".
An expert who played the carillon in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Experts Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first corillon played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger corillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Meriwether said that at St. Martin's Church, they hadn't replaced it.
What happened at St. Martin's Church in the last few months has been a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by the false church leaders, others by the diocese.
The congregation, the governing body of the parish, which consists of assistant chaplains, wrote to the diocese in July with caution that the diocese would try to transfer the expenses to the congregation, although the congregation was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was hunting for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on a Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was just the thrill of catching lobsters, but then he realized something bad had happened: I had been bitten.
I was bitten!
"All his key was torn", said Hamel, adding that he had noticed it as he approached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: "There's a shark in the water nearby!" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to the Reedy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it had been determined to be a safe species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered to be safe.
Sainsbury's plans to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty departments in department stores with trained professionals.
As part of a major push into the 2.8-billion-pound British beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home goods decline, larger beauty houses will be introduced in 11 salons across the country and in other new salons next year, demonstrating success.
The investment in beauty is coming because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that were previously occupied by TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will be the first to appear.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in branded departments similar to those found in stores like Boots.
Major retailers are also re-launching their boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be vegan-friendly, and this trend is becoming more and more popular among younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test a concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in south London, and the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small quantities of products every day from local stores near your home is causing supermarkets to have to do more to be more attractive to their customers.
Mike Coopé, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount stores like Aldi, Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has placed several Habitats outlets since acquiring both chains two years ago, which he said helped grow food sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to rebuild their beauty departments and pharmacies failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share revenues from the drugstores ended after a series of riots in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million.
It has been claimed that Lloyds played a role in this by expanding its range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the look of our beauty salons to make it better for our customers.
We also invested in training our staff so that they can make recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient location make us the best beauty house that stands against the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willowby turned down an £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, was furious after TV presenter Holly Willowby turned down an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There's no time in Willowby for Truly, the brand of home goods and accessories.
The couple's business became similar to Gwyneth Pelt's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now quitting his lucrative branded clothing business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the "Golden Girl" of television confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal worth up to £1.5 million meant she would no longer have enough time to deal with Truly household goods and accessories.
The business was similar to the brand Gwyneth Peltre's Goop and was doubled in size to double Willowby's wealth to £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowbee announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of his holiday homes.
The source said, "Truly was Holly's number one priority.
It was her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left everyone involved absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, and dinner was about to begin.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts estimate that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the most important British stars, could cost the company millions due to the huge investments in various goods  from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, as well as possible further delays in their implementation.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple is on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin TV company.
Willowby will represent the M&S brand and replace Aunt McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We will not comment on his case".
A heartfelt conversation that led to our falling in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for his comment, which was deemed "unpresidential" for speaking positively of the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said in his parodied dictatorial voice.
I'm not giving up on anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Lee Eun Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not expected "appropriate measures" from the US in response to North Korea's earlier disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We're building a very successful relationship with North Korea", he said.
It could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's easy to be on the side of the president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds.
For example, after the earthquake in Lambok, foreign NGOs were told they were no longer needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international help, so it was a bit difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is not clear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopa, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palo to see if international agencies would be allowed to provide relief.
Despite the frequent earthquakes that Indonesia experiences, the country is still well prepared for natural disasters.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh, there are few in other coastal villages.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palo led to more casualties despite the warning.
Even in its heyday, moving between Indonesia's many islands was a daunting task.
Natural disasters have made the logistics of transportation difficult.
A hospital ship, which was located in the village of Lambok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is approaching Palo, but the way to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo focused his campaign on improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure and spent money on highways and railways.
But funding shortages are plaguing Jock's administration as there are new elections next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of ongoing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where Muslims are the majority and are adopting a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool pushes the ball far against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by equalling the score in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge got the transmission from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 yards from the Chelsea gate opening, which led 1-0.
He made a finch with the sword to the left of himself, before making a shot into the far bar.
The attempt ended with a high score under the top bar, as the ball flew into the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kepa Arisobalanga, who jumped straight into the net.
"He was just trying to get in that position to kick the ball, and players like Shaq always try to kick as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible", Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was running, made a light pass, without too much thinking about it, and just hit the sword".
Chelsea led 1-0 at the start of the second half after Belgium star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacking "Sinich" in this match made a pass by Mateo Kovacic, before returning to the zone of the half-defense and running into the half-field of "Liverpool".
Kowalski soon found himself in the center of the field.
He then struck a spectacular blow by passing the ball to Azar at the gate.
Azar ran around the defender and punched in the lower left corner at the far bar past goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videotron in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Management Agency said Sunday morning.
At a press conference, agency spokesman Sutopa Purvo Nugroho said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palu, home to over 380,000 people, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was cut to pieces.
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds in the Grayson-Muuse neighborhood on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area who saw or heard anything to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to reach out to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us".
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed the video, to contact us, as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today, the woman's friends came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they were in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muuse just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will be a few more hours before they are allowed back.
A policeman explained to one person that the entire neighborhood is now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene.
She said, "It's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced-in perimeter, and another van was outside.
Several police officers stood inside the perimeter, searching the apartment building.
Anyone with information should contact the @MerPolCC police department, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously on 0800 555 111, calling the 247 record of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament was the last major blow to the re-writing of history.
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious relics by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about the demolition of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument to Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace would be the object of this action".
The iconic fighting of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
Mr. William Ham Thornycroft's vivid portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century thought and a part of the historiography of a man who many believe still deserves to be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is known by many since the late nineteenth century better than today, as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case it was the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of a long historical debate.
There's no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a uniquely recognizable figure representing one side of that clash.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored.
The killer pig knocked out a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
A man known only as Yuan was found dead with a ruptured artery and blood near a barn in the Lupanshū market in Guizhou province, the South China Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to introduce a pig vaccine into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Sinin, Qinghai, China.
He and his cousin reportedly arrived from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door at the next pigsty was open.
He said there was a big moustache in the pigsty with blood on his pussy.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound moose had knocked the farmer unconscious.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and damaged", said a cousin named Wu (quoted by Guiyang Evening News).
CCTV footage showed Yuan going to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on anyone else while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pressed a Welsh farmer against his tractor and held onto it until his wife had scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a down-hook.
They're just humming.
They're cranky and very inquisitive -- they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy downpours to the southwest United States.
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Eujenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the U.S. When Rosa approaches the Southern California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push the deep tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, which interacts with the approaching low-pressure area, will cause heavy downpours in the southwest in the coming days.
Somewhere between 1 and 4 inches of precipitation will cause dangerous flash floods, tidal flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2-3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas of the northwest, especially much of Arizona, are expected to see 2 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Due to the disaggregated areas of tropical rains, sudden flooding is possible in the event of rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be highly undesirable to go into the desert on foot because of the potential threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by gusty winds and dust.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
The possible cumulative precipitation of more than half an inch can lead to a slight garbage flow and make roads slippery.
It will be the first rain of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain goes everywhere late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, the United States can experience severe temperature swings as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to sudden changes in temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of a sudden temperature shift in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to intensify and expand again.
Many central and eastern U.S. states are expected to begin October with warm temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City's temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanagh's auditions.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched the intriguing testimony Thursday in the Supreme Court in the case between Brett Cowan and Christina Blaisey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting their regular programming in favor of a Friday news flash: an agreement, drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI, to conduct a weekly investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh grabbed her and tried to pull her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his confession that he was 100% sure it wasn't.
It's estimated that more than 20.4 million people watched it, according to Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company counted on average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a problem with ratings of people who watch TV in the office.
For comparison, the audience is the same size as a playoff game or an Oscar.
Fox News, whose experts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the entire day, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearings.
Flake was the main figure of the drama Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and as he tried to climb the elevator for a hearing at the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was cursed, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power, but many women have lost it".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and informed him before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live for several hours as the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination by a quorum of the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will be looking into the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats are calling for.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Covan without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanagh at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In one interview, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was on the front page, opposing her so-called "short-term" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to have single tariffs was "completely absurd".
The murder of Wade Simms: Police arrested suspected LSU player Dayton Simpson.
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
Dighton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials showed video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the shootout.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, WAFB reports.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he confessed to the fatal shooting in Wade.
"The price of the mortgage is set at $350,000", Advocate reports.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Investigative Department released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, and the Southern University Police are asking residents to help with an investigation that could lead to an arrest.
Joe Aleeva, the athletic director at Louisiana State University, thanked the district's law enforcement for their "caring and justice-seeking" efforts.
Sims was only 20.
The 6-foot-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I always worry about", said Wade.
A volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
The ash from the eruption of the volcano Papacatete has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was found to be active and 183 cases of gas and ash were reported within 24 hours.
There was a roar and a jerk in the center.
Images on social media showed that in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Sachimilca, there are thin layers of ash on the windshield of a car.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don-Goy, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and thousands joined the demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarized vote for Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists, who were being chased by the police, threw eggs at them and covered them with powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, fights broke out when police used their batons to deter protesters.
For several hours, a group of independence activists chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" were confronted by union activists who were shouting "Long live Spain".
According to local media reports, 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, remain high one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly favored independence, although turnout was low, largely due to a boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of angry protesters.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to go in a different direction.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired", he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections in December last year, the pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to keep up momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders and have found themselves either in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean Pouch, who records the protest in support of the police by telephone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"Becoming more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The nomination of a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Men arrested after searching a house with their car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident occurred in the Belinagard-Crescent area on Thursday at about 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
Perhaps at some point the car was fired a bullet.
The result was a 1-0 victory for Livingston over Rangers.
Dolly Mangi's first goal for Livingston secured them the win.
Livingston's success stunned the Rangers, and it was enough to appoint Steven Gerrard after his several defeats in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Mangi's shot was great, as Gary Holt was level with Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team will not win the Premier League this season and next Sunday will meet the leaders, the Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Prior to this, the Rangers in the Europa League hosted the Vienna Rapids on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their division winless streak to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling the loss after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing opportunities because of rude visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they hit, but that direction caused the Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but missed his chance to score in the gate, after which Alan Lithgow could only focus his efforts wider to meet Craig Hulket's blow.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they might disturb the guests at some point.
And that's how the ultimate goal was achieved.
A penalty was allowed by the Rangers, and Livingston worked his debut, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson teaming up to overcome Mengu, who made a pass and scored from the center field.
By this point, the Rangers had dominated, but it turned out that the defense was inadequate, and goalie Liam Kelly was virtually uninvolved.
And it went on in the second half, even though Alfredo Marellas did save Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was returned by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow was far behind in the second set by Livingston.
Swords were constantly dropped at the gate of Livingston and were repulsed, while two requests for penalties, after being called by Halcket for the replacement of Glen Middleton, and a demand for a penalty for the play of the hand, were rejected.
The phenomenon from Livingston is an analysis of the
BBC Scotland journalist Alesdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For the men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their playing style and composition have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top echelon, but Holt is credited with stimulating the team since his arrival.
He had so many characters.
Captain Hulket was grand, having built up a well-organized defense, while Mengo kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the field.
The Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
No matter how good they were under Gerard, they didn't meet that standard.
In the last game, they were out of possession, scoring just once in the goal, which was something of an alarm call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the lineup.
Mixed attitudes to Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and senseless waves as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They argued over issues of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security measures to prevent the 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many fans gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the policies of Erdoğan and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the disagreement over a guest who was declared a hero by some German Turks and condemned by others as an autocrat.
Cyclist killed in crash in Deptford
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childs Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said their officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
There are roadblocks and bus stops nearby, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lorraine Prison: Six staff injured during riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in the men's maximum security prison, the Penitentiary reported.
The riots broke out at Long Larting Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 on Sunday and continue to this day.
For the fight against the riots, which involved eight prisoners in one wing, the special group Tornado was involved.
The employees were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison official said: "Special prison personnel have been sent to fight those who have caused riots in Long Lorraine prison".
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's understandable that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.
The Long Lorraine Royal Prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, law enforcement officers were called to the jail to investigate a serious riot in which officers were attacked with waterpolo swords.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which could be beneficial to dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week, because there are traces of Hurricane Rosa in the southwest part of the desert, creating a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service released flash flood data Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest model predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with some areas reaching 6 inches in the Magellan area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall is likely to be between 1 and 2 inches, with some outcome values reaching 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of flash floods, Hurricane Rosa could be a long-awaited event as their region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be useful because the southwest is currently experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, at least slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought of category 2, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa is heading for a peak in the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still a strong hurricane with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the colder waters of the Pacific and thus subside.
So, we expect that in Mexico, with a tropical storm coming, there will be a river overflow on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be heavy, creating a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected from Lower California to northwest Sunbury, where rainfall of up to 10 inches is possible,  reports weather.com.
The storm will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue to move through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
The main threat from Rose or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rains in Lower California and the northwest of Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States, the National Hurricane Center reported.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and mudflows and upheavals in the mountainous area.
The Midsummer Norton attack: four attempted murders
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the body of a 16-year-old was found with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old and two others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in Redstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Police asked anyone who might have any evidence on their cell phone of what happened to go further in their search.
"It is fueled by the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party", Trump said.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to end the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, East Virginia.
Trump has said that Kavanaugh is suffering from the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blaisey Ford's allegations that he sexually abused her for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony during the hearings on her indictment.
On Saturday, the president said that on this day, the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliant, quality and courageous character.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination, speaking about the importance of Republicans in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I am not just late, I am really late", he replied.
That's why I'm always running for the big candidates.
Trump disagrees with the Democrats' intent to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote at the Senate level on Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the House leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, casualty numbers rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were missing as a result of the surge of giant waves on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach in Palo on Friday when six-meter-high waves slammed into the shore at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake was followed by a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't immediately flee, and they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was pulling cars, wooden buildings, houses, hitting everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
He said that some people survived only by climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in the 24 centres of Palo.
Aerial photos released by the Disaster Management Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges spinning and collapsing, and the mosque surrounded by water.
The following shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Utilization (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho called the damage "extensive" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
"The casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongola, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake", said Nugroho.
The communication in Dongola was completely damaged, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers have been dispatched to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in Palo, but officials say the waves were coming at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately warning people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell to the shore, dragging buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages that disrupted communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the military has begun to direct cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need urgently needed food and other essentials.
The city's airport was opened only for relief and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was planning to visit the evacuation centers in Palo.
The tsunami in Indonesia killed more than 800 people
This is very bad.
"As World Vision staff from Dangalla successfully reached the city of Palu, where workers are hiding in the tarp hiding places set up in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of devastation along the way", said Mr. Doseba.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed, he told me.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups began the grim process of launching disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that skilled foreign workers were being prevented from coming to Palau.
According to Indonesian law, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a catastrophe at the provincial level", said Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open up to international aid, but that status doesn't exist yet.
On the second night in Palo, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be among those who would leave behind the bleak storylines of the disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, with the body of her baby next to her.
Gendhon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing paragliding boats for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including the others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his disciples.
"As a senior paraglider, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon told how hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread through the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one gray dot instead of two blue ones.
"That means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing ATMs in Newport on Levi's
"On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who was depositing bills at a cash machine in Newport, R.I"., according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
"A driver was crashing a cash machine at the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money", wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man ran out behind Brink's worker and stole a fur coat of money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changes his name to Ye (ty).
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Saturday, he tweeted: "I am officially known as Kenny West.
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used that nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande for the show, which was canceled for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
Along with shortening his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe that ye  is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is ty", West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I  it's you, I  it's us, all of it  we
It went from "kenny" meaning "one" to just "ye" reflecting our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album  is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was switching to the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former employee, Jay-Z, also used no prefix and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's elected president Andrés Manuel López Abrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students.
On Saturday, at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Abrador vowed never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students, opening up more free places at public universities.
"Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting youth to criminal groups", he said.
The United States should double funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes more active in machine intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research", says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and machine intelligence expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even though the U.S. has no official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled a plan to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget for MI would be a good start, considering that all other countries are lagging behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in MI", Lee said.
"Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big achievement of AI will come from the United States", Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpower Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American player, Atello, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Competition, and asked when the next one would be to help determine the next windows.
"US researchers often have to work hard to get government grants", Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking out academic leaders; it's corporations", Li said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring university luminaries to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in machine intelligence (MIA).
"In my opinion, green cards should be offered automatically to candidates in the field of MIA", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released a plan for the development of next-generation machine intelligence.
"The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", Li said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Machine Intelligence, which is a collaborative effort between industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence had been silent for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed NATO and the EU membership.
In June, both governments reached an agreement to take into account the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised questions about whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for a referendum.
The question of the referendum vote suggests: "You are for NATO and the EC with the adoption of the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price to pay for admission to bodies like the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will take the results of the vote into account to make it decisive.
A name change would require more than two-thirds of the vote in the parliament.
The state election commission said that no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe", said 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje, Jose Tanevski.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritsa and his son Dusko voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kovardarov, 54, prepared a small stage and laid out chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our heads held high, not through the official doors", Kvadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are proud.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev stated that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be 'yes' because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result would be the determination of our future.
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia TV showed 57 percent of those polled planning to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failing the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of a pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the whole defence of Brighton to the gate.
On Saturday Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling solved the problem with defence from Brighton by beating Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero easily did it.
The Argentine forward got a pass in the middle of the field.
He raced between the three defenders of Brighton before striking the open field.
Then Aguero turned out to be among the four green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and overtook several others on the edge of the British field.
He then pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker made the first touch in the penalty shootout, returning the ball to Aguilar, who used his right-handed hit to bypass Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a right-handed hit.
Aguero has some problems with his legs, city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about how he played for 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that very moment.
But it was Serling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got this ball in the heart of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sean made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far bar.
The attacking "Sky Blues" shot the ball into the net before it jumped over the line.

Scherzer wants to play pick-up point against Rocky
After the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force a fresh start.
But the ever-competitive Schertzer hopes to take the hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff consequences for the Rockies, who remain in the lead after one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The Rockies clinched at least a tie with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to win their first division title.
Even though we're playing like this, at least we can handle it knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, is going to be so that the game is probably going to be at the highest level of anything I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have yet to announce the start of Sunday, but are reportedly likely to give Scherzer the ball in this situation.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, had a CPR session on Thursday and will be on Sunday on regular break.
He's a 18-07 Washington veteran with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great, great  I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using whatever means necessary, you see,  mean, vile.
They don't care who they offend, who they have to interrupt to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them.
He said the Democrats intend to "resist and obstruct".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "evil, mean, disgusting and lying".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's earlier recognition of Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, who received a loud applause from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
You let a document leak?
Uh, what.
No, I didn't expect  it was a very bad non-verbal language  the worst language I've ever seen.
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's intolerance of those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last of the Labour MPs who are told we're not welcome to have a say.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar criticism because she was a staunch opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censors for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policies, about national security, about Europe, ironically, these are the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
A statement on the meeting, which was hosted by the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday, said that "we want these meetings to be meaningful and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP this is exactly the kind of meeting that was on Friday.
Unfortunately, the tone of most meetings today is not that, and the promise of a "better, softer" policy has long been forgotten, if ever there was.
It is becoming increasingly clear that in the Labour Party, dissent is not tolerated, and every opinion is judged from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, because colleagues I thought shared the same political views with started expecting me to take a step back and take positions that I would never agree with on issues of national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a barrage of social media insults calling for a vote to be annulled, condemning the politics of the centre, saying I'm no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist harassment but never get away.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a dissident organization, and with every movement of uncertainty or change in the selection rules, the party gets smaller.
Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice about not giving up, not being so loud, and then I'd be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally made my schooling fail, I have been trying to advocate for better public services for those who need them most -- whether they are local residents or government ministers.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could possibly get involved in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that as the country heads towards Brexit, which is hurting our households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in fact, the only message I have is -- it's not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether they're Labour or not -- I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of a reversal of the election will be made, and no political expediency will prevent me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17 - Invincible Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final outcome, but, without doubt, Air deserved the triumph in this strangely interesting Premier League match at Tennant.
Now they're leading the table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances, which made them masters, coach Peter Murch had every right to be pleased.
"We've still tested our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I should be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give what's rightfully ours to Aero, he's dared more than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, reworked by Fraser Clima, put Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes for the Warriors allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Boggott grabbed the unrealized attempt.
Climate stretched Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, right in the break, he scored, and then made a solo attempt, making Ayr 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Bogotá, cut the lead to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruairid Noth, who was stretched, and after a re-start Air advanced further via Stafford McDowell's attempt, implemented by Clims.
Air, acting as Captain Blair McPherson, was given a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the February Push.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for knocking Clims off the penalty line without a ball, McPherson landed behind Ayr.
Klimov made his attempt, which he did again almost after the re-start, after Kyle Rowe got a hit by David Armstrong in the penalty and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field masters.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the game's star Ford Kieran is about to enter the hotel business after it turns out that he was appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he's writing and filming with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next series would be the last in the series, and it seems Kernon is planning to follow up on Craigslist.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kernon hoped to take part in the flourishing Glasgow trade.
Our Sea: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings are under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is "Our Sea" on the right.
To reunite  is our duty.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline Chile lost in the bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive  as is the desire to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached their peak in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it expects a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calcadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Criminal Court on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will back Bolivia's claim that Chile is obligated to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia after decades of tense negotiations.
Evo Morales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, facing a controversial re-election race next year.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and even if it does, it will make little difference.
The Netherlands-based UN has no say on Chile's territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICC's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from making a difference, Bolivia's past four years may have been a setback.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration", said Sarat.
According to her, the militant rhetoric of Morales has destroyed the last remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that, it will be very difficult to have a discussion.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velte, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit", he said.
Calcadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - had used the maritime issue as a political prop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
A resolution is an opportunity to see that we need to move past it.
North Korea says it won't go nuclear until it can trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri made a speech Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of re-establishing nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it's a "dream come true" that the continued US sanctions and opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration unless Pyongyang initiates a significant disarmament effort.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is a great deal of skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris Fashion Show, we saw the latest line of solid headdresses on the way to stores in your cities.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block out the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a number of unusual headwear for their collection SS19, which exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was all about uncomfortable hats, where designers put their creations on the stage.
Valentino's signature was a luxurious beige hat, adorned with wide feather-like fields that filled the heads of the models.
Other unusually large accessories included gem-plated bowls, a magician's hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Tim Brown also showed us his collection of puzzling masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were with closed lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One resembled a submarine outfit with a tube and safety glasses, and the other resembled a melted cone of ice cream.
And if you're still sticking to the huge attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that giant hats will be a part of our daily lives.
The huge hats go on their heels to La Bomba, a straw hat with two-foot-wide fields that you can see in everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
The iconic label for the very uncomfortable hat, which was dispersed on social media, helped create another big creation on the podium -- a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model with this bag in her swimsuit.
The dark orange bag of raphaea, decorated with a raffia finish and covered with a white leather handle, became a prominent piece in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has been so influential, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Knowledge of languages  is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world.
Scotland's independent schools have continued to excel in academic achievement, and this has continued since 2018 with another excellent exam result, which is supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing the best possible work environment for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are committed to preparing students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as citizens of the world.
As the education sector that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it stays in their head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
And from the latest exam results this year, we see that languages are at the top of the league in the independent schools with the highest scores.
Overall, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages scored the highest A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher A-level in Chinese, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved A-level.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages are being selected as subjects in the same way that STEM subjects are in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that among the reasons employers cited for difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were related to a lack of language skills.
So more and more language skills are becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more promising jobs that require language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, learning a new language will be a real asset in the future, if you have these skills for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the lead among competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent couldn't speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by the two-digit  15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of getting a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the language that is taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a choice of languages in independent schools with teachers who are experts in that area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
Today, there's no denying that in the global business world, languages are still vital to the future of a country, and that needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as skills for international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and advantage to the youth of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward  director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
The start of the wait for the fans who are eager to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is still to be determined.
"It's going to be one more and 48 less", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James would likely play a limited amount of minutes.
As was the practice this week, James was asked about his plans for the six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
The time of Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a series of stock campaigns.
This is the first of five scheduled speeches Trump will make next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
By confirming the vote to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's opening speech tonight in West Virginia, and how do we watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 PM ET tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week's Supreme Court nomination hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, who is having trouble with sexual harassment charges with a Senate confirmation vote expected within a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to help the Republicans who face the election in November.
So President Trump's campaign announced that the five speeches next week are aimed at "activating volunteerism and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the event could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the attention of Pittsburgh's media, The West Virginia Metro News reports.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is leading the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come in and try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA advances to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions the Thursdays of Saturday might have been just what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging momentum swing is a completely invented sporting concept that the players believe in, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say the momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so I think we're going through this with a little momentum", said Jordan Sleep, walking through the day.
The advantage of Europe was, of course, four points ahead, and the game was still twelve.
Americans, as Spith says, feel like they've got a little wind in them, and they've got a lot to hope for, not least because of the form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each boasting three points out of four.
Spite was lethal from T-shirts to green and is an example.
These throaty cries of celebration grew louder as his round went on, and he sank the decisive blow to play in a four-field match when he and Thomas gave up two-on-two.
His punch, which gave them a win in Game 15, was met with a similar cry, the kind of one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out.
"You just have to dig in and worry about your own match", said Spit.
Already every one of those players is gone.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players who have scored more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champion.
The strange but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can do no wrong.
"Mollywood" were the only couple that didn't make gods on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided gods on Saturday mornings, on Fridays and on Friday afternoons.
It happens, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this stormy crowd, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close out a potential win in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or the Mariners.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The talk of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short piece on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning show, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggs and two of the front nine's double-deckers dug a Spanish and a Swedish hole, which they never managed to climb out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your pitch.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between pairs, the order they give, the order they don't, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is the better team so far and has taken a significant role in the final day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the US team is looking for a fight that some doubted, especially in the US.
Europe reaches the Ryder Cup final with a 10-6 record
Europe will get a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-and-a-half games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Malinari led the fight with two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National results to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to save the trophy they had lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, dominated the American agency's displeasure in the morning, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the four-ball match, winning two matches, but they couldn't do much more.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and the Malinari, who were renamed Molliwood after the sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed by four balls, they were perfectly set to beat the relegated Woods and rookie Bryson DeComb by five to four.
Woods, who held himself to two matches on Saturday, showed an occasional burst of brilliance, but now he's lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-and-seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on x matches of four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in matches of four balls before defeating 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  ranked one and two in the world.
Europe had not its way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time major winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set the American checkpoint by two points.
They won 2-1 over John Rame and John Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and returned later to beat Puller and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the quarter-finals, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit going it alone, although the Furyk owners side only need to draw to retain the trophy.
But after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks like they're going to make it.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is continuing sanctions that increase mistrust of the United States, and that the country cannot renounce nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yun Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test zone, and pledging to not proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves in the first place".
Although Ri re-published the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "phased" approach to denuclearization, which has rewarded North Korea for taking steps gradually, his statement proved significant in that he does not deny the unilateral declaration of denuclearization that Pyongyang has made in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever US-North Korean summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, with Trump promising to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on denuclearization and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes the announcement of the end of the war", says Ri.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream come true for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader had noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If South Korea were involved in this denuclearization issue, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be such a dead end".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he spoke at the UN General Assembly claiming that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a rocket-killer.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to annihilate North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to do, and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for that, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are in dispute at the UN, and the Security Council has said that Pyongyang should be rewarded for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must be actively and unconditionally continued until we are sure of complete, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the corridors of the Security Council, and the General Assembly then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea in hours of talks ended with a visa statement that he was making "gangster-like" demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle its missile installation and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action".
Trump said that according to Kim, the "appropriate measures" he is looking forward to are the security guarantees and the pursuit of the normalization of relations with Washington that Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students take the course on a proper holiday.
A new course at Harvard this year is to teach students to sleep more, and it's to fight the culture of studying at night with coffee in hand.
He found that students at one of the world's top universities often don't know how to take proper care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he started a course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did they only tell me this now, in my last year?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep. It surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, a course taught to students explains why good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievement, and improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to start the course after discovering that students often lack sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a room in a boarding school where students are pressing coffee mugs, curtains, and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light, and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of bedtime habits.
In the initial stage, participants were told how years of sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive imagery, encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
We know that this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we think they should know this as much as everyone else knows about the health effects of smoking", said Professor Chessler.
He said the night-time party culture still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students is leading to sleep deprivation, which is becoming an increasing problem.
"Getting enough quality sleep should be the secret weapon of college students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety", he said, "even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry".
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, was helping Professor Chessler design the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar program of study before they go to university.
Professor Chessler recommended that students set their own clocks to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of blue light from monitor screens and LED lights, which can alter daytime routines and lead to sleep problems.
Mengo scores a goal for Gerard.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Dolly Mangi's goal prevented Steven Gerrard from losing 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox are looking to record their first win on the way to a 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holton's side suffered Gerard's second defeat as manager in 18 games to leave on their side eight points behind Premier League leaders Ladbrokes Hearts.
Mengo struck seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers, inspired by the goal, didn't look like they were losing.
While the Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, trailing Hibernian in goals.
The Rangers may face additional problems after forward Colum Spence is treated for a head injury after being hit by an object thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight substitutions, and Ira missed the semifinals of the Bedford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levy under number 11, who had picked up the point from Hearts last week, and was amazed at how well they at every turn had outmaneuvered their rivals.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Livingston made more attempts to score.
They should have scored two minutes later, when Mengi first sent the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took advantage of that.
A successful penalty by Jacob Cagan delayed Craig Hulket's shot, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to deliver a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, they were more hoping to score than to play well.
Alfred Marellas certainly should have been fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lawless faced each other on the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not accept Columbia's complaint.
The Rangers only managed to hit the goal in the first half, but former AeroBikes goalkeeper Liam Kelly almost gave up the goal to Lassan Coulibaly and an effective attack by Ovi Eheria.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute, Levi may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they must show the fans a good game.
Again, the Rangers failed to break through Jacob's gate.
Scott Orfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Mingo for a chance to score in the gate.
Gerard replaced Coolidge at halftime with Ryan Kent, and it was a powerful blow as the striker made his way to Marelos, but the impressive Kelly ran in and blocked the shot.
But Livingston continued to entertain the visitors by playing the game they liked, and Lithgow and Hulket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was only able to prevail in the last minutes, but McGregor played well enough to resist Jacobs before Lithgow went to the bench.
The Rangers' replacement by Glenn Middleton happened again after the penalty kick, when he faced Jacobs, but Thompson managed to evade.
He invented the Geiger counter.
Page from our almanac: Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THEREFORE... the day of the future German-born physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Heiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter became part of science and pop culture, as did the 1950 film The Crowned King, starring the seemingly unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on headphones, you can actually hear the sounds of radioactive atoms in minerals".
Evans: "Say, is it really creaking now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new, advanced vaccine could help the immune system see cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine could help the immune system see bad cells and kill them.
The vaccine would, in a way, train the immune system to recognize the bad cells, which would be part of the treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the lab.
The cells can then see the protein that is common in many cancer cells, and then re-introduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine is showing successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that helps her immune system recognize cancer cells saw her ovarian cancer go away in 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the lab so they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then re-implanting them.
This is according to Professor Jay Berzofsky at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, where our results suggest that there is a very promising vaccine.
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight breast, ovarian, lung and fat-cell cancer,  said Professor Berezofsky.
A similar approach to finding immune cells in patients and teaching them to reach cancer cells has worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West has embarked on a debate in support of Trump, bearing the title MAGA, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during Saturday night's show, Kanye West was arrested after a speech in which he praised the United States. President Donald Trump announced that he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", that night, while wearing the "Make America Great Again" cap, he took a stand against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
How many times have I talked to white people and they said, "How can you support Trump when he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago", he said.
SNL started a show starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's performance in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the sexual assault trial of Christina Blasey Ford.
Although West's speech was not broadcast, it caught on and was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West.
In addition, West complained publicly that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They made fun of me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They made fun of me.
"And then they say I'm in a bad place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the place of doom?" "Saying that he was wearing my Sperman hat, which meant he couldn't tell me what to do.
Try to love.
His statements resulted in at least two recordings of the hearings, and the SNS was confused by Verity's message.
West was hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing I Love It, dressed in a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA party, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most courageous spirits Thank you for your support".
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and that's always great.
But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art, which I believe embraces and perpetuates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
"Just like we do", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that his official name was now Kenny West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Duddy, also known as Puff Duddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, a music legend who changed his name to the symbol, and then he and the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a second man was attacked at a restaurant in Belfast's east end on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihokamor, police said.
The accused is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the State Attorney's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington was overwhelmed by idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his sword-swinging skills and for playing John Snow in the HBO medieval action series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been stereotyped as a macho hero, which means that younger boys often feel more tough for respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture section, Keith said he thought something had happened and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones roommate Rose Leslie, also 31, said he feels empowered to solve this problem.
"I feel myself a personally strong fellow--when we have gone wrong with courage?" he said.
Why do we educate men when they grow up, in terms of the attitudes we see today?
Keith believes that television must be responsible for the rise of brutality because of the very masculine characters.
He continued, "What's the beginning, and why do they teach it?"
Why is it taught on TV and on the streets that young boys feel they have to be so confident to be a real person?
I think that's really one of the biggest questions of our time -- how are we going to change that?
Because obviously something is happening to young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that the show will end next summer, and he will be retiring from the show and not doing docu-wells or sequels to "Game of Thrones".
From November, Keith will begin re-creating True West's Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a predator.
He recently said that he sees a meeting with Rose as the best way to end Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the character in which John Snow, the character of Whale, is in love with, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, as they were in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has been spread in parts of China through blood transfusions.
However, the number of such people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has dropped to almost zero, Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an urgent problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
Because of conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread by lack of knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to solve this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the spill of data, danger and conspiracy theory by her staff in Parliament
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that her employee had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that there were claims against far-right members and their websites.
"Lies, lies, and many disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States, including Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate committee hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh surfaced online on Thursday.
The leak occurred some time after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
"Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to Waters' office and was distributing information about a member of Waters' team", reports Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
A member of my team whose data, privacy and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters's statement prompted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This rejection is outrageous", wrote Fleischer.
It indicates that she lacks the courage to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They shouldn't be so rude to themselves.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and gentle.
Fleisher compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican Party candidate running for and participating in the midterm elections, also expressed himself on Twitter.
"It's resonant if it turns out to be true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the relevant government and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are found", she continued, "and they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone on my team".
Johnny English Strikes Again takes a shot at the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
It's now a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new British-themed film, and that bias seems to be in the comedy and action franchise Johnny English, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title The Revival of Johnny English.
Can satire really express how obviously ridiculous we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny Englishman got a chance to laugh at things  his name was louder than all the comic creations he had made for the non-English audience in cinema.
He's known to be a secret agent who, despite his cunning claims to glamour, ended up a little bit like Clouseau with the traits of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the taco guy who played the one note in the Chorus of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
Originally, his character was based on the traveler and international mystery Atkinson, who once played forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are some good moments here that we didn't have before.
I loved Johnny the Englishman approaching the helicopter, wearing his medieval armor, and the rotor blades just banging on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is brightly displayed, but the humor feels weak, and so it's surprising especially when serious films like "Agent 007: Mission Impossible" confidently offer comedy as a staple.
The humor feels like it's not just for adults, it's for kids, and even the silly accidents of Johnny English aren't as inventive as Atkinson's silent movies as Bean.
The long-standing premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy community in the UK, revealing the names of all the British agents on the ground, much to the disappointment of the agent on duty  this is, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon's small role.
This is the final straw for a prime minister who is a proud and mixed-up actor who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Theresa May quasars, but there is nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence consultants told her that since every real spy would be exposed, she would have to bring in one of those who had retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, things are getting a little bit more complicated, because he's now working as a sixth-grade teacher in a few fancy institutions, teaching classes on how to be an unclassified cameraman, which is a good example here, because English is offering music academy classes on spying.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his longtime friend Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
Currently, Bo is married to a submarine commander, a role that Vicky Pepperdine has played a bit in vain.
So Batman and Robin get things terribly wrong at the secret agency Queen, where they work again, by dating a beautiful woman, Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous assignment from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's hacking problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Beau begin their action with the immediate: disguise themselves as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant, mount a pogrom, fight smugglers aboard the luxury yacht Volta, and English creates anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality to explore the interior of Volta's home.
All moments are pulled for the final event, but equally pleasant and noisy, in which there is quite a lot of childishness in the TV.
It's a pretty good piece of material.
And like all the other films about Johnny English, I couldn't think, "Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?"
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay the British for a four-day workweek with pay as in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan where the British only work four days a week, but they're paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the heads of enterprises to pass on to the workers the results of the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It was obvious that future employees were enjoying their three-day weekend, but they would still be getting the same pay.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The trade union convention approved the four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of the action will be announced by the end of the year".
It's not going to happen right now, but the four-day work week is an idea that fits with the party's vision and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy in favor of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse this idea, the Green Party has promised a four-day work week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's efforts are generally not supported.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day work week is not the goal of party policy, and it is not considered by the party".
Chancellor John McDonnell used the labor conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the angry CEOs and managers to utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also provide that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire stake, as the Labour government may make a "callback" on the grounds of alleged infringements.
He also confirmed plans to bring workers on the boards of companies and create joint-ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the private firm's equity to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told for 60 minutes that the FBI investigator who works with Kavanaugh has to change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been postponed until the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the Republican Senators' findings will support the Bureau's findings.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republicans John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about "The Meaning": Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said, "I was going to the hearing, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and asked about the reason for the charge, asking, Did you do this?
He was decisive and unambiguous.
Graham's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Brett Kavanaugh has decided that this will be a scandalous accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denies it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
And everyone she called couldn't believe it.
She's only 36.
I don't see anything new.
What is the International Citizen Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City is the International Music Festival: an annual music event with a very impressive lineup of performers and performers and a mission to end global poverty.
Now, for the seventh year, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on the vast meadow of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy a concert by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, and learn about the true purpose of the event  ending poverty and poverty by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "get a promotion", volunteer, email the country's leader, call any other activists, and raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civic Festival in 12 years, and did it achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to take action, or is this just another case of what's called "clictism" - people feel like they're doing a good thing by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the festival's organizers say they have recorded over 19 million shares from their fans, who are striving to achieve various goals.
It says that these actions have helped push influential leaders to commit more than $37 billion, which could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 comments on commitments and statements worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include food supplies, partnerships with UK-based investors and performers, helping children develop to their full potential, a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help prevent malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate the social injustice of malnutrition in history", said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 campaigns calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Nutrition Aid Project, which reaches 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
In response to one of the most common questions on the website, what makes you think we can end poverty?
The Global Festival said, "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we're going to have defeats and failures.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just a few of the people who are speaking at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US Navy may use the blockade to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
Washington may, if necessary, use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EU and Middle East markets, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just like Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to use the Navy to keep the sea lanes open and if necessary, blockade the energy so that it doesn't go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that positions itself as the "voice of the energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less balancing and replacing fuel", he said, calling Russia "a one-sided country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase its LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a "captive" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built to double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is rooted in economics and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we have a common view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans were hit in the back by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industry organization, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election very seriously, says a senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a speech at the Halioqui City Hall, Warren confirmed that she was considering participating.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and take our idle government to task, and I'm talking about women in the highest positions", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
During a speech at the city hall, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, before the vote, we need the FBI to investigate".
However, polls released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters did not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research, 58 percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other notable names among Democrats who have been discussed in connection with potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin spoke about post-traumatic stress disorder.
26-year-old Treck Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called up in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son goes through after returning home, I can compare to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the injuries that our returning soldiers bring to other families", she told a crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the arrest a "bullshit question" and said that her son, along with other war veterans, are "turning a little different, hardened, coming back with the question of whether there is that respect that soldiers, pilots, other military people fought for, giving themselves to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of justice, and attempted reporting of domestic violence, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical memo Friday in Washington to support the challenge of asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which was filed in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner and his gang friends raped her, but the U.S. authorities denied her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum requests in the United States, as countries with serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Raisin said Friday that the new policy ignores decades of legislative experience in the states, the nation and the world.
"Federal law requires that asylum applications be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle", the analytical note states.
The lawyers also stated in a note that a policy that denies immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that often immigrants can become entrepreneurs and "create the jobs we need".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer provide asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion", Sessions said on June 11, announcing the policy.
Shelter has never been the solution to the problems, even the most serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, while searching for survivors, doubled the number of deaths.
Those who survive are in a very difficult situation.
"It's very tense", says the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, reassuring her young son about the temperature in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palo.
Every minute, a fast machine is bringing bodies.
Clean water is very little.
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes, clearing away the wet stuff, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the Palo Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside because of the repeated heavy shots.
Tears came to his eyes as he recalled the feeling of the powerful underground tremors in his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to escape.
"I was caught in the ruins of the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard the wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "threats" using "propaganda" advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page ad in an American daily extolling the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid-for China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials in a Reuters interview called a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, Beijing and Washington have now unleashed a trade war, resulting in the mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
The repressive tariffs, US and Chinese experts said, were introduced to hurt exporters like Iowa businessmen who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, is now doubling down on its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the good American tradition of free speech and a free press by printing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstead wrote.
"If you look at the newsstands in Beijing, you don't find many votes against it and you don't see a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory of the economy, given the fact that the press is under the iron fist of the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most influential newspapers had declined to publish his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans pushing women voters away ahead of midterm elections in Kavanaugh's fiasco, analysts warn
While many prominent Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that they will be hit back, especially by women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and a majority of Republicans are already indicating that they are ready to vote.
"These things are irreversible", Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Richor said he wasn't sure whether the announcement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake of an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow and in November", Corinne Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November soon!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby, when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christina Blasey Ford's announcement, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be tremendous", Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say they're high, and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban female voters and young voters between 18 and 29 who don't like the president, but often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she detailed her accusations of a Supreme Court nominee for sexual abuse, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmation, there could be a strong blow in return.
"For the Republican Party, it's become a bit of a mess", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, but it's about how the Republicans handled it and how they reacted", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided on whether Ford or Kavanaugh are right, with a slightly more favorable view of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents probably or not very likely trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they probably or not very likely trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may have lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push by Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, when he was drunk, was trying to get her when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch the New Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is built on an open platform called Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has permission to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that when he created Inrupt, he meant to "rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online data warehouses or PODs.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, fanbooks, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user can determine who has access to what type of information.
They call it personal empowerment with data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to give the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, process and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, a few contractors working on the project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change if all their business models are immediately revised.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem protection to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential advocate for net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honoring the Victorian Cross-Born Priest of the First World War
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van was awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Belenglis and Lecourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper's bullet, never knowing that he had received Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday, in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin through a thick fog and under heavy enemy gun and machine gun fire.
Then he ran into the line of fire and with great courage led the soldiers forward, seizing the gun himself and knocking out three units.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war was over.
Michael Wang, 72, said that what his grandfather did was something that I would never be able to do and also something worth respecting.
He and his brother Dr. James Wang also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said it was a great honor for him to attend the parade, and added that the courage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support given by many.
MMA fans have been waiting all night to see Bellator 206, they got Pep's pig instead
Just imagine, you've been standing out all night to watch a packed broadcast from Bellator 206, and then you're denied access to the main event.
The San Jose show had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they were broadcast live all night on British Channel 5.
And at 6 a.m., as Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, the British audience was stunned when the show switched to Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after having spent a sleepless night, specifically waiting for this fight.
One fan on Twitter called the switch to a children's cartoon "someone's stupid joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said, "According to government orders at 6 a.m., this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to a children's program".
Yes, "Pig Pepa". I was like,
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they would work on a program to accommodate the British audience.
"I think we'll discuss the possibility of a repeat, I think we can solve this issue", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday in our time, and it's Monday in their time.
But we're doing the best we can.
Trust me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem, thinking it was a technical flaw.
But it turned out to be a government policy.
I promise you, this won't happen next time.
We're going to cut the number of shots from six to five, as we normally do, and we wanted to please the fans, but we overdid it.
This is a bitter situation.
"Disk of a deserted island": Tom Daley felt "outcast" because of his sexuality.
Olympic diving champion Tom Daley said that he grew up feeling insignificant to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation on his way to success.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that not everyone was like me until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Disk of a Desolate Island" hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he said he supports the right of gay people to give others hope.
He also said that when he had a baby, he started to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional host of this rather old program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
In the role of a man on a deserted island in the first LaVerne program, Daley said that as a child, he felt inferior to everyone else because society rejected those who liked both boys and girls.
He said, "I still think that feeling of being different and insignificant was what gave me the power and inspiration to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was somebody, he said, because he didn't want to disappoint anyone who found out he was sexual.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent activist in the LGBT movement and at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, he called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he spoke out because he was lucky enough to live openly, free from persecution, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the man -- the American screenwriter, director and producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- it was unexpected.
Daly married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he said the age difference doesn't matter.
When you go through something like that at such a young age, he got into his first Olympics at 14, and three years later his father died of cancer. He said it was hard to find a peer who would go through such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, and their son is Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his perspective had changed completely.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I need to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things in this world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robby  this is my Olympic gold medal.
His son is also named Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics  he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be sitting in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life", he said, "and that jumping in front of my fans at the Olympics is the best feeling I've ever had".
It also influenced the selection of the song  Proud by Heather Small  which found a response in it in the preparation for the Olympics and from which ants still run.

Mikkelsen, who is out of form, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set the record on Sunday with his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to get back in shape to keep the event from turning into a disaster.
Mickelson, who will play in this biennial tournament, a record 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyck for the Saturday forbounds.
Instead of being the center of attention, which he was often for the United States team, the five-time World Cup winner divided his days between working as a cheerleader and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National course, where inaccurate strokes are severely punished.
And if the field itself isn't gloomy enough, Mickelson will face British Open defending champion Francesco Malinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who along with Tommy Fleetwood has won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the first 12 singles games, start with a good start, Michelson's match could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this player, but could say nothing more.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, and said he'd be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He's very confident.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot to the team last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two matches.
I had planned more, but it worked just like that and that's how we thought we'd play.
He wants to be on the field just like everyone else.
Mickelson is breaking Nick Fuld's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that's never been as good as the individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyck said his presence benefited the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with a sense of humor, likes to make fun of people and just a really nice guy who's good to have on the team", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed parroting his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team much more than just a game.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Byrne, knows that the big gap could soon disappear.
Thomas Byrne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before the individual games of the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderm, where the European team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimal advantage of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You constantly remind yourself that in Valdermón we had a big advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost", Byrne said after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, and fall 10-6 at Le Golf National.
And what this story tells me and everyone else in the team is that this is not the end.
Tomorrow we have to play at all 100.
Get out on the field and do it right.
Until the points are on the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal and that is to try and win this trophy, and that's what we're going to focus on.
I say this all the time, I'm focused on the 12 guys on our side, but we understand very well that on the other side are the best players in the world.
Pleased with how his players played on the heavy golf course, Björn added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow is a completely different game.
Tomorrow is the individual games, and that's different.
It's great when you're on the field with a partner and it's going great, but when you're playing alone, that's where your true golf skills come into play.
That's what you have to tell the players, that they have to do their best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, you have to go to the pit and also show your best as an individual player.
Unlike Byrne, his rival Jim Furyk expects his athletes to play better individually than they did in partnership, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last day's matches, playing on the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every word of it", he said, answering a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was setting his players up for the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but you always want to have a quick start, like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the speed increases, the most pressure is on those who play the matches in the middle.
We've put the schedule together, we've put the players in the right places, and you know, tomorrow we're going to try to get some magic.
Thomas is assigned to start and will play against Rory McIlroy in the main event, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rum, Tommy Fleetwood, and Jan Poulter will play against top golfers.
"I put my players in this order because I think it closes everything", Björn said of his individual match selections.
The launch of a new German warship is again postponed
The new German Navy frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace older Cold War war ships, but it won't be until next year due to faulty systems and ever-increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014, but post-construction problems have hampered this ambitious project.
Four warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They will be armed with powerful guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stel technology, such as reduced radar visibility, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics  longer periods between maintenance  newer frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships that can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country are obsolete by the time they finally enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have written about numerous software and hardware defects that render the ship useless in combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class have only 120 sailors  half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was very heavy, which reduced its productivity and limited the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, twice the weight of the ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
Aside from the broken equipment, the cost of the entire project including the training of the crew also becomes a problem.
The price reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion)  despite initially being 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that accumulate with new frigates are made especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, said the Navy "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions".
He said the problem is growing over time, as old ships are being scrapped and there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were capable of joining the Navy.
The National Monument Protection Society has been listening in on the secret life of the bat.
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is exploring how the humpback whale uses the landscape to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find new insights into the unique behavior of these flying mammals and help with future conservation efforts.
The National Trust for Scotland's research into the small-eared bat and the brown-eared bat of Dobanton in Inverurie Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations throughout the area to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
Society staff and volunteers will conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all the sounds recorded determines the frequency of the calls made by the bats, as well as which bats do what.
The habitat map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, a consultant for the National Society for the Conservation of Nature, hopes the findings will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information can help to determine the benefits of creating habitats like meadows, and how to maintain forests for the habitat of bats and other related animals.
The number of speakers in Scotland and Great Britain has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect and destroy their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as can fly-tape and some building materials, and domestic cats.
The Kajan are not blind at all.
However, because of their nocturnal life, the ears of the humpback whales are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Society, which is responsible for over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes the bat very seriously.
It is staffed by ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, check-ins, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even established the first and only Scottish buffalo reserve at the Trew Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten buffalo species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says it's the perfect habitat for bats.
"Here at Three, we have just a great place for the bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we still don't know much about bats, so our work here and on other estates will help us understand more about what they need for a better life.
He stresses the importance of checking for buffalo before carrying out any renovation of the property, as it is possible to inadvertently destroy one saddle, killing up to 400 females and young buffaloes, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
The cows are protected and are forbidden to kill, intimidate, disturb or destroy their saddles.
Elizabeth Farrall, of the Scottish Whale Conservation Association, is urging the public to help.
She says, "We have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many species live".
Ronaldo denies the rape charges and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called his allegations of rape "fake news", saying people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
The forward of the Portugal national team and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Major in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he allegedly paid her $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million followers hours after the accusations were posted, calling the post "fake news".
I'm not going to do that.
Today's news is fake news, said the five-time Golden Ball winner in front of the camera.
They want to advertise my name.
That's all right.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm a happy and kind man", he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in a private case", Reuters reports.
Christian Schertz, the attorney, said the player would seek compensation for moral damages in an amount that matches the severity of the violation, and is perhaps the most serious violation of privacy in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a luxury room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Major were allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the anal, according to court documents in Clark County, Nevada.
The major claims that after that, Ronaldo got down on his knees and said that 99 percent he was a good guy who suffered from 1 percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but with their consent.
The major also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was very afraid of revenge and worried that she would be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to reopen the case because she feels emotionally traumatized by the case.
At a time when this incident was supposed to have taken place, Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing a deal for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of its car industry
Britain will "always regret" losing its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was "concerned" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cut production at its Barnstone plant near Derby by half.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the delay at the border as a result of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Barnston plant where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's head of Barnston.
Other UK carmakers have raised the question of how cross-border trade will play out if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is announcing that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that carmakers are talking about the risk to supply chains from a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be border cuts that lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota will be unable to keep parts at the Derby plant for more than a day, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checker Plan for the future relationship with the EU was designed precisely to avoid these border checks.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will not only allow us to have the success we have today, but allow us to take that opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The data we're getting, not just from Toyota, but from other companies, is that we need to be able to keep our successful supply chains going.
Toyota could not say how long the plant would be shut down, but warned that the cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvariis, who has been working at Barnstone for 24 years and is a union coordinator, said that union members are very concerned: In my experience, once jobs are cut, they will never recover.
A government spokesman said: "We have offered a clear plan for our future relationship with the EU that is trustworthy".
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed" for another week, while the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh rages, a White House spokesman said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the assistant attorney general, and thus endangers Mueller's independence, is fueling the Washington gossip fires for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refuted that.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that he would meet with Trump on Thursday, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh was speaking with one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI weekly investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, further slowing down the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It's not scheduled yet, maybe this week, maybe next week, I think it's more like a week later, given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court case.
But it's going to happen, and I always keep the press updated.
Some journalists are willing to dispute her claim: Sanders hasn't given a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of briefings was due to a disdain for the public-facing news reporters, though she added: "I accept the fact that they are public-facing".
Then she said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more press meetings than any president before him", she said, adding without elaborating: "We've been looking at those numbers".
The briefings are happening, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than doing it through me.
We're trying to do this often, you've seen us do it in the last few weeks, and the kind of meetings where you can ask the president a question directly, they replace briefings.
Trump is a regular on-the-record question when he leaves the White House or takes part in street meetings or press conferences with high-profile foreign guests.
Press conferences by the president himself are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, in his freely and sometimes extravagantly speaking to reporters.
Health Minister wrote to EU workers in Scotland's health care system before Brexit
The Health Minister has written to EU workers working in Scotland's healthcare system to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and wish they would stay after Brexit.
Jane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government is already willing to cover the cost of residency applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU have been in negotiations over the summer leading to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government also rushed to prepare for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubled time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I value the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU and beyond are providing valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve health care, and benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland  is your home and we really want you to stay with us.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Sunday game his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the break.
"He went over to the sideline and suddenly fell", said Reed.
The coaches and paramedics gave Abercomby oxygen while still on the field, before putting him on the stretcher and carrying him for diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there were no details about what the injury was, and Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the player got injured.
Abercomb, a sophomore athlete, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five complete interceptions, giving him just 18 interceptions in the season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay higher duties
Under the Conservators' new plan, overseas buyers of British real estate will pay higher fees, and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes what is considered a success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The rising tariffs will hit those who fail to pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay higher government fees, and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters and provide affordable housing for high-income people.
The tax increases target individuals and businesses who don't pay taxes in the UK, and the money will go to the government's homeless shelter program.
The current increase in the state fee, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, for second homes and rental housing, could be as high as 3 percent.
The Treasury hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to buy their first home.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns, as a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the state's fees for young buyers to make it easier to buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to create a "disgraceful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of vocal housing reforms, including controlling rents and ending unwarranted evictions.
He also wants to give the local councils more power in the housing sector.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my term as Prime Minister to restoring the British Dream -- to making life better for every new generation.
It means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build their life here.
However, it's unfair that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy property as easily as working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage the Scottish national team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said that his main ambition is to one day become the coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is on a mission to reclaim the North-East club, which is now in third place in the Premier League, three points from first.
He moved to the job in the summer, after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
I grew up playing for Scotland in Hampden Stadium with my dad, and something always made me come back.
But that's the kind of opportunity that comes when I'm a successful club coach.
Among the coaching staff of the Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyer and Paul DiCagna.
The former coach of Aloha Athletic says he was not afraid of such big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Now, luck for me would be the answer to the question, "Will I be able to get this club back into the Premier League?"
According to the structure and material base of the club his place is probably in the Premier League, "he said.
Not just bring him back, but I'll consider my work successful only if I can bring the club back.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked 15 months in the coaching staff of Hearts.
Then he helped Aloha back from the third division and turned Saint Mirren from a loser who almost got into the championship to the winner the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Looking back on working at Aloha, he said, "It was a really important choice".
I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than playing.
It sounds amazing, because I was doing a good job, I was making a good salary, and I was getting to the top.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what it takes.
I've always wanted to train, and I'm doing it now, and I think it's the best time of my adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Saturday, September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 1:00 PM British Summer Time.
According to a study, the perfect time to drink a pint of beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The hot summer has boosted the profits of British pubs, which are struggling to survive, but it has put pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the statistics, the pub and bar group recorded a sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants the sales volume decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy group that compiled the statistics said: "The sunny weather and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup final means that in July we had what we had in June, when pubs increased sales by 2.8 percent, and restaurants suffered even more.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars, which mostly sell drinks, have so far shown the best results as opposed to restaurants.
Pubs with more food also got sunburned, though not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, the sales of drinks went up 6.6 percent, and food went down 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and accommodation analyst, said: "These results are a trend we've been seeing since late April.
Weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
No wonder restaurants are still struggling, with sales down 4.8 percent year-on-year, which is very unpleasant when prices are going up.
The long, hot summer came at a bad time for food-focused operators, and time will tell whether the lower temperatures in August will bring the expected relief.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracking tool for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is a key reference in the industry.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents.
A study found that one in five children -- some as young as 11 -- have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
This news has heated up fears of sexual content being posted there.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account that showed their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts that appear to lead to a photo sharing site.
This news has heated up fears of sexual content being posted there.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept clean basic accounts to show their parents, and they kept private accounts, too.
One mother, who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found out that she had been encouraged by others to "rape me".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of teenagers aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where neither parents nor teachers can find them".
Eileen Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eald Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer board member at the annual general meeting of that body.
Doyle  Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her experience at a wide variety of levels, including international over the last decade.
"Aylind is held in high regard in Scotland, the UK and the global sporting community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her work on the board", Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the athletes and hopefully help run the sport in Scotland".
An American who won gold in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as a pundit for the BBC, can't walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and how much.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing back-to-back exercises!

A milk pump ad where mothers are compared to cows shared online
A milk pump company shared the opinion by running an ad that compared breastfeeding women to milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of what they call the world's first infant-fed milk pump, consumer company Elvie released a satirical music commercial based on the video to show the freedom that this device gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in the barn with cows under a song that has words like, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a wart, it's my breast".
And he was like, "Dai, dai, I'm feeding my kids, dai, dai, I'm feeding my women".
However, the ad placed on the company's Facebook page sparked a heated debate online.
It's had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and the reaction has been mixed, with many saying it's a dairy horror.
It's a very bad idea to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, only to have their babies removed a few days later", one viewer wrote.
Elvie's milk pump is hidden in the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
One more comment: "Of course, it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who don't have their babies aborted?
Someone said, "This is such a wild ad.
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote, "Funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would love to have one that I could breastfeed.
Sucking the milk off makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
"This is a brilliant product", she wrote.
Another comment: A very entertaining advertisement aimed at mothers who suck their milk out of the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel sick.
This is not a promotion or a condemnation of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women are dancing with their invisible breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is hidden in the breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, allowing them to hold their babies, and even leave the house while the device is running.
Ana Ballarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said, "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a definite and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the difficulty of milk draining, while demonstrating in a fun and fun way how the new milk pump will bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium wearing Martha Jacobsky's clothes, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are quietly transported to tent camps on the Texas border.
While the number of border crossings per month has remained almost unchanged, the number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, partly due to the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to risk their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would be required to file fingerprints and the data would be passed on to immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, presented to Congress a report about the agency's arrests of dozens of people who had requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant portion of them are foreigners with criminal records.
So we keep chasing these people", said Mr. Albens.
To speed up the children's treatment, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of their detention, which, according to shelter workers, used to be 60 days.
A lot of people will have to file their own legal status with an immigration judge over video instead of going to court in person.
Those deemed unfit to provide assistance were quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources inside the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to develop depression or increase anxiety, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates say that in larger institutions like Tarnilla, these problems are much more pronounced, as signs that a child is in a miserable state are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent city without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many have already experienced.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of occupying forces from US, France and Turkey
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualim also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war, which is now in its eighth year.
Mu'alem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without conditions", he told the Assembly.
Mu'alem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, the war against terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus intends to continue this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly acting as instructors and advisers to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's ground contingent in this war-torn country is over 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions for return are favorable and blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fears that keep refugees abroad.
"We urge the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return", he says.
They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has opened the door to further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, including representatives from the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections in the near future.
Muallem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Run for Second Term
This logic will win Mr. Trump in the 2020 election, when, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal won't end his presidency prematurely.
And this will be, without a doubt, the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
So far, there are no signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has 3.5 million viewers, surpassing the cable ratings for the evening news headlines.
"This is the fire that people are drawn to because we don't understand it", says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama "The Successor", about a cabinet member who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nellie Scowell, the brilliant comedy writer and author of "A Few Funny Details and Some Hard Truths" about breaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She mentions a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Mr. Trump.
 Why?  she asked.
He answered, Because it amuses me,  Miss Scovell told me.
Chaos is also valuable in that it can entertain.
Of course, unlike the rest of television, the storylines coming out of Washington could be as defining to the future as the case of Roe v. Wade, depending on whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring  a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour as a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of non-publishing information in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, and the consequences of Storm Daniels' harsh descriptions, um, of Mr. Trump's anatomy, it goes beyond simply wanting to be up to date.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"Part of what he does is make you feel like you're watching a reality show that he shows every night", says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's changing cast and constant plot twists.
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll miss out.
When I was talking to Mr. Fleas this week, it was a hot, sunny day outside the windows of his house on the north shore of Kauai, and it was 30 degrees, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh rebelled before the Senate Judiciary Committee, debating the future of the Supreme Court, which hung in the balance.
I remember back in the day, when we had these crazy shows, and people were like, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.

Foreign cash flows are pouring into the tough midterm race for the House of Representatives.
It's no wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is in a financial slump because of the congressional boundary changes that put two candidates in the race for one seat.
Pittsburgh's newly redrawn suburb surrounds Democrat Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in last spring's primary.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts had been unconstitutionally counted in favor of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in campaign funding by the financial groups of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely publicized midterm elections in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States evaluated the possibility of punishing Salvador for supporting China and then backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already backed Beijing's position despite little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until his partners evicted Trump's leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the recent decisions to not recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only applied to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be damaging to the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings concluded, representatives from North and Central America postponed holding a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively stopped discussing the issue of El Salvador's execution.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration is in favor of holding the event.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by another analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Learn from history
The next step might be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, examples of which are now found in very strong evidence in public documents.
Mr. Mueller reportedly drew attention to the possibility of a Trump campaign and Russian conspiracy in the election attack.
If Congress changes hosts, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, just as he is preparing to address the electorate again, and perhaps eventually, a jury of his colleagues.
There are many "cases", and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's fall is as inevitable as the fall of his peers in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that determine how long this fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
History is wrapped around turning points like this, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Right now, Americans are facing a few of these turning points.
What would happen if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bind since the paper reported that he had offered to secretly record the president's words last year and was debating his professional suitability.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times is inaccurate.
What will we do if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh's case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is approved by the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in a congressional election that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these challenges, we're going to have a long winter for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, based in Washington, D.C., and author of The Last Palace: A Turbulent Century of Europe in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after a dramatic draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month will give them a clear exit from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season, a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use the result as a springboard.
This was a big game for us because Villarreal are a tough opponent, and the 31-year-old is distracted.
We started the game thinking we could win something, and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have scored the ball at the end, but overall the draw was also a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we got ourselves together, and we had the better half of the field.
There will be another important night for European football on Thursday.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game, since they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans in the stands, I'm sure we can beat them and play a good game.
Last year was definitely tough, both because of my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys are really enjoying the game; the training is productive.
Hopefully, we can move forward, surpass last season's record and make it happen.
Women are losing sleep over the fear of retirement accumulations
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of the type of care they wanted for themselves, few of them had talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in the national survey said they had talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to discuss it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
That's a good place to start.
Discuss it with your husband and children, and your family will not be willing to help you unless you make your wishes known.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical care, as this choice can be a big factor in determining the cost.
Involve a financial advisor in the discussion. He or she may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps cover these costs, or you can self-insure your life  provided you have the money.
Solve legal paperwork: anticipate court battles.
Get a health care trust to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that your wishes are fulfilled by the professionals in case you can't speak.
Also, consider a trust for financial management.
Appoint someone you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid when you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Imagine your elderly father is in urgent need of medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer my questions about banned drugs and allergies?
Write down these details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are involved, but also the professionalism of the doctors", Martin adds.
What medication do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan.
At Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The man received several shots from a pneumatic rifle as he walked home at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. local time, as an "accidental incident".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking witnesses to contact them.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Because of the disconnection, humanitarian officials were unable to get any information from the Donggala Regency, a district north of Palo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about the island of Palau and Dongola in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala  is a regency that extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency  is an administrative unit with a status lower than a province, in 2017 it had 299,200 inhabitants.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstay of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mostly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the Dongla tsunami, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
A tsunami also hit the western part of the Dongla in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the ruins of the buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Pailing, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Pailing, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a woman she knew tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took her phone.
According to the channel KTUU, Palin is in the Matanu-Susitna detention center under a $500 bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "clearly innocent" when asked if he pleaded guilty, the network reported.
Paine is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, for which he faces up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused of sexual misconduct.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a domestic violence report, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed by the tsunami
At least 384 people died in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of the attack were circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo, when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are calling for a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City bombing.
The New York State Attorney General's Office is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saifov, suspected of the New York City bombing that killed eight people - a rare execution that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipow, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot truck in October to drive on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify the death sentence, according to a notice of intent to execute filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipow "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both offenses are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury stunned Saipov with a 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of racketeering-related murder, a charge typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of assault and vehicular destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "careful and deliberate planning", and when describing Saif's crimes, they used phrases such as "disgusting, cruel and disorderly".
Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevés, Ana-Lori Decadent, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Ernán Ferrucho, Ernán Diego Méndas and Alejandro Damián Pagúnko, as stated in the message of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last criminal trial of capital punishment in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Hallid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipow, who is originally from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was satisfied with what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipow told authorities that he was inspired to attack by watching an Islamic State video on his phone.
He also asked for permission to hang an Islamic State flag in the hospital ward, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipav, said they were "definitely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the pain of these events for all involved", said Pathan.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Today, at a protest at the Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the People's Army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel uncomfortable with Eurosceptics since one of the MPs, Theresa May, has proposed her candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that Britain would have already left if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faced in trying to reconcile her divided supporters was made worse when the Tories, who are pro-EU, held a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the compromised Checker deal under constant pressure from both pro- and anti-Brexit parties, as well as the EU itself.
The allies have been pushing for a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between the package and the mess.
Mr. Boone said at a rally in Salihalle, "Leave Means Leave", that he wants to take Checker off the board.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made an equal and be put in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I'm for Brexit, but we need to get away from the Checker Plan".
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight the world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely unrealistic".
Andrea Jenkins, a Tory and Brexit supporter, was also at the march, and she told reporters, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checker Plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually going out and voting for us.
Please drop the plan and start listening.
In a sharp response to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers stay in office if they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that politicians need to feel uncomfortable if they're going to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "You're not going to get away with it".
In his address to the thrilled crowd, he added: "I want you to make those politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We will mobilize the people's army of this country, which gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the anti-exit protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they faced over the opening party programme.
"These are people telling us that they can have ready to use IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus, for a border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to keep a close eye on the presidential campaign.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will "pay close attention to the presidential process".
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday spoke about her future at a general meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election, facing Republican Jeff Dill, who was the co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was the subject of much speculation as a potential 2020 Trump rival.
This was the 36th meeting with voters in the General Assembly format since Trump took office, which took place on Saturday afternoon in Halifax.
One of the participants asked her if she was running for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington, D.C. and fix a broken government, and we need a woman to lead it".
The arrest came after the death of Louisiana State University basketball player Sims.
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced Saturday that a suspect in the murder of USL basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the man who was in the shooting.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday morning outside the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade pretended to be a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, being armed, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) junior at Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, 10 of which he started, averaged 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and made 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton came close to the title of world champion after winning by mutual agreement over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Walter Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions within the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas pulled out a good seat at the raffle and almost left Hamilton to his fate as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first went to the pit-stop and left Hamilton to bounce at the end of the total mass of the racers, it was this maneuver that was to become decisive.
The pilot of the Mercedes went to a pit stop a lap later and got out behind Fettel, but Hamilton got ahead after several round-trip maneuvers that forced the driver of the Ferrari to leave the interior free, risking holding back after a double maneuver to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Fersteppen started from the back of the grid on his 21st birthday and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race, while the tyres were held, because he wanted to finish fast, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He ended up with a pit stop on lap 44, but he couldn't increase speed on the remaining eight laps, so Rykannen finished fourth.
It was a hard day, for Walter had been fantastic all weekend and had shown himself a real gentleman, if I may say so.
"The team did a great job to finish first and second", Hamilton commented.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she was not the source of a leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people can be "wicked, disgusting, and untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's been happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly, lying people", he said.
If you read about the press releases and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
That's not me.
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost your paper  oy, oh, what?
No, no. I was just thinking.
I didn't get anything from him.
Wait a minute. I'm going to go.
We let it slip... No, we didn't", he added, teasing the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing the charges Ford had brought against Kavan, and he escaped in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her story leak", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I granted her request.
But her refusal probably didn't sit well with the president, who commented at a Saturday rally: "Here's what I'll tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen
In continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means.
You see the mean, the filthy, and they don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, "says the president of Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars  Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars played off Friday's defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League, winning a 5-3 home win on Saturday.
Thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Baviere, the Giants led by two chips at the start.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were tied before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Boucher from Dundee equalized the score, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen scored two goals to secure the team's victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League in a season, as they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in a season; the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwyer from a pass by Kendall McFollow, and four minutes later Bavilier doubled the score after a pass by David Rutherford.
In the first period (13:10), Sullivan opened the score with the home team, and then Cowan tied the score after a 15-16 pass by Matt Markward.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead at the first break, scoring his second touchdown of the game late in the first period.
The taking side regrouped, and Boucher again leveled the score by scoring a draw with the team outnumbered (27:37).
Cowan and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee to their first ever match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win along with the team's number five in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play their final home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies while saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia died heroically, ensuring the successful take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive earthquake on Sulawesi island on Friday triggered a tsunami.
The powerful underground tremors are still ongoing, and many people are buried under the rubble in the city of Palo.
While his colleagues were trying to escape, 21-year-old Antonio Hunawan Ogun refused to leave his post at the control tower, which was wildly swaying at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palo.
He remained in place until the flight 6321 of the company Batik Air, which was at that moment on the runway, was torn from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, when he decided it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australian program ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirito, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had a helicopter from Baliquipana to Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Paula.
"Our hearts are broken", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, and the Disaster Risk Reduction Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
Sutopa Purva Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency, said: "The number of victims may increase further as many bodies have not yet been excavated from under the rubble".
Waves that reached up to six meters devastated Palo, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, bodies are being brought in by fast cars.
There is no clean water.
Shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the military, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by the Lambok earthquakes, which killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: One person missing after plane crashes in lagoon, reports Air Niugini
The airline that operated the flight that made the emergency landing in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane, and now reports one passenger as missing without a trace.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday it could not report the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately disclose details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after landing the plane on the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday; all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane jumped the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane was flying very low.
"That's very lucky", said Jane.
He said he and others managed to get their way through the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was already sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began screaming, and that he also suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing nearby docks also helped in the rescue, using a burning boat to carry people ashore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes of Papua New Guinea-registered aircraft over the past 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst recalls the course of events on the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, gave testimony for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Roulet said he had location information from several cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements.
When the fact that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone when he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford was confirmed, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford gave testimony on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked Tallis if he was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that night, he said that he was lying, since my van was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was Telles's assertion that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Their cell phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
According to Roulet, some time after Chambers' death, Tallis deleted all of her messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He's wiped her out of his life", said Haley.
The side defenses should begin the disputing sides on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive settings.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, states that hip-hop has moved away from its roots: political statements and extrasocial issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Akala and Lowkey brought back such collectives as The Fugees and Common to popularity in the UK.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues married couple for racist post-firing message
A New York nanny sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a random text message from her mother complaining that she's another black person.
The couple denies being racist, equating the lawsuit to "competition".
In 2016, Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Gisele Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work.
"No, it's only a black woman", Mrs. Plasco-Floxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent a message twice to Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Plazko-Flaxman dismissed Miss Morris, claiming that her former nanny, who was also African-American, was not doing well at work, and that she was waiting for her Filipino.
Miss Morris was paid for a day's work and sent home on Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and demanding compensation for her dismissal under the same terms as her original contract, even though it was not a contract: $350 a day for six months of residence.
"I want to show them that you can't do that", she told the Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, arguing that firing Morris was a wise decision, given that they could not trust her after she had been circumcised.
My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", said Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
Would you trust your children to someone who was abused, even accidentally?
Your baby?
Is that so?
Plazko equates the lawsuit to "competition" and reports that his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
And you would persecute a man in such a position?
It's pretty tough", added an investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, sharply criticizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not sympathize with the talking bear, said a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
So interesting to read, already knowing about Paddington's huge success.
She said that her father, who worked for the BBC before he dared to write a children's book about a little toy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was not accepted, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not at all boastful", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a fatherly pride for a child to have accomplished something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your credit.
I think he viewed Paddington's success precisely in that key.
Although it was his creation, a product of his imagination, he always gave Paddington what he deserved.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Nad called regularly to tell me that everything was really bad, that she couldn't stand it", said Mrs. Edna-Laperousa.
Then she called me Over to say that she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly leaving her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the very end.
I just had to sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't moan, or scream, or cry because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I had to stick with it".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapéroux, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers -- and they had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I bowed my head and tears flowed down my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was in flight that I was overwhelmed by Ned's compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women mourning hang suicide warning cards on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones, who ended up committing suicide, are doing everything they can to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hang cards with messages of love and phone numbers for people to get help on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel like I feel", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room.
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the unpleasant consequences".
Ms. Davis created the cards to let people know that there are people in the world you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent  you need to talk.
Ms. Hasfress, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He wasn't saying he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On Christmas day, he was very depressed: when the children opened the presents, he didn't even look at them.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to live with it: "There was a huge hole in the family".
It just kills us.
But you have to keep living and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI investigates
"I thought we could have what he wants in a limited time and scope of investigation, we can get some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was dissolving because it was actually stuck.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is sometimes explained by time.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6th. If the Republicans are expected to lose, then they will be weakened in their efforts to elect the Supreme Court nominee they need.
George W. Bush called the senator to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases their report?
There's a vote in the Senate, which is currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the issue of equal votes and get it approved by the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has declined under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo-sun, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reasons were the increased border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices that smugglers have set for shipping.
Pyongyang did not comment on this.
Most of the defectors are from the North and they get South Korean citizenship for a reason.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This comes after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed on a common timetable for working towards the goal of completely denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and in such circumstances we are not going to disarm first", Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a hysteric, saying he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh a hysteric and said his temperament was unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called a 'hysterical' person", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's speech to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blazy Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and unable to speak when his family and high school classes were discussed.
He also blamed Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and organized assassination" by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's speech showed he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because he clearly showed he had a bias against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself by his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only should he not be working in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he's working now", Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about potential decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect us to say 'how wonderful'", Pelosi said.
And a woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified accusation, months and years of anger just pouring in, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years ago.
I don't think it's that rare.
And she said, "I was really helped by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and she said, 'When I get angry, I cry, but I've learned a technique, and when she gets angry and starts crying, she says, 'Well, maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
But I get mad.
And I just kept going.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed in part as an outlet for grief, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of my first job, where I cried with unspeakable anger, was when I was grabbed by an elderly woman -- a restrained boss who always frightened me a little -- and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they'll be glad to have you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was caught in a betrayal on a yacht called Monkey Business and dropped out of the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, thought she might be running for president herself.
"It wasn't a very well-thought-out decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates, and they didn't need me.
Someone called this "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
And since the campaign had been going for quite a while, she didn't have the resources, so she said she wouldn't run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turns out that some of her fans who gave the men $1,000 only gave her $250.
"They think I'm going with a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not run, she was so overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so hard to get money and targeted voters rather than candidates, and anger at sexism -- that she couldn't breathe.
"You might think I'm having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her condition.
You might think that my corporate sponsor is the Kleenex paper towel company.
I used to wonder what they would write on my headstone.
"She was crying"?
Why a China-US trade war might be good for Beijing
The initial outbursts of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and since the war is far from over, experts say that in the longer term, misunderstandings between the countries may be in Beijing's favor.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, when the new tariffs hit a total of $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods that enter the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing has responded in the same way, recently raising tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the second-largest economy is hardly going to be noticed.
To get Washington to back down, you have to go deeper into demands, but publicly bending to the US is practically unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing uses the situation properly, the pressure of a U.S. trade war could in the long run support China, reducing the two countries' interdependence.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that will trigger a process of sharp economic decline is far more dangerous than observers previously thought", said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia at the Center for New American Security Research.
Syria ready for refugee return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorism to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for the return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily life and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alim said the Syrian regime would gladly accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. will lose for the sixth time in a row on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, the points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled the most in the tournament, drove his ball into the water on 3 pairs of the 16th hole, giving up this match to Francesco Malinari.
Italian golfer Malinarri excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to pass that field with a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spice was knocked out with a score of 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thornbjörn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia is the most-capped player in the tournament with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to return the cup.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed the relay to his countryman John Ramu, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in singles 2&1.
"I'm very proud to have won against Tiger Woods, a man whose career I've watched since I was a kid", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was competing with each other except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Toney Finns, who played all the way through the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury of the U.S.A. said after a disappointing game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning, we were showing Europe what it could do.
We struggled.
Let's take our hats off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, and I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take your hat off in front of them.
We were overrun.
Red tide: Concentration is decreasing in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decline in the concentration of red tide in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the committee's information, there are reports of isolated blooming sites in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Callie counties, indicating a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of the red tide stretches approximately 130 miles (200 km) of the coastline from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
You can find blooms about 10 miles from shore in Hillsborough County, but they're decreasing compared to last week.
The red tide was also seen in the Easter district.
The average concentration on or near shore in Pinellas County was low to high in Hillsborough last week. In Manato, the background was high, on or near shore in Saratoga County the concentration was high to low, in Charlotte County the background was medium, on or near shore in Lee County the background was high and in Callie County the concentration was low.
Respiratory irritation has been reported in Pinellas County, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Callie counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida in the past week.
