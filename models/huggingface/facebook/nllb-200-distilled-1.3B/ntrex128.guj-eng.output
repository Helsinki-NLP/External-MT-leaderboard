Whales' AM was concerned about a Muppet-like appearance.
Some AMs are upset at the suggestion to change their title to MWPS (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
It arose due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs across the political spectrum were concerned that it might cause ridicule.
1 A worker said that his group was concerned about the matching of TWP and PWP2.
For readers outside Whales 1: Whales TWP means stupid and PWP means stupid.
Plaid AM said the whole group was not happy and suggested alternatives.
The Whales' conservative said his group was open-minded about the name change, but noted it was a brief literal jump from the MPWP to the Muppet.
In this context the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the Yorkshire English letter U.
The Legislative Commission which drafted the law for the name change said: Any final decision on the description of what the members of the Legislative Assembly will be called will certainly be theirs.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public consultation organised on proposals which identified widespread support for the Assembly to be known as the Whales Parliament.
The Commission favoured the Whales MPs or WMPs on the issue of the title of AM, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
The AM seems to be suggesting alternatives, but getting a consensus for the authorized official from whom the changes are expected to be submitted in a week could be a headache for the raw draft law.
The amended Act will incorporate other changes in the way the Assembly functions, including rules on disqualification of AM and design of committee system.
When AM debates the law, they will have the final vote on the question of what they should be known as.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was arranged to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long held that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly protested in its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would not consider the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zev, argued that the name change was only the price paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's had gone silent as churches in Harlem were in trouble.
"Historically, the elderly people I spoke to said there were bars and churches on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is no Kai.
He said that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
Nowadays, people socialize differently, he said.
There will no longer be bars next to residential buildings where people go regularly.
Because he was concerned for the churches that the money from the property sale would not last as long as the leaders wanted, and sooner or later they would be back where they started.
He added, condominium apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who don't help the rest of the sacred sites in the neighborhood can replace churches.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so the day is not far when these churches will be completely closed because most people who come to these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a Black metropolis - after the decade of the Metropolitan Community, St. Martin's in the year 1870.
In the 1930s the original white Methodist congregations were leaving.
Black congregations praying nearby occupied the building.
St. Martin was occupied by black gangs led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted retailers on 125th Street, the main street to shopping in Harlem, objecting to keeping or encouraging black people.
A fire in 1939 caused much damage to the building, but they began ringing bells as Father Johnson's clergy planned to rebuild.
Father Johnson's father, the Rev. David Johnson, and St. Martin's successors proudly identified the bell as the bell of the poor.
Experts who rang the bell in July called it something else: "cultural treasures" and "irreplaceable historical tools".
University of Michigan expert, Tiffany NG noted that it was the world's first phenomenon played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had been attending a large carillon in a riverside church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been happening with St. Martin's over the past few months has been a story of complex sculptures and contractors, some brought in by the church's raw leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Vestry - The parish governing body, made up of raw leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was not involved in keeping the carpenters and contractors sent by the vestry diocese, despite the diocese wanting to pass with the expense.
Some priests complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old man in a lobster dive in California.
A 13-year-old boy in California was being dived for crabs on Saturday when a shark attacked and injured him on the first day of the crab season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and then he pedalled towards him with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a crab-catching passion, but then he realized he was screaming, I kind of figured!
I got a little bit of that!
Her entire bone was opened, Hamel said, and she lost her sight when she got the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed on the critical condition list.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Life guard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not among the dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered sustained serious injuries to the upper torso.
Investigation and safety purposes officials closed the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Isinitas.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area but most are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury's plans pushed the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is hiring Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with stylish beauty expert assistants at the department store.
The large beauty product will be tested in 11 stores across the country as a sustainable boost to the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which has been growing steadily while sales of fashion and homeware have been falling and, if successful, will be taken to more stores.
Investing in beauty has been used as a way to use the sanctuary spaces reserved for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of the beauty products it offers to 3,000 items, including Revlon, Essai, Twizerman and Dr. Powpaw for the first time.
L'Oreal's current ranges Mabeline and Bruts Biz will also have more space in branded areas as seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range to make most items more fit-for-vegetarians - which is growing in demand among small shoppers.
In addition, two perfume retailers in Sunbury will experiment with discounting fragrance shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week while the second is due to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and buying small amounts of daily food from local convenience stores mean that supermarkets have a lot to do to keep people from visiting.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Cowpe, said department store-like stores would appear to be on the rise as supermarket chains try to fight back discount-giving Aldi and Liddy with more services and non-food.
Since Sunrise brought both chains in two years ago, Argos has had stores in thousands of stores and launched a number of settlements, which is said to have supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to improve their beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
In the early 2000s Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots, but the alliance ended on how to distribute a portion of the revenue from the chemist's store in their supermarkets.
New strategies have emerged since Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Salesio, owner of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds in four stores will play a role in the planning by expanding its luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche-Pose and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have improved the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance our customers' environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be helpful in providing advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs and pleasant environments and convenient locations, meaning we are now a destination for beauty products that challenge the old fashioned shopping.
Peter Jones became obsessed with the character after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal.
When TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled an £11 million deal, Dragons Dan star Peter Jones became obsessed with doing his lifestyle brand business with Mark & Spencer and ITV.
Vilughabhai doesn't really have time for her own homeware and accessories brand.
The Pearce business was merged with the Gwyneth Paltrow Group brand.
This morning the 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby, at the end of the season, put the Dragons' Dan star Peter Jones in trouble by pulling out of the lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her new big deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that at Merlo's empire headquarters in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, Jones was overwhelmed when the TV golden girl admitted to a tense meeting that she had made a new deal worth £1.5 million - meaning she didn't really have time for their homeware and accessories brands.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Group brand and doubled Willowgbai's estimated £11 million fortune.
Since Willowgwy, 37, used Instagram to announce she was actually leaving, Jones has been heading out of Britain to go to one of her holiday homerooms.
Sources said: "It is indeed the highest priority of Holi till date.
It was going to be her long-term future in which she could see herself for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, how close it was to starting.
The warehouse at Merlo Headquarters was full of goods ready for sale
Experts believe the departure of the presenter, who is one of Britain's most trusted stars, this morning could cost the company millions due to a massive blockage in its range of items from cushions and candles to clothing and homeware, potentially delaying its future launch even further.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother and husband of three Willowbhai Dan Baldwin Jones and his wife Tara Cappe were close for ten years.
Vilughabhai actually set up the setup in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Gally and Jones have a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin TV production company, with some holidays.
Wilugbai became a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones said last night that "we did not comment on his business dealings".
We had a hard time, and then we fell in love.
He joked that the news media would criticize him for making comments, some would call it "unexpected", and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump leave so much behind?
Trump said it in the voice of a news reader.
I didn't do anything wrong.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump arranged the inaugural meeting in Singapore in June, a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations to denuclearize collapsed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat RI Young Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not expecting a "relevant response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. has continued to issue approvals aimed at keeping pressure on.
Trump showed overly optimistic sentiments during his speech at the rally.
"We are doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were heading for war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now, we have this amazing relationship.
He said his efforts to mend relations with Kim have yielded good results - rocket tests have stopped, hostages have been helped to be released and the rest of the US troops have returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to get the presidency, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get in through this closed battlefield, we have 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing thousands.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told not to need it.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was temporarily displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for seeking international help.
In many cases, badnashib, they were very clear that they were not seeking international help, so, it was a bit challenging, Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is trying to get to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Indonesia is unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature as the earth is constantly shaking.
This scene is not commonly seen on the coast when tsunami shelters are built in Aceh.
Although the warning is in effect, there is apparently a possibility of loss of life due to the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu.
At best, traveling to many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make systems more complex.
A hospital ship is in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's existing infrastructure a major issue in his election campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But, the lack of funds has left Mr Joko's administration worried as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko has also faced pressure from the lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced more conservative types of denominations.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other deadly weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool deep-dive equaliser game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss against Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a 30-yard pass from outside Khedira Shakiri as his team trailed Chelsea 1-0.
He caught the ball from his left before shooting a shot towards the far post.
This effort went out of bounds as it crashed into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally the ball landed on the cappa arizabulga, which was jumping, and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to reach the ball and a player like Shaq always plays as much forward as possible, so, I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolIFC.COM.
I saw Kante coming and touching one and couldn't think about it much and just shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead of Belgian star Aidan Hazard at half-time after scoring in the 25th minute.
The blue striker passed Mateau Kovesić again in that game before he stopped spinning in the middle of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic was passing quickly in the middle of the field.
He then threw a beautiful throw ball, which put Hazard ahead in the box.
Hazard came off the defensive and ended up in the net from the far post with a left foot shot and outplayed Liverpool's Alison Baker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Studio Na Paolo in Naples, Italy.
UEFA will face Chelsea in Europe on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the roads of buildings that were brought down by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and the resulting waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380000 people, was covered with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman died
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found on Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found with a gunshot wound at 7.55am on John Street in Grayson Moss, from where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would urge anyone who is in the vicinity of the John Street area in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us".
I also urge anyone to contact us, especially taxi drivers, whose dashcam footage has caught anything as they may have information that may be important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local from Birkenhead and she was found inside the property.
Friends who thought they knew the woman this afternoon came to the scene this morning to ask questions about where she had been.
The investigation is ongoing as police said they are in the process of notifying the next of kin of the victim.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews was still trying to return to his flat but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He couldn't say anything when he found out what happened.
Now residents have been told that it will take hours to allow them to enter.
A police officer was heard to say that the entire area was now being viewed as a crime scene.
A woman with tears was seen at the scene.
She kept saying that she was very hateful.
At 2 pm, two police vans were inside the besieged area with one van outside holding it.
A number of officers were standing inside the blockade to guard the block of flats.
Anyone with information was asked to report to DM@MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111 without revealing their name by referring to log 247 dated 30th September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament has become a famous modern memorial for rewriting history.
His exile would be poetic justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works, such as the Taliban, created by his religious holy followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the current debate over the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor dragged by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been victimized by falsehood in the previous century for the actions of his ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thornecroft's brilliant representation of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century opinion and part of the chronicling of a personality many still consider important to celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was remembered as the guardian of Parliament against many external pressures, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, in this case certainly the monarchy.
Whether or not it is an accurate representation is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain that the schism in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a commendable figure who represented one side of that.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Killer pig mules Chinese farmer killed
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his surname Zhao Yun, was found in a blood-covered condition with a ruptured artery in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou, southern China, near the village on Sunday morning following a report.
A pig farmer at a hog farm in the Xining of Qinghai region of China on May 30, 2005 was preparing to give a vaccine injection to pigs.
He reportedly came from the Yunnan area with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and found the door to the neighbor's pigsty open.
He said that the big pig in the stall was with his mouth full of blood.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered, his cousin, referred to as his surname Wu, said, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yoon entering the market to feed his pigs at 4.40am on Thursday.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed him was not a male or a female.
When police gathered evidence from the scene, the market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were locked up to prevent anyone from attacking them.
Yoon's family and market authorities were found to be negotiating compensation for the death.
Although there are exceptions, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig stuffed a whale farmer into his tractor until his wife scared the beast away.
After eating an Oregon farmer by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can irritate them.
They are just playful.
They're nipples, very curious... they're not here to hurt you.
You should just respect them in the right way, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rainfall widely across the southwestern US.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes through Mexico's cold waters.
However, throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern US, rosa will bring flood-like rain in the coming days.
Rosa had 85 mph winds at 5 a.m., a category 1 hurricane on Sunday, Eastern Time, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eujenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
By then, the Pacific Ocean has begun to crater and move eastward toward the U.S. west coast. Rosa Baja will arrive on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm that will begin pushing deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to areas of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity will bring heavy rainfall across the South-West region in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause dangerous flooding conditions, waste flow and possibly desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause 2 to 3 inches of rainfall per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest region, especially in most of Arizona.
The sporadic nature of the tropical rainfall is likely to cause sudden floods with rapidly catastrophic conditions.
The advice to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain would be considered bad.
Heavy rainfall can cause rivers to flow through the valleys and storms will bring in local gale winds and blow up dust.
The arriving trophy will bring some local-grade heavy rainfall to the Southern California coast.
A cool half inch of rainfall is likely which can cause small streams of debris and narrow roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season area.
Some sporadic rain showers will begin to arrive in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in four corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
Throughout the U.S. some extreme temperature fluctuations may be seen in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in a short time.
The best example of a dramatic temperature change in the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is an approximate temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the delayed summer heat will try to rise and spread again.
Much of the central and western U.S. will see heat begin in October that will reach 80 degrees broadly from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a very high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing was watched by more than 20 million people.
Thursday's testimony on Brett Kavanaugh, who filed the nomination by the Supreme Court, and Christine Blaise, who accused her of sexually assaulting her in 1980, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Broadcasters, meanwhile, continued a political stand-off, interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turn on Friday: a deal drafted by Arizona Sen. Jack Flake will investigate charges for the FBI for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh caught her drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a hasty testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the air recorded by Nielsen.
The company had average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network which showed it.
And Nielsen usually had some trouble-measuring people who looked in offices.
To put it into perspective, the size of this audience was similar to a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
The Fox News channel whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment to the court, outperformed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was high after the hearing.
Flake was the man in the center in Friday's drama.
After the central Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught shouting at protesters by CNN and CBS cameras as he was heading to the elevator for a justice committee hearing on Friday morning.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as it was being produced, being broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power while many women are powerless".
Flack said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he had a lot to tell the committee that was hearing it.
When the entire Senate was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination by the Judiciary Committee for a vote, all cable and broadcast networks were covering hours of live broadcast.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats were requesting.
Flack was somewhat convinced by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Kuhn.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators after him, Flack made his decision.
Flack had the authority to choose because, it seemed, the Republic could not allow Kavanaugh to go without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British PM may accuse critics of "politics" over Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May may be accused of "playing politics with Britain's future" and ignoring national interest in return for a tick-or-toss accusation about her leaving the European Union in an interview with the Times newspaper.
Prime Minister Theresa May may attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29th September 2018.
In a follow-up interview to her interview on the front page of the newspaper, she attacked herself by telling her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson the Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that Britain and the EU's proposal to collect each other's tariffs was "completely illogical".
Ved Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect for the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson
Police arrested a 20-year-old basketball player, Ved Sims, at LSU for shooting a suspect to death.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims' glasses were lost during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Civizon, police said he confessed to fatally shooting Wade.
His bond was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Corner office issued a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head inside the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and citizens who helped in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Elewa, Athletic Director, LSU thanked the area law enforcement for continuing to exercise their duties and provide justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
Boughton grew up a 6-foot-6 forward at Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in shock" over Wade's death.
"You are always worried about this", said the Vedas.
A volcano blasts ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Risk Reduction Center on Saturday warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcano for 24 hours after activity intensified in the mouth and 183 gases and ash began to leak out.
The Centre was monitoring multiple noises and tremors.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash frozen on the airtight of a car in a neighborhood in Mexico City like Chokochimilco.
Geologists reported increasing activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independent vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined a revenge demonstration on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization over the split.
The group of masked people who supported the separatists, who were pushed back by riot police, threw eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that were usually crowded with tourists.
The crowd also dispersed later in the day after police used their batons to stop the clash.
For hours, anti-independence groups shouted "No pardon, no pardon" which was met by separatist protesters shouting "Leave Spain forever".
Fourteen people were treated for common injuries sustained during the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region even a year after the October 1 referendum, a referendum considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to be independent, however, fewer people voted as those who were opposed to partition largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured after police tried to stop voters at polling stations in all areas where violent clashes occurred last year.
Anti-independence groups pitched tents outside overnight on Friday to stop demonstrations in favour of the national police
There were demonstrations but they had to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote but now we are stuck, he said.
Despite special arrangements for regional elections last December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have struggled to sustain that mania this year as many of their well-known leaders have either gone into exile themselves or are in jail awaiting trial over their role in convening the referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests in favour of the police on his phone, said the riots were provoked by politicians from both parties.
It was getting more and more stressful, he said.
Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since the back end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to restore democratic values and denounce the repression we have faced from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car broke into house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Belanagrad Crescent.
Inspector Bob Bleming, who investigated, said the doors and building were also damaged.
A crossbow with a car can also catch fire at times.
Manga Strike gives Livingstone a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Mangala's first goal for Livingstone ensured victory
The excited Livingstone surprised Rangers as it was only the second defeat in Steven Gerrard's 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mangan's strike proved to be the difference between the two as Gray Holt's team advanced one level ahead of Hibernia in seconds.
Gerrards' side were far from winning this season of the Premiership and next Sunday they will face the leaders they are eight points behind.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
By then Livingstone will have continued their unbeaten run in the six-game division, with Holt yet to taste defeat after taking over from head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone will lose chances against visitors without an edge
Holt's team should have been way ahead before they scored, their directness troubling the Rangers all the way.
Scott Robinson was completely broken but continued his effort against the goal, after which only Alan Lithgow was able to lead his effort after sliding to meet Holcutt's header around the goal.
The hosts had the material to let the Rangers play against them, knowing they could get the visitors in trouble for being piece-like.
And so the important goal came.
The Rangers accepted a free-kick and Livingstone worked on the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson came together to arrange a megah that touched and scored from the middle of the box.
Up to that point, Rangers had held on to the position but the home defense was impeccable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had to do mostly nothing.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was forced to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's leg and a Livingstone player, Lithgow, who was lined up for the game, hit wide.
Livingston's box kept getting crossed and he kept coming out with two penalties for pushing away a handball after Halcott challenged substitute Glenn Middleton.
An analysis of "extraordinary" from Livingstone
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the playing field of Tony MacArthur
An extraordinary look and result by Livingstone.
For a man, they were amazing, expectations were starting to rise from him.
His style of play and players have changed little since he gave his best, but he is most credited for the way he has led the team since Holt arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett handled the beautifully arranged defense very well while the manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell constantly busy.
However, the rangers were less motivated.
They were good as long as they were under Gerard, they remained below his standards.
They missed the final ball - only once they opened the home team - and it was time to wake up for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles on faces and a brown sky on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They raised issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the opening of the new massive mosque.
It is the most populous city of Turkey outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
The thousands of protesters who opposed Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, both by Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to involve him in the country.
The dueling opposition portrayed the visitor's praise as a hero by some German Turks as divisive and his being vilified as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Road Crash: A cyclist died in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the south-east area of the city.
The driver of the car was standing and was examined by paramedics, but his man was pronounced dead at the scene.
The collision came a month after a second cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roads have been closed and buses have been diverted and motorists advised to avoid the routes.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officers were injured after rioting at a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.2
The break in order at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire occurred at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist tornado officers have been brought in to deal with the situation, including eight residents and a wing.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: Special trained prison personnel have been assigned to deal with the problem of MMMP long lattice.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and sent to jail for long periods of time.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most notorious criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And riot control officers were called to jail in October to deal with a serious unrest last year in which employees were attacked with pool balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, fears of sudden flooding over Salt Lake City due to Hurricane Rosa (drought-affected areas may benefit)
Tropical pressure rarely hits Arizona, but something similar is going to happen early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa makes its way across the southwestern desert, posing a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and western Arizona in Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, has already put out a watch for flash flooding for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to make a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only ten tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix have created storms or tensions!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZZ boundary.
Advanced National Hurricane Center models have predicted up to 6 inches of rainfall scattered along the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, with 2 to 4 inches.
Other desert areas in the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, have forecast rainfall of up to 4 inches with 1 to 2 inches scattered.
Out of the unexpected floods on which the risk is, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing as the region is suffering from drought.
While the floods are a matter of great concern, some of these rains are likely to be beneficial as the South West is facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second largest category, reported by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With maximum sustained winds of 85 mph with hurricane potential, Rosa was still 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico on Sunday morning and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is coming into contact with cold water in the Pacific and is therefore decreasing in intensity.
As such, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening at the speed of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall could occur throughout Mexico, posing a very high risk of flooding.
3 to 6 inches of cool rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, likely to increase to 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa then tracked northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning before moving through Arizona and then southward into Utah by Tuesday night.
Major damage from the Rosa or its remnants is expected from very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest, the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to bring life threatening flash floods as well as desert storms and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested in attempted murder
A 16-year-old man in Somerset has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man after he was found with a sharp weapon wound.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsom Norton at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Redstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials have requested anyone who has any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered, that is, the wrath of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh means rejecting the rigidity and abusive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh endured the "minus, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh was first tested before Congress on Thursday, with Christine Blais forcefully and emotionally denying the allegation made by Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a teenager.
Ford was also examined during the allegation hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that the American people showed brilliance and quality and courage of their own.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation is a vote for the most complete legal mind of our time, a jurist with a proven record of public service", he told a supportive crowd in West Virginia.
The President specifically referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as an important factor in turning Republicans in the midterm elections.
Five weeks away from the most important election of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running, he said.
That is why I am fighting for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the House on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, the senior GOP leader told CNN.
Thousands of people have died from Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, the number is still rising
At least 384 people have died when an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, leaving many stranded as large waves washed up on the coast, authorities said on Saturday.
When Paul arrived on the city beach on Friday evening, thousands of people had gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, and the waves had pushed some to their deaths and destroyed what came in their way.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake was followed by a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the coast and did not immediately flee and succumbed", Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come on its own, it stretched cars, logs, houses, everything in the ground it hit, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled at 800 kph (497 mph) across the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated and were kept in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, a pool has been bent and collapsed and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to shake after the earthquake on Saturday.
A series of earthquake tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in its statement that the energy released by Friday's devastating earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical situation of the city, which ends on the shores of a long narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the scaffolding of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that an additional 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the area 300 km (190 mi) off the northern coast of Palu known as Donggala, which is close to the epicentre of the earthquake, could have had more loss of life and property.
Communication systems in Donggala are completely broken, no information, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
This is already a disaster in itself, but it could get worse, he said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami in Palu, although officials said waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
Footage released on social media can be heard from the top floor of the building, shouting a dire warning of an approaching tsunami to people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and washes away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the instant footage.
The earthquake and tsunami released extensive force that disrupted communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military from Jakarta and other cities began sending cargo planes with relief supplies, officials said, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and items of basic necessities.
The airport in the city is open for relief operations only and will remain closed till October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo organized a visit to the relief centers.
Indonesia tsunami death toll reaches over 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision staff reached safely from Donggala to the city of Palu where staff were sheltered in Tadapatra's shelters in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
And they told me, saying, How many houses have they seen that are destroyed?
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups started disaster relief operations, Amuk complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers were also prevented from entering Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only come in if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Auliya Aryani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open up international aid, but it still isn't.
The night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami came on Paul, so the friends and families who were still missing were sitting around hoping for miracles to happen to their loved ones or for unrealistic stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the young boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the body of her mother who had been standing next to her for two days.
Jendon Subandone, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were brought from Indonesia earlier this month.
Among others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, those Mr. Mandagi included were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional load", he said.
Mr Gendon recalled how the news was reported to the paragliding community hours after the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed, who had sent WhatsApp messages to Palu Harifo who was attending the beach festival.
However, instead of two brown checks, only one grey check was seen in his message.
"I think it means the message didn't get through", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an ATM at Newport in Levi
Thieves stole $26,750 on Newport in Levy on Friday morning while Brink workers were filling ATMs, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car at the entertainment complex was emptying the ATM and preparing to fill in more money, Danish McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was busy, another man ran after a Zbrink employee and stole a bag for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police could not determine the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding his identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "Formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and used the moniker title for her eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday night's live show where she is set to launch her new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariane Grande on the show who had cancelled for emotional reasons, the show's creators said.
As well as being an acronym for his current occupation, West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him.
"I think that 'you' is a word that is used a lot in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year when discussing his album with radio host Big Boy Psy.
So, I am you, I am us, he is us.
He removed the Kenyan that had only one meaning, that only showed us our good, our bad, our mess everyone.
This album sheds more light on who we are.
He is one of a number of rappers who have changed their names.
Sin Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year released his preferred name as Love and Brother Love.
The previous West collaborator, Jay-Z, also did the hyphen with or without capital.
Mexico's AMLO has pledged not to use military force against any civilian.
President-elect of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the bloody vengeance against students.
Lopez Obrador at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday: "Never use the military to suppress Mexican people".
As the leftist student movement was taking root throughout Latin America, soldiers opened fire on protesters who were holding a peaceful demonstration at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at the time.
Lopez Orbador vowed to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving youth into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its AI funding.
The U.S. should double the amount of research done in that field as China becomes more proactive in artificial intelligence, says Kai-Fu Li, an investigator and AI practitioner who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after the announcement of AI by various parts of the US government, but also the lack of a formal AI strategy in the US.
By then, China had unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, and we look forward to further breakthroughs in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of the next major breakthrough in AI in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, invested in China's most important AI company, Face++.
He worked on an AI system that could beat America's top-ranked Othello player at Carnegie Mellon University in 1980, and then was an executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China division.
Lee welcomed technology competition such as the previous robotic challenge of the US government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next one would be, so as to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants, Lee said.
It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations, Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited brilliant people from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. increase its efforts in AI, Lee said.
I think that those who have PhD in AI should be given green cards automatically.
China's State Council released its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For NFS, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
By then, no action had been seen in U.S. law for months to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted on whether to rename their country the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that had prevented their bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims to be its northern neighbor. The name reflects its claim to its territory and was blocked by vetoes from its NATO and EU accession.
In June the two governments struck a deal on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the name change would diminish the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Celtic majority population.
President George Ivanov had said he would not vote in the referendum, raising doubts about whether the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum would be cast.
Question on the ballot reading for the referendum: Did you accept the agreement with Greece and gain membership of NATO and the EU?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zev, argued that it was worth the price to be paid for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, and to set an example in institutions like NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union because that means a safe life for all of us", said Oliveira Giorgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite not being legally binding, enough people in Parliament said they would stick to the result of the vote so that a decision could be reached.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 pm.
However, only 16 per cent of the population turned out to cast their ballots in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the total registered voters cast their ballots, compared to 34 per cent in the previous one.
"I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe", 62-year-old voter Gjos Tanevski said in the capital Skopje.
In Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their ballots in a referendum to rename the region of Macedonia, paving the way for it to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Karvadarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through service", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are rich.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can be like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zeev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think a large majority will be in favour of it because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zeev said after casting his vote.
He said that the results will ensure our future.
Polls released by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than needed.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed 57 percent of respondents on Sunday were considering voting.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
A referendum requires 50 percent plus one vote to be successful.
The failure of the referendum will blow up the pro-Western government's policy for the first time since it took over the government last May 2.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates the entire Brighton defence for a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England on Saturday in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero showed that he was laughably easy in his score in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders before hitting an open field goal.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He was driven around a defender before outrunning more times in the corner of the Brighton box.
After that, he passed to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero who used his right boot with a shot to the right of the right net to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero was experiencing some problems in his leg, city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
55, 60 minutes we talked about his game.
This has happened.
We were lucky to score him at that time".
But it was Sterling who benefited the Sky Blues in the early days of the Premier League scandal.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that game Aguero scored the ball in the Brighton Deep.
He sent the ball through the throw to Leroy Seyne beautifully with the left flank.
Seay made a few touches before leading Serling to the far post.
The Sky Blues sent the ball into the net just before it was taken out of the forward boundary.

wants to play a spoiler vs. a shazer. rookies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was no good reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Shazer is hoping for a round against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, even if only if it has a play-off effect for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have confirmed a wild-card spot with at least a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still struggling to lock up their first-class title.
Even if we're not playing to win anything, at least we can rubber toe it, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowds and other forces will probably play to the highest level of any encounter this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly busy letting Shazer pitch in such a situation.
Schäzer, who will make his 34th start, will give a bullpen session on Tuesday and pitch on his remaining regular Sundays.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
When the President was speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections, he made reference to the choice of Brett Kavanaugh of his Supreme Court for the surrounding situation.
Everything we did in November is at stake.
The most important decisions of our lifetime are five weeks away.
This is one of the many big ones, big -- I'm driving but I'm really driving so I'm fighting for the best candidate everywhere", he said.
Trump said, "You see a terrible, desperate group of Democrats, this is happening right now.
And they're committed to taking back power using whatever means, you see the pettyness and the dirt.
They don't know who they're really hurting, and who they're crushing to get power and control, which is why they want power and control, we're not giving them that".
Democrats are on a mission to "protest and create obstacles", he said.
And you see that in the last four days, he called the Democrats "angry and ugly and evil and lying".
He gave the Senate Judiciary Committee a rank of Democratic Sen. Diane addressed Feinstein, which received a standing ovation from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Yeah, yeah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a comprehensive church.
It is intolerable for those who speak their mind
It was hardly surprising when Momentum activists in my local party voted me out for denouncing.
And finally, I am the newest Labour MP, who is saying you are not welcome - all of us are saying it for our own good.
My parliamentary colleague, John Ryan, was treated like this because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censor board for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders because of the irony.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Like most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were the same.
Today, it is sad that this is not the tone of many meetings and the essence of kind, gentle politics has long been forgotten, although it has actually begun.
It is apparently clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate differences of opinion and each consultation is evaluated on the basis of its acceptability to the leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague with whom I had previously shared the same political views, they expect me to take a U-turn and take positions that I would never agree to, whether it be on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I give a speech in the General Assembly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - a bitter comment on social media is followed by calls to disqualify me, to reject the politics of the Centre, to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And my experience is not the same.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I am dedicated to the professionalism and determination of those professionals who face sexist and racist ideology every day but never feel ashamed.
The most frustrating aspect of this era of politics is how the level of oppression has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and with every "no confidence" motion or change in the rules of the election the party is getting narrower.
I have been advised many times in the last two years that I should focus on keeping my head down, not being so prissy and then I will be better.
But that is not what I came to do in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, irritated by the Thatcher government's neglect of my extensive schooling, I have sought support for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics in the last election.
Nottingham East could not be fooled in any way by my policy views, and disagreements with the current leadership.
I will say this to those who are promoting the proposal on Friday: as the country moves towards Brexit, it will harm our homes, businesses and our public services. I do not wish to waste time and energy in showing my loyalty to the Labour Party leaders.
But I have a message not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of election or political gain will stand in the way of my doing what I want to do and what is in the interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air goes to the top
Two delayed attempts may have greatly diminished the final result, but no doubt Ayer was also deserving of an unprecedented victory in this amazing tentership match of the day.
Now it's at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the decade.
In the end it was their excellent defense, as well as their better opportunity to take the lead, which was all the more reason to be pleased with the home team and coach Peter Murchie.
He said, "We have tested this in our game and we are unbeaten today, so I have to be happy".
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "The credit goes to Ayr, they took their chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, replaced by Frazier Klimo, put him on the airfront, but a yellow card for Scotland's Cape Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Marlowe to show the number and Jason Negot Bagot caught the unassailable attempt.
Klimo increased Ayre's lead with a penalty, scoring just before half-time and turning it into a solitary effort to make Ayre 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second attempt well and Patrick Ederson's attempt was converted by Bagot to reduce the independence to five points.
Rureidh Knott then suffered a serious injury, which led to a stretch and then a reboot, with a modified effort by Climo to push Stafford McDowell to the next level.
Air's acting captain Blair McPherson was then receiving a yellow-card, with Melrose paying an extra person at the end of a severe pressure run with an unruly Bruce Clowlvin.
Although the home-side came back and when Straw Hutchinson was given a yellow card for meeting Climo without a ball from the penalty line-out, McPherson touched the back of Adeir Maul.
Klimmo turned, Carc resumed it with a bang, and Kelly Rowe sent out Flanker Gregory Henry for a fifth attempt at the homer after collecting David Armstrong.
Even today, the game is still set to be a new career in the restaurant industry.
The Ford Kieran is ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was announced that he has been nominated as the director of a licensed restaurant.
Jack Jarvis, 56, stars in the popular BBC show, which he is writing and co-starring in with longtime co-comedian Greg Bumpfill.
The two have announced that the show will end with the ninth series and it seems that Kiran Craigleigh is planning for the afterlife.
According to the official record list, he is a director of Edriftmorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kieran wants to be involved in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The ocean is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes the Pacific will open its way to them again
A sailor patrols a large number of naval headquarters in La Paz.
A sky-colored flag is flown over public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, navigation sites are emblazoned with the slogan: "The sea is officially ours.
It is a duty to recover it".
The memory of a coastal land lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict is still burning - as the Pacific Ocean wants to be flooded once more.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Roberto Cailajilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said that there is a sense of unity and peace in Bolivia, and that there is definitely hope for a positive outcome.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICG's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will see in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of volatile debate - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit for Bolivia in the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's miraculous indigenous president - who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year - has several rides in the Monday regime.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, we took an oath at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely - and if it does, it will be a bit of a change.
The Netherlands-based UN has no power to hand over territory to Chile, and is determined that this will not determine the outcome of any potential talks.
Paz Zarrate, a Chilean expert in international law, said the ICJ's decision comes six months after the final argument was heard, indicating that the matter was not complicated.
Removing the last four years because of Bolivia might set this back.
The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zorte said.
He advised that Morales' aggressive statements had stripped Chile of any remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile may not stop talking about a coin, but after this it will be difficult to discuss.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Valtz, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring a unique opportunity for Bolivia to usher in a new era of a new relationship with Chile and for Chile to end 139 years of mutual differences with a consensus, he said.
Calzada also denied that Morales - still the most popular of Latin American presidents - used the maritime issue as a political platform.
Bolivia has never relinquished its right to access the Pacific Ocean, linking them.
The ruling party tries to see that they need to move beyond the past.
North Korea says that denuclearization will not happen unless it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ryeong Ho says that if he does not trust Washington, his country will not take the initiative to destroy its nuclear weapons.
Ri was addressing the joint general assembly on Saturday.
He called on them to implement the commitments made at a summit between the two leaders in Singapore.
The comments come as the US looks to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to resume more than three months of stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after Singapore.
Ri says it is a pipe dream, which will keep sanctions and US opposition unchecked and bring the North to its knees anytime it wants to end the Korean War.
Washington is wary of Pyongyang agreeing to the declaration without implementing the first major disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country sees as its only option for ensuring its security.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Parish fashion shows showcase the latest style of headwear on a large scale, keeping the high street at your fingertips.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or block out the sun completely, look no further.
Designer Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a series of unique wide headgear for their SS19 collection on the road, which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
High-needle hats have made Instagram buzz this summer and these designs under the catwalk have attracted attention right before their eyes.
A stand-out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top badge hat, decorated with a fan-like long brim that tilted the models' heads.
Other over-emphasized materials included turmeric ornaments, a gorgeous hat and pineapples - but they weren't designed to keep your head cool.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of odd masks - and only for Halloween time.
Many colored masks had sewn over the mouth and Howe looked more like Hannibal Lecter than Couture.
One construction was found to be accompanied by a snowball and black glasses with scuba diving gear, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And you publish a huge fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Fashion watchers speculate that the giant bonnets could make their way onto major roads.
The outer hat looks attractive on the high heels of Lala Bombay, with a two-foot-long brick-topped poal hat that has appeared on everyone from Rihanna to Leni Emily Ratajkowski.
The most widely circulated unrealistic hat on social media was a cult label behind it, sending a large design under the catwalk - a pool beach bag as big as a model wearing a swimsuit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, with a white leather handle on top of the cut cut with raffia fringing, was a stand-out piece in the Jacques La Riviera SS19 compilation at Parisian Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope big hats and beach bags will hit the high street next summer - because the designer has made such an impact that the demand for oversize accessories will be hard to ignore".
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence and have been consistent in 2018 with a set of excellent test results, only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is providing the highest standard of service to its students and carers.
The goal of Independent Schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and to maintain their position as global citizens.
As the education sector that shapes and integrates a school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages are continuing to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, he understands you.
If you speak in the language that touches their heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
As per the results of this year, languages are at the top of the league table with the highest pass rates among the independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign language have achieved the highest grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students have achieved this grade in Medellin, while 72% are German learners, 69% are French learners and 63% are Spanish learners.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages are being taken as subjects in independent school curricula and elsewhere along with STEM subjects.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey found that 17 percent of reasons given by employers for struggling to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are essential to prepare the vast majority of young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world with more potential employment opportunities for languages.
Whatever career they choose, if they have learned a second language, they will get real benefits from acquiring this kind of life skill.
Being able to communicate directly abroad will put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
A survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013 found that 75 per cent were unable to communicate adequately in a foreign language and that French is the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
This is why it is important for today's children to invest in language education.
Multilingualism, especially in developing economies, will provide children with the right opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language of instruction in schools will be different from the languages that are taught.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that will be considered the most important for the UK going forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, where teachers are experts.
Scottish independent schools are renowned for providing learning opportunities that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future.
In this age of global business, it cannot be denied that it is crucial for the future of the country and therefore it is reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer opportunities of interest, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
This must happen.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron in San Diego to start the Lakers on Sunday
The wait for fans to see LeBron James is almost over, as he makes his first start against the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
It would be greater than one and less than 48, Walton said on the official website of Lake.
Lakers spokesman Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
James was asked about his plans for the Lakers after training earlier this week for a six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need the Pre-Presence Games to prepare me at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's time for West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of campaign rallies in Wyoming, West Virginia, starting tonight.
The rally next week was the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies, which include a moratorium on friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to support the decision to fill Supreme Court vacancies, Trump is aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as he risks losing control to the Republican Congress when the vote is cast in November.
What is the time of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia train live stream on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to address a hearing this week of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained by sexual misconduct allegations during an FBI investigation that was held up by an anticipated Senate confirmation vote a week ago.
But the rally's main purpose behind the excitement is to help Republicans cope with the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign says the goal of this fifth rally next week is to activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the presidencies in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
A Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity that control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, as we are in a busy campaign period.
According to West Virginia Metro News, with plans for the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and coverage from Pittsburgh media.
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump has traveled to West Virginia on Saturday, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is behind in the election.
According to Reuters, Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said it was not a good sign for Morris to be trying to advance in the presidential election.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows willingness to hope to keep Sunday's singles alive
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's only four sets came to an end, which was probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum in motion is a perfectly innovative game concept, but a player who actually believes and then never does in competitions like this.
So he will say where is the speed now?
Because it's been going on all day, Jordan Speith said, "They had a six-figure lead and now it's down to four, so we're giving it a little bit of a boost".
Europe has definitely gained four points with twelve more points in the game.
As Speith says, Americans feel the wind is a little bit in their favor and they have a lot of incentives, not in the form of Speeth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day and each get three out of four points.
Speith kept the mould from T- to Green and is ahead with an example.
The cheering of the celebration grew louder as his round was underway, when A and Thomas were both down to two after, a crucial putting sinking to take the match to a four-square match.
The putt that gave them the win in the 15th match was met with similar shouts, which shows you that the US team is not out of this.
"You really just dug deep and worried about your match", Speith said.
Each of those players has now left this.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legend.
Europe's weird but adorable couple is four by four and can't make a mistake.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't get booed on Saturday afternoon, but they got booed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon after nine o'clock.
That run and the way his energy flows both sides of the frayed crowd, it seems, are the players who lose on Sunday, and there will be no more popular players for a potential European win, so sunset towards Fleetwood or Molinari than Lee Golf National.
Especially the two are together in different halls.
However, the European pride is ahead of its time.
When he was paired with Alex Noreen, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played the small part of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning charball.
Sweep the Spaniard and Swede into a hole with a bogey and two doubles on the front nine, in which he never gets close to climbing.
However, on Sundays there is no one to help you out of the hall.
It is very interesting to watch the foreball and the forum closely, because the dialogue between the couples does not take the advice they give and thus the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have performed better as a team, so far and have gained a significant lead on the final day, but the forum session shows that Team USA is willing to fight, which was questioning some of the special statistics.
Europe has taken a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
After exiting Saturday's foreball and taking a 10-6 lead over the United States, Europe will take a decent advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup in four matches.
Inspired duo Yomi Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two wins over Tiger Woods, who are so far struggling to take four points at Le Tiger National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side wants to save the trophy they lost at Hazelt a year ago and dominate the US team in football on the morning to take the series 3-1.
In the Forums, the US put up more resistance, winning two matches but they could not work in the losses.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to have four points live in a single match, after she and Molinari dubbed Molinwood, after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair to have four points live in their opening match in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, he had a great performance by beating Woods and American player Bryson Deshambo by a more powerful 5&4.
Woods, who saw himself in two matches on Saturday, showed an impressive burst of intelligence, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four-balls and forums.
Justin Rose rested for the morning fours. Dustin Johnson and Brooks came back to team mate Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 loss to Koepka - finishing first and third in the world.
This was not the case in Europe on a pleasant, sunny day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time presidential winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for Americans with double digits on Saturday.
He scored a spectacular 2&1 victory over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter in the foursomes and then beat them back by beating Poles and Rory McIlroy 4&3, losing two holes early in the foursomes.
Only two teams in Ryder Cup history have ever fought back after losing four straight in a single match, but the Fury need only pull to keep the trophy as holders.
After being second for two days, yet with a rebound on Sunday it looks like this will be beyond that.
North Korea said there was no way it would disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions in the United States had deepened his distrust, and there was no way the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ryong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Trade Organization that North Korea took important goodwill measures last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear test site and pledging non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any response from the US, he said.
Without any trust in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way we will disarm ourselves first unilaterally.
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, he felt that North Korea would be rewarded for making the right decisions gradually, saying that this does not directly rule out unilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
When Kim vowed to work towards "decentralization of the Korean Peninsula", Rhee released the first ever joint statement between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, the sitting US president and the leader of North Korea, in Singapore on June 12, and Trump pledged North Korea's security.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insisted on "disarmament first" and increased the level of sanctions and pressure to achieve its objective through a restrictive mechanism, even to the point of declaring an end to the war, he said.
The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a dream of those who ignore us.
But the reality is that the constant restrictions only deepen our distrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Highlighting three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in five months, the Minister said: "The party to this denuclearisation problem is South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill".
Even when he spoke to the U.N., Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from the year before. The General Assembly, which puts the U.S. mainland at the target of North Korean rockets, was essential after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened "total destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament at the United Nations this year, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is free of nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit, "If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking action.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The strict and unfailing enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue until we have complete, final, certified assurance that nuclear weapons have been destroyed".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea from 2006 to bid to raise funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that only North Korea had made progress in hours after denouncing him for his "criminal-like-demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action".
He said Kim told him he wanted "corresponding steps" to move forward on security and improve relations with Washington as promised by Trump in Singapore.
Harvard students scramble to get a break
This year's new class at Harvard University graduates are more than willing to fight the growing macho culture being studied by caffeine-filled "all-nighters".
When it comes to how to take care of themselves, the world's top university students find an educator to be a no-brainer.
Charles Kessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the curriculum, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start this course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Now, in my senior year, why am I being told this all by myself?"
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep until now - which surprised me, she told the Telegraph.
The course, which was implemented for the first time this year, will teach students how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance and enhance their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to start the course after students were found to be sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One section is a picture of a room in the student residence, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep timing.
In the second section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the complex with an interactive icon, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", added Professor Kessler.
He said that the culture of 'pulling the all-nighter' pride still exists, he said that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough good quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety - even for weight loss, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, causing them to feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, took a class of his during his first year at Harvard and helped Professor Kessler design a course.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired him for campus-wide courses.
The next step, they expect, will be to ask all these postgraduate students to complete the same study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Kessler recommended that students should be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting systems on sleep, as well as when to wake up, which can lead to sleep problems by disrupting your circadian rhythm from kills.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Manga Goal beats off Gerald's men by a single goal
Rangers faced another battle of the blues as a disgruntled side as Dolly Mangan's strike led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to enter their first win on the road since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gerrard's second defeat in his 18-game spell as manager of Gary Holt's side was left in his favour.
The manga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers didn't even have the motivation to balance.
Rangers finished sixth, while Livingston moved up to third and just behind Hibberly on goal difference.
Apparently being thrown an item from a distance can cause more trouble for rangers in the store after Lines Man banana spans are moved under treatment for a head injury.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side, which last year saw them reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with that Levi 11, who took a point from Hurt last week and was pleased with the way his well-drilled outfit breathed down his opponents at every stage.
The Rangers may have dominated but Livingston did a lot with the ball he had.
He needed just two minutes to get through when Mangala's first-half late-off Scott Pittman sent through the goal but the midfielder seized his big opportunity.
A deep cannon Jacob found after a free-kick to Captain Craig Hulket but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only extend into the back post.
Rangers were in control but looked more hopeful than they believed about their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos definitely felt he should have been penalized at fifteen minutes because he and Steven Lores had collided but referee Steven Thomason denied the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers used only two first half shots on target, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lasan's Coolibri's header and a weakened Ove Azaria strike.
While Livni's 34th-minute opener may have been the opposite of the game's run, no one can deny that he was worthy of his well-being alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to work with the deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Airfield did not react as Deacon Gallagher scored a ball on Scott Robinson, who kept his silence to pick up the manga for a smooth ending.
Gerard returned to work on the break as he swapped Cooleybelly for Ryan Kent and the winger's slot in the switch morlocks provided an almost immediate impact but the impressive Kelly was blocked from his line.
But Livingstone continued to play in a way that made them happy, scoring long balls high with Lithgow and Helket to keep the visitors glued.
Holt's side extended their lead in the final stages but Lithgow was well positioned to block Jacob before he came out of the corner.
Rangers were fined for replacing Glenn Middleton as he had messed with Jacobs but again saw Thomas away.
Panchang: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device called a Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, Geiger became a staple of counter pop culture as well as the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, in which he played the seemingly unlikely gay-pocketed scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the mineral's radioactivity.
Evans: Say, it sure pops!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to 'see' bad cells
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
As part of treatment, a vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, turning them into a lab.
Then they can see the 'normal' protein for many cancers and then inject it again.
A trial vaccine has shown promising results in many cancer patients.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells found that her uterine cancer had healed in 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, turning them into a laboratory so they can look at a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then reinserting the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor J. Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "increases the development of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer", Prof. Bernzowski explained.
His approach to teaching how to extract immune cells from patients and target cancer cells has worked in a form of leukemia therapy.
New West hit the pro-Trump dietrib wearing a mega hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West's hoodie was called into the studio after a thrilling performance praising her U.S. during Saturday Night Live. President Donald Trump and said she would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, "Ghost Town", in which he wore the Make America Great hat, he continued to fight Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often talk to an American person and they say, "How do you like Trump, is he racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
SNL debuted the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which Hollywood star Kristin Blasey Ford mocks Brett Cavannouadh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment charges.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's rent was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the posting.
Also, West complained to the audience that she had an uncomfortable time wearing her headgear.
They threatened me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out wearing that hat".
They molested me!
According to the Washington Examiner he said, and then he says I'm in a sunken place".
West is gone: "Do you want to see the sinking place?" He'll wear my Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to find love".
Her comments received at least two rounds of cheers from listeners and disappointed SLN members, Verity reported, with one person there telling the publication: "There was a loud banging in the whole studio".
West was brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Peripherary Bottle.
West was endorsed by TPUSA Group head Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing out from the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply "who she is and she's absolutely amazing".
But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing an ideology and speaking out against something that is harmful to my community.
It is independent.
So we are", she added.
Before the show, stating that she is now known as Kanye West, the rapper announced on Twitter that she had changed her name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg's name was Snoop Lion and the music legend Prince definitely changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist already known as Prince.
Attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after killing a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balihamkamur.
He is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is beaten up by a toxic man.
Kit Harrington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that young people feel they must be strong to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit states that he believes 'something has gone wrong' and questions how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Having recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Kit admitted that he feels too strongly about addressing the issue.
I feel, personally, very strongly at this moment - what have we done wrong with masculinity?
What are we teaching them as they grow up about the problem we want them to have?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is birth and what is it taught?
What is it that is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that this is a definite part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change it?
Because something is clearly wrong with the young men.'
He admitted in an interview that he won't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when it comes out next late summer, saying he's tired of battlefields and horses.
November Kit will star as the lead in Sam Shepard's return to True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, so she gave me my future family and my life here.'
Rose played Yegret, who is in love with Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the location of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China records 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through large parts of China as a result of infectious blood transfusions.
Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan Province that the number of people living with HIV had thus been reduced to almost zero.
Year-on-year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discouraged in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be intense.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many disease outbreaks are caused by inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised the universal use of HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied the employee had leaked GOP senator data, blasted 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. Maxison Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information of three Republican American senators on members' Wikipedia feeds.
The Los Angeles Democrat insists the claims were driven by "ultra-right-wing" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, and more hateful lies, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information transmitted includes home addresses and phone numbers for the U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, appeared online on Thursday.
Leaked after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pandit and RedStat report that IP addresses identifying the source of the post were linked to the voters' office and published information about a member of the voting staff, Hill said.
These baseless allegations are utter lies and a complete lie, Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
These baseless allegations are completely false and a complete lie.
Voters' statement prompted immediate online criticism, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This rejection is in anger", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she is unlikely to become a member of Congress.
They do not get angry when someone is accused of something they did not do.
They should not be defamed.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They must be quiet and pure".
Fleischer was comparing voters' reaction to criticism of Democrats by Johter Kavanaugh, who was accused by angry critics during a hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Nawara also took to Twitter to unite voters in the midterm elections.
"Big if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "alarmed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims".
We will ensure that the culprits are exposed, and "that they are held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to me and any member of any staff".
John's English Strikes Again review looked down on the Rowan Atkinson spy spoof.
It is now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new film with a British slant and that applies to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought to life again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Should we be self-deprecating about how we are the new opportunities of the country?
At no rate, the completely upturned, rubber-faced John English has a license to recreate anything a second time - though his signature name is more than anything that it is a broad comic composition designed for a non-English - cinematic field.
He is definitely a skilled secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretenses, has found some clues in the riots of the fire-themed tune at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, Mr. Bean's audacity and a doll of that boy.
It is based on the original traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson who once played a left-wing anarchist in a Barclays TV commercial.
There are one or two great moments in this latest JEE outing.
I loved Johnny English approaching the helicopter, when he was wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor blade was wrapped against his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor is rare and strangely unpretentious, especially as serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as their confident component.
It seems that this comedy is made for younger children rather than adults, and for me John English's naughty adventures aren't as exploratory and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
Now the best domestic support is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated a super-secret web network of British spies, exposing the identities of agents across Britain in the field, forcing the agent out of duty - an unfortunate minor role for Kevin Alden.
This is the final nail in the coffin for a Prime Minister who is a bold and embracing individual who is already painfully coping with political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a great job with this quisi-Theresa-May character but there is nothing special in the script to work with her.
Her secret advisers advised her that as every active spy had compromised she would have to bring someone out of retirement.
This means fighting Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school-master in a posh establishment, but how the off-the-records evidence of being an undercover operative is proving: Here are some good gauges, as the English spy rock type presents itself.
English is sent back to Whitefall for an immediate briefing and is reunited with his long-suffering former buff, played again by Ben Miller.
Buff is a married man, commanded on a submarine, playing a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicky Pepydine is a bit of a bum.
So Batman and Robin are back in action getting the very wrong things on Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Olga Kurylenko fighting off the beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Karishma is falling into the grip of a tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Boge begin their odyssey of farcical high jinks, disguised as a servant, they set fire to a flash game restaurant; they board and smuggle Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers sheer chaos as he tries a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the odds have been taken away for that final sequence, but as it is adequate and entertaining, kids' TV is very little about the whole thing.
Beautiful medium material.
And what happens to other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The worker refuses, he devises a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan in which Britons will work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company bosses to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees so that they can be given more days.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same amount of pay.
The idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favour of workers, sources said.
The Trades Union Congress has backed a four-day week to help workers take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits with the Party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party.'
The Green Party backed a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign, and the Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea.
However, this wish is not currently supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not being taken into account by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Council last week to push back against his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'faceless directors' and 'prophets' at utility companies.
Shareholders in water companies will not be able to recover their full stake as the Labour government may 'deduct' based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also endorsed plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds for employees to hold 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies, which stands to pocket with annual dividends of up to £500.
Linda Graham, John Kennedy speaks for 60 minutes on whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change his mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on the nomination by at least a week at the Supreme Court, and the bureau's findings raise the question of whether it can force any Republican senator to back it.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Sense. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, can the FBI find anything that will inspire him to change his mind?
Kennedy seemed more free-spirited than his counterpart from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course".
I said, I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And it came to pass when I called him, that he was displeased, and said, What hast thou done?
He was determined, determined and unrivaled.
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be set in stone.
My mind is about Brett Kwan and he's going to charge dynamite, he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And they could not verify all the names she had given.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is Global Citizens Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive line-up of performers and an equally impressive goal; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will draw thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy the acts of Mazzone Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was called in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to end poverty by actively increasing the number of people who fight against it.
To receive free tickets to the concert (unless you're willing to pay for VIP tickets), musicians had to complete a series of tasks, or "tasks", such as emailing a world leader, calling, or other meaningful means of helping raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free music program a realistic way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "eclecticism" - people believing they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, highlighting various goals.
He says these actions have inspired world leaders to announce more than $37 billion worth of pledges and policies to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations derived from its work, of which at least $10 billion has been distributed or funded.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Among some of the key commitments pledging $35 million in assistance to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens is The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and executives committed to "helping children grow to their full potential".
At a live music concert in London in April 2018, The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracy Ullman told the gathering, "With your support from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens alike, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history".
The group also said that after more than 5000 steps were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children across the UK, the government announced funding for a project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children suffering from malnutrition.
In response to a FAQ on his website, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and winding road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the acts featured in this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Russian could use US Navy for blockade to disrupt energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could use its navy if necessary to prevent clashes in Russian energy markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is taking place at the invitation of the ruling government - is a pretense to explore new energy markets.
They want the power of the middle-man, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe, and I think that's why they're in the Middle East.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States has the capability of our navy, and the sea route is open to blockade if necessary, to ensure its energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees at a ceremony organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that identifies itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and noted that they were almost identical.
He called Russia a "pony-riding" economy that is fiercely dependent on offshore oil, saying that "the economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to take advantage of the less-than-perfect and fuel alternative.
The statements come as the Trump administration is working to increase exports of its cheap liquefied natural gas, or LPG, to European customers instead of Russia.
To fulfill that wish, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, tried to pull Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, in which, according to Trump, Berlin has become a "hostage" of Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a fully economic project.
Russia argues that the USA's fierce opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we are of the opinion that energy can never be a tool to use pressure and that consumers have the right to choose suppliers".
Germany has not been swayed by the US stance and has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from European energy policy as well as the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said he was "very concerned" about third countries interfering with our energy supply.
Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren will take a "tough stance" in running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warne said on Saturday that she would take a "tough stance" in running for president after the midterm elections.
Warne confirmed at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts that he would host the Run for President.
According to The Hill newspaper, it's time for women to invade Washington and fix our broken government, and women are at the top of it.
After November 6, I will take a tough stance in running for President.
Warren rained on President Donald Trump during town hall, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am ashamed of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", said Zwarn.
Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been outspoken in their criticism of the war.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We had to have an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday found that most of Warren's candidates do not think War should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not take the step.
Thirty-two percent supported the move.
The poll found 38 percent in support and 48 percent in opposition to former Governor Deval Patrick, who was the most supportive of the run.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in the context of a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to an Associated Press report, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin cites PTSD from track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq in the Army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in a domestic violence case.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sarah told the audience about Donald, "What my own son is going through, what he's going through after he returns, I can understand the pain of the families of the soldiers who are suffering the consequences of PTSD and some of the soldiers who have returned injured".
Calling his arrest an "elephant in the room", Palin said of his son and other veterans returning from war, "They have changed, they return rooted, surprised to see what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military give the country in return for what they gave the country".
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday on charges of domestic violence, assaulting a woman from Wasilla, Alaska, and interfering with a domestic violence case, as well as possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
DCs from 18 states back challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying victims of gang or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a friend-of-court in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name is Grace V. The sessions suit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against Federal Policy has not been made public.
She was harassed by her partner and her violent gang member sons, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys from states supporting Grace wrote to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have led to a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as the country faces widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Police Board overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum against domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades-old state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided subject to certain facts and circumstances and such law violates that principle, the Fend-of-Court said in a statement.
Attorneys further argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry shocks the U.S. economy, which served to make their entrepreneurs and provide a "necessary labor supply".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to shelter victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11 saying that asylum is available to people who leave their homeland due to fear of leaving due to race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum did not mean eliminating all the problems, all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescue operations were intensified to search for survivors as the death toll in Palu doubled.
The situation was even more dire for the survivors.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish child at an evacuation centre in Palu, said, "There is a lot of tension".
Ambulance brings a body every minute.
There is a lack of clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up their belongings that had fallen into the water and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of injuries and a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Adhura, resulting in kidney failure in hospitals.
Dwyane Harris, one of the several wounded, had broken his back and shoulder and was resting outside Palu's Army Hospital as patients were being treated there due to frequent strong aftershocks.
He was moved to tears as he recalled those moments in his fifth floor hotel room, which was shaken by a massive earthquake with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to defend ourselves.
Harris, who was in town for a family wedding, told the Associated Press: "I felt like I was trapped under the rubble of the hotel.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was no voice.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' with 'propaganda AIDS'
A four-page ad in a state-run Chinese newspaper in the US cited the mutual benefits of US-China trade, a week after the announcement, the US ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the addition of an advert from the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper, China Daily - accusing it of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, which China denied.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US elections, US officials told Reuters, has now started a new phase of intensifying the US campaign to increase pressure on China.
It is common for foreign governments to resort to advertising to promote trade, but China and the US are currently in the middle of a trade war, and both have imposed new tariffs on each other's imports.
China's reactionary tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa and support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts say.
Terry Branstad, the longtime governor of China's top exporter of agricultural commodities, said China had lost American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now double-scaring us with propaganda ads in our own free press".
Branstad wrote that "to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's glorious tradition of free speech and freedom of expression to print paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register".
"In contrast, in the Chinese press world you will hear limited anti-trust voices and you will not see a true reflection of the dissenting opinion of the Chinese people on China's worrisome economic flow, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added, "A leading Chinese newspaper turned down an offer to publish his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts warn that defending Kavanaugh is upsetting women voters ahead of the Republican midterm elections
Standing with and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in a case of multiple sexual assault allegations, the analyst warns that the party will face resentment, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Sentiments around the issue have been extremely heavy, with most Republicans already saying they want to move forward with the referendum.
Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in an article in The Hill on Saturday that there was no turning back.
I don't believe that the last-minute push by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for an FBI investigation will appeal to angry voters, Rehr said.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow and they won't forget in November", Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group Movement, told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
"November is coming!" protesters shouted as they protested in the Senate hallway Friday morning, saying that Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee had advanced Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and inspiration of the Democrats has skyrocketed", nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
People say that enthusiasm is already there; and it is true.
But it can be more swinging, especially among female voters in smaller cities and younger voters aged 18-29 who don't vote often when they don't like the president".
Before Ford's public testimony detailed the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could come if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
According to Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, "This has become a puzzling conundrum for the GOP".
It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote on whether to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's about the way the Republicans handled the whole issue and the way they handled the prosecutor, Guy Cecil, director of Group Priorities USA, the group that elects Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the American people may be somewhat divided as they move further toward it following the Ford and Kavanaugh Accords.
The new poll from the National Crime Records Bureau found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely were with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Flake, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her when she was 17 years old, drunk.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his private parts to her at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web for Google and Facebook are planning to launch a new Internet
The team behind the invention of the World Wide Web is launching a startup to compete with Berners-Lee, Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from Technology Legend, Inert is a company that is building the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information to allow access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind the interrupt is "world domination".
We have to do it now, he said about the start-up.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include a contact list, to-do list, calendar, music library, and other personal and business tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify and is available on the same browser and everywhere at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who to give access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inert is to provide the company with the resources, process and right expertise to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently at the company, Burns-Lee has contracted some staff developers and volunteer coders from the security platform Bruce, which was purchased by IBM, to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inertip website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are "talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes to where all their business models just stood up overnight".
We don't need their permission for that.
In a post published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inert's "mission is to provide professional energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, Burns-Lee revolutionized the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a dominant voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even after the launch of Inert, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic for the next era of this web, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Celebration of the WW1 Victoria Cross cleric
The only church in England clergy who won the Victoria Cross in World War I and celebrated its 100 years in the city.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award in the attack on Belengaise and Lehcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and it was not known afterwards that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughn, said he was a "brilliant symbol", the monument will declare his grandfather's award-winning feat almost 100 years later.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Wayne led his battalion towards the Canal de Saint-Quentin amid "extremely heavy fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later reached the firing line and with "heavy bravery" advanced running alone with a field-gun and exited in three squads.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said that the work his grandfather did was "something I know I could never do but it makes me something humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after the parade, the parade was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wan said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the support given by so many is showing the bravery of a true hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Baller 206 instead of getting a Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night watching Pac-Baller 206 to refuse to watch the main event.
The San Jose Bill features 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, viewers in the UK were overwhelmed when Gagarde Mussi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other and coverage instead changed to Peppa Pig.
Some woke up early in the morning for a special fight and didn't know what was going to happen until they did.
A fan on Twitter called the children's cartoon a "sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, said "The government rule is that the content was not appropriate for 6pm so they had to go to children's programming.
Papa the Pig, "Yes".
Scott Cocker, chairman of the Ballet Company, said they would work on their schedule to engage UK viewers in the future.
I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably do that", Coker said.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning and we couldn't do this work in the same way as we did on Sunday and on Monday.
But we are working on it.
I have to say, when there was a switchover, there was a lot of text going back and forth and it didn't seem to be working.
We tried to fix it and we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I promise you that it will not happen again.
We're going to have five fights instead of six as we normally do and we tried to deliver more for the fans and we went from the top.
It's called a bad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'named' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he was humiliated by everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
Daly, 24, said he didn't realize "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on First Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about building "hope" for people about gay rights.
He also said that being a parent puts less emphasis on winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, has been out for several months due to illness.
Appearing as Castway on Laverne's first program, Daley said that she felt "more lacking than anyone" in him because "it's not socially acceptable to pick boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those who have experienced feelings of inferiority and feeling different have actually given me strength and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", so he didn't let anyone down when he found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for the abolition of homosexuality in more countries.
He said he spoke out because he considers himself lucky to have lived without solutions and he wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said she fell in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom she "suddenly caught up with" in a 2013 interview.
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her, but said that the age difference was never an issue.
When you go through so many ups and downs at such a young age - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer. He said it is hard to find a humble person who has had similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dale in June, and Dalle said it changed their "entire perspective" on life.
If you had asked me last year, 'I want to win a gold medal,' that was all.
You know what's bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011.
Daley said that his father had not accepted his death and finally said that if he still had tickets for London 2012 - he would like to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him that you can't sit in the queue wearing a bra, Dad, he said.
He became gassy and stopped breathing, and I sat there holding his hand. Dad died, and I finally accepted that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I realized that this was my lifelong dream - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games.
He also deliberately chose the Proud song by Heather Small for his first song, a song that served to tie the same at the Olympics and still thrills him.

Out of form for Michelson sitting on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil McLaren will set a record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unhappy milestone.
Michelson is going to play in the biennial event for a record 12th time, he was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's foursomes and foursomes.
Rather than being in the middle of the action, as it is done repeatedly for the United States, rather than being in the middle of the main action five times as he has repeatedly done for the United States, this five-time grand champion has divided his day between being among them as a cheerleader and focusing on his game and working towards what can be improved in his game.
The 48-year-old is not ideally suited to the tight Le Golf National Course when there are no perfectly straight drivers even at the peak of his career, where long rough courses regularly punish wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn't too rough, on Sunday in the ninth match, Michelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has paired up with Tokyo Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans are down four points in 12 singles matches, the race could be over before it even starts, so Michelson's match could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, except that he had nothing else to say.
"He understood his role today, he patted my back, wrapped his arms around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow", Fury said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to this team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine that he would play two matches.
I had more imagination, but we thought we should go on as we could.
He wants to live there just like everyone else".
Michelson will break Nick Faldo's record with Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
He could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the height of his personal record.
Although Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, Furyk said his presence has communicated some unseen strength to the team.
He is funny, he is sarcastic, he is witty, he likes to make fun of people and he is a noble person to be in the team room, he explained.
I think the youngest players can have fun with it, it was fun to watch this week.
He has a very special contribution to make, more than just playing".
Europe captain Thomas Bajorne knows that a big lead will be broken at any moment.
European captain Thomas Bajorn knows from experience that a huge lead until the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a setback.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where he was given a five-point lead over the Americans by side captain Save Ballesteros, but narrowly missed out on the final line by 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, even only then, Bijourn said, after watching the Class of 2018 win both Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all our team that time has not passed.
You'll be bored to death tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It is not over until you get points on the board.
Our goal and focus is to try and win this trophy.
I have told everyone that I am focused on the 12 players on our side, but on the other hand we also know well that there are great players in the world.
Bjorn adds that he is thrilled to see the way his players have performed on the Tough Golf Course: "I never put myself ahead of the curve.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
Tomorrow, a personal exhibition will come to work and it is a different matter to do it.
It's great with a partner when everything is going well, but when you have to show performance in person, your ability as a golfer is put to the test.
The only message you need to get to the players is that you have to give your best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and give him your best and your best".
Unlike Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk would expect better individual performance than his partner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four points from the rest of the players except for him.
Furyk himself has tasted both defeat and victory, Europe snapped the "Miracle at Medina" and was part of Brooklyn's winning team before coming out defeated in it.
Asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had handled his players on the final day in 1999, he said, "I remember every word".
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have to get off to a fast start like you saw in Medina, like you saw in Brooklyn.
When momentum is going in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in the matches in between.
Let's set up our line-up accordingly and put the players in a design that we think we can show some magic tomorrow".
Thomson is tasked with pushing the game forward and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Raheem, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter facing other Europeans in the top half order.
"I went into this group in this order because I feel like it covers everything", said Bieger of the Singles Selection.
Germany's new battleship is delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate, which was due to replace Cold War-era warships in 2014, was not due to be delivered until next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media said.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, a military spokesman said the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" brand has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the controversial post-delivery issue has put the future of the ambitious project on hold.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to have a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics are its long maintenance period - it should be able to lay new frigates from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays mean that cutting-edge warships should be able to show Germany's power abroad but will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The poorly designed F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to approve the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was said about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media cited some significant "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship unsuitable for a war mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class battleships would be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors, a manpower only half that of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, it also turns out that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is believed to be as heavy as the Edge-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project including crew training is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the initial cost of the project has increased from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problem of new frigates has become particularly important in light of recent warnings of a declining German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "going through a shortage of deployment-capable ships".
The official said the issue has been heated over time, as old vessels were scrapped, but no vessels were handed over.
He lamented that not a single Baden-Württemberg-class frigate was able to join the Navy.
The National Trust EventsDrops on the Secret Life of Bees
New research being conducted on real estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to explore how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will include common and soprano pipistrels as well as brown long-eared and dowbenton bats in the Invervey Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bats activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's sound and what species are doing.
A habitat map and report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Daver, a nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to better determine benefits such as grassland creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development works that damage their routes and habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials as well as attacks by pet cats also pose a risk.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a state-of-the-art eco-location technique to spot errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect resting places and occasionally carry out rescue operations.
The organisation also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve area at the Threeway Estate in Drumfrees and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is an ideal area for him.
Here at Thrive, we have developed a nice area for bats, he said.
We found old buildings, lots of old trees and very good habitats.
But there's still a lot about those bats that's still unknown, so what we're working on here and other properties will help us understand more about how to proceed".
He stressed the importance of bat screening before undertaking maintenance on the property as the potential unintended destruction of a single litter could lead to the extinction of 400 female and juvenile bats, possibly an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their roost.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged people to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and their many species, we don't even know how their population is growing".
Ronaldo denied the rape claims as lawyers sued the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape claims against him "fake news", with Ronaldo saying that people use his name to "promote themselves".
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, the magazine alleged.
In 2009, in a Las Vegas hotel room, Portugal and Juventus forward Ronaldo is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga.
He is accused of being paid $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the claim was reported, addressing Ronaldo's 14.2 million fans in an Instagram live video, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, not that.
What they printed today is fake news", five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo told the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
And that's common.
They want to be famous by printing my name, but this is part of the business.
I am happy and everything is fine", Ronaldo said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Mujib's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, a report they have called "inappropriate reporting of suspicions in the privacy space".
Lawyer Christian Schartese said the player will be compensated for the damage done to the moral image commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of individual rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an act against nature, according to papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good person" and only "one percent" a villain.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she even took photographs of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared reprisals" and "worried about being publicly humiliated".
Mayorga, 34, says she now wants to cancel the settlement as she is continually shocked by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse, and moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK 'will always regret' losing its status as a carmaker
If the UK loses its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, it will 'always regret it', Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "important" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Barnston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a no-deal Brexit event could be at the expense of jobs.
The Burnstone plant, which makes Toyota's Oris and Avenison, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
"I think we will see production at our factory shut down if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota at Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about the fear of leaving the EU, saying how cross-border businesses including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover will fare if they leave the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, carmakers say supply chain risk is a major concern.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis for car orders coming in from both the UK and the EU, with parts arriving from suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29th without a deal, there could be disruption at the border and, according to industry, this could cause parts shortages and delays.
The company said it was not possible to keep more than a day's worth of Toyota inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Checks Plan for future relations with the EU was "specifically designed to avoid checks at the border".
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "We need a deal. We want the best deal, with the success we currently have to seize this opportunity".
Evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers says that we need to be fully capable of maintaining a highly successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long the shutdown would be but with the production shutdown prolonged, he warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Sovelaris, who has worked in Barnston for 24 years and is a United Union convener at the plant, said his members' concerns were growing: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
"We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU", the government spokesperson said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be "delayed by another week" as a controversy over the nomination of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump supporters and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumor has been running in the streets of Washington for months about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and whether Mueller's freedom will be threatened as a result.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had wire-taped a conversation with Trump and discussed the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reportedly, to resign.
Instead of a meeting with Trump, it was announced on Thursday who would be at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't like" firing Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid friction with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that called for testimony from both Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of cavemanism and sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, with further delays in the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "It's not dated, it could be this week, I think it will be another week back when everything is settled with the Supreme Court.
We'll see though and I always prefer to keep the press informed".
Some journalists objected that Sanders had not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Anchor Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders said the reason for not doing the briefings was not to "rage" TV reporters, adding, "I don't disagree with the fact that they're upset".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
She said the current president has conducted more Q&A sessions than any previous president. She added without providing evidence: "We know the numbers".
Sanders said the briefing would still take place, but "if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it's many times better than talking to me".
We try to do that and we've done a lot in the last few weeks that you've seen and you can talk to the president of the United States when the press briefing is held".
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
However, press conferences alone are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have said why the reporters had assumed a strange situation and behaved recklessly before they gathered.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about fears of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff to express the nation's gratitude to staff working in Scotland's NHS and wishes they would remain post-Brexit.
The GAN Freeman MSP sent the letter less than six months after the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of implementing permanent status for EU citizens working in its dedicated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "During the summer, negotiations to leave the UK and the EU were underway and were moving towards an expected decision by this autumn.
But the UK government is also moving ahead in its preparation for a possible no-deal situation.
I know that this is a very uncomfortable time for all of us.
I would like to reiterate that I attach great importance to the contributions of every member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators from across the EU have contributed their valuable experience and expertise to strengthen the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Kristen Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after serious head injuries
According to a report by Tennessee Mike Organ, Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Kristen Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a severe head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
He pulled over and fell right there, Reed said.
Trainees and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type or extent of the injury have yet been released", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
This is the first season with Tennessee State since redshirt sophomore Abercrombie transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, adding up to 18 total tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay high stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty to buy property in the UK to help the homeless with extra cash under the new Tory plan using the extra cash.
The move could offset the success of Corbyn's drive to attract younger voters.
Stamp duty will be increased on people who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury expects it will be able to raise up to £120m a year in this way to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK with extra cash used to help the homeless, which Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to target younger voters with more affordable housing and higher earners.
To boost the government's campaign to tackle the extra money rough sleeper, an increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies not paying taxes in the UK.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which can include high level introduced on sale of second home and purchase two years ago and can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this to amount to up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers and those who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes at a time when Boris Johnson has called for a stamp duty reduction to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of squatting on land to keep property prices high, and Theresa May called for a drop in quotas on cheap homes to fix Britain's "housing disagreement".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a staggering series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and "no-fault" occupation evictions.
He wants to give more power to the committee to build new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means we have to fix the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not at all fair that buying a home is as easy for a hardworking UK resident as it is for individuals who do not live in the UK and work for overseas-based companies.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become rare and sleeping in a disrespectful rental home is becoming a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My final wish is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate wish" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, with three top-three points.
He disappeared from the stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father as a child, and that always holds me back.
The opportunity will only come if I succeed in the club management".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager have included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Caño.
The former Aloha Athletic boss says he doesn't find it embarrassing to follow such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'If I can get this club back in the Premier League, can I succeed at this moment?
The club has the infrastructure and facilities, which makes it undoubtedly a Premier League club", he said.
It's not an easy thing to get, but I'll only see myself successful here if I can get the club back there.
Ross has been in his management career for just three years, at Dumbarton he has worked 15 months as assistant boss and on the coaching staff of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa regain a three-tier reputation, and led St Mirren to the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He took up Eloah's case, saying, "It was probably a real life spell.
I really believed that management was more suited to me than playing.
It seems strange because I've made amends, lived a decent life out of it and enjoyed some decent motives.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to see a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through the pressure and burden of that work but the management seems quite right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I do it, it feels the most comfortable for me to do it myself in my entire lifetime".

The most suitable time for a pint is Saturday at 5.30 am, the survey said.
The summer heatwave has boosted earnings for Britain's struggling pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars groups recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but restaurants saw a 4.8 per cent decline in their revenue.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consultancy that compiled the figures, said: "England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup and the constant heat of the sun continued the pattern of the previous month of June in July, with pubs up 2.8 per cent, while restaurants took a harder hit.
The situation worsened in July after a decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June.
Drink-based pubs and bars did better business as sales declined as did restaurants.
Food-based pubs have also suffered heat losses, although not as heavy as restaurant operators.
This meant that people just wanted to go out for drinks.
Drink sales in operated pubs and bars were up 6.6 per cent month on month, while food sales were down three per cent".
Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM Paul Newman said: "These results are a trend we have been seeing continuously since the end of April.
The effects of weather and major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor market.
Not surprisingly, despite the ongoing struggle of restaurant groups, the ongoing 4.8 percent annual sales decline will leave a worse impact, especially on ongoing price pressures.
The long hot summer should not be a bad time for the food industry and only time will tell how much relief we will get from the moderate temperatures we are now experiencing in August".
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a slowdown in brand roll-outs.
Coffee Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector monitors industry sales and obtains and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a combined combined turnover of over 9 billion British pounds and is a benchmark of the established industry.
One in five children have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have a private social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, the survey found.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a "fake Instagram" page
The news has increased fears that it is posting sex-related material
20 percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have a private social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a fast-growing "fake Instagram" page - in reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that it is posting sex-related material.
20 percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents when they also have a second private account.
A mother saw her 13-year-old daughter's mysterious site go viral, with a teenager urging another to "rape" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of those holding a private account being over 50 per cent.
"Many teens are distracted by online places where parents and teachers can't find them", said Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC.
Eliud Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics Board
Elith Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for mentorship seekers to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Alidh is widely respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that Athletics Scotland will greatly benefit from him by bringing him on board.
Doyle said: "I look forward to serving as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to Scotland and guide the sport".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has four Olympic golds in total and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke on this day a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell how much I will recover.
It was a daunting task but a complete recovery came, I learned how to walk and today I exercise delirium!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Online opinion differs in breast pump advertising compared to mothers' cows
The breast pump company has shared online opinion with the ad and compared the milk care of cows to mothers.
To launch the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company LV released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad, in which the mother expresses freedom to show off the new pump.
Four real mothers dance on a track in a village strewn with cow dung on the street and sing songs: "Yes I give milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "Yes, you may not see the curls, it's my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump her, pump her, I'm feeding her children, pump her, pump her, I'm breastfeeding my women".
However, the ad on the firm's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
She conceived, and brought forth children, and she weaned them; and her children were taken from her, and her children were taken from her.
The Elvy breast pump fits perfectly inside the nursing bra (Elvy/Mother).
Another commented: "It's very traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't mothers who are breastfeeding their babies use breast pump ads?"
Another added: "This is an out of touch ad".
Defending the second ad, a woman admits she was inspired by the song "Hilarious".
I think this is a genius idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would need it.
Pumping makes me feel quite like a cow.
This is a bit of a crazy ad but it is what it is I see.
This is a genius product", wrote A.K.
Another commented: "This is an entertaining ad aimed at those who pump (often in their workplace or toilets) and have moms who look like cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with a sensible pump placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who breast pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvy pump, however, is quite silent, has no wires or tubes and fits perfectly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and even go outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Anna Banarin commented: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and aggressive launch.
By drawing parallels between expressing women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and all its challenges to the public's attention, and demonstrate in a fun and relaxing way that this new pump brings a wonderful sense of liberation.
This is not the first time that Elvi Pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two used the product to catwalk for designer Marta Jacoboski.
Hundreds of displaced children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
While the number of detained migrant children has increased, the proportion of monthly border crossings has not changed, as the harsh cuts and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with a sponsor.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear for their ability to stay in the country by going ahead and claiming those children.
In June, federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration officials, increasing the risk with the announcement.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confessed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor numerous citizens.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
About 80 percent of the sponsors or household members are living in the country illegally, and most of them have criminal connections.
So we continue to press the steps of those individuals", Albanes said.
To process children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, which previously, according to shelter workers, was 60 days.
Many immigration judges will meet via video conference call, rather than in person, to request their case for legal status.
Those deemed ineligible for relief will be disposed of expeditiously.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can result in violent clashes or escape attempts, according to reports emerging from shelter workers and the system in recent months.
Lawyers said concerns have been raised in a large facility like Tornillo, where children are more likely to be neglected due to the number of children.
She added that moving to a tent city without giving the children enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can be a shock to many who are already struggling.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw 'occupation forces' immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maoumeh also called for the return of Syrian refugees despite the country's eight-year war.
Mauleem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally occupying Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and "will be given fair trial".
They must return immediately and without any conditions, he told the Assembly.
Mouleim stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this religious war until we have cleared all Syrian territories of both terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence.
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly provide training and advice to Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the refugee problem, Mauleem said they had good conditions to return, and he accused some Western countries of "spreading irrational fear" that forced refugees to flee.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of these, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United Nations and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid for Syria will not be provided until a political agreement is reached to end the fighting between Assad and the rebels.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in one of the last strongholds of the rebels in Idlib presents an opportunity to push political negotiations forward.
A Russian-Turkish deal stopped a major potential attack by Russia-backed forces in Syria on a province, home to three million people.
However, Mouleim stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra fighters, who would be "displaced".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moulayem set out conditions for participating in the Syrian government's committee, which said the column's work should be limited enough to review the provisions of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will be able to win re-election in 2020 unless, and until, the scandal and scandal ends your presidency ahead of time, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
There is no doubt that it will be a dramatic presidential final like never before!"
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the president-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the prime-time audience for Fox News averages 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Meadows Show tops cable ratings with nearly 3.5 million viewers on prime news nights.
This is a fire that people are drawn to because it is not something we understand", said Neil Baer, who runs the ABC drama Dedicated, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Legislative Assembly building.

Unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the fate of RoV. Wade, whether displaced families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Being tuned is a luxury that can only be afforded to privileged viewers.
And yet, go beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock a row of experts discussing the effects of Bob Woodward's book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 shah-leather bomber jacket (a thick garment with hubris, the Washington Post says), and Mr. Trump's, um, Stormy Daniels's silly description of anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Everything he does as part of a reality show feels like he's feeding something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pony Stars, about the Trump show's changing cast and the daily turn-taking storyline (fighting with, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I got there this week, Mr. Flies was outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, the sun shining 80 degrees, but he was more than happy to watch MSNBC than CNN recording inside.
He couldn't shake himself, couldn't face Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance,
I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past few days and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' Mr. Flies told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but in the end they turned out to be true.

Outside money tight midterm election comes rushing into the House
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of wealth, thanks to a reorganization of congressional districts that put two incumbents in the race for a single seat.
These recently re-designated suburbs are Pittsburgh's district ahead of Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in the other district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is strongly aligned with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the old districts were run secularly in favor of Republicans.
The new 17th running of the race has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the main party's financial wing, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow margin in a widely-viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat retained a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a little more of an edge.
US imposed fines on El Salvador for cooperating with China, then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a stiff retreat from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team in 2017.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of US diplomatic missions due to current decisions by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama not to recognize Taiwan anymore, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only intended for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic cooperation.
The proposed penalties, which included deductions on financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials pushed back on a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity similar to last year's meeting that was seen as a step toward efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top management officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to go ahead, effectively ending any idea of sanctions for El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which will be convened by the administration in the import sign in mid-October.
And the three American ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House declined to comment on details of the discussion, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the management and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a book that is full of truth.
The shoe could then be placed on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has very solid evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his research to whether Mr. Trump's campaign collided with the Russian attack on the election.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that system as he prepares to go up again against voters and perhaps eventually a panchayat of his colleagues.
There are many possibilities, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or even that he's not in Europe.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, only if the West had stopped it and backed the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to prevent genocide in the years to come.
The course of history's foundations and the unbridled movement of democracy around such dividing points are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face some of these divisive points.
What if Mr. Trump expelled Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been beset by problems since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' account is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the FBI investigation that resulted from Brett Kavanaugh's new request is not complete or consensual - or if the Supreme Court upholds it despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress mediator who will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will last a long winter.
But I hope we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles on the Sabbath on that table with the swastika.

Ranger Graham Dorrance is optimistic ahead of the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria would put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League's G class, following an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented centre-fielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal in the season but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to even greater things.
It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side, the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the last minute, but a draw was probably a good result.
They were probably good in the first half and we came in the second half and were on a good side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a tough game as they had a good result in the last game but, with the support of the crowd with us, I am sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, all the things that happened like my injuries and the changes in the club itself are also a factor in what feels good for the venue now.
The group is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, put the past season behind us and succeed".

Although survey respondents had no idea how they wanted to be cared for, some people talked about it with their family members.
Almost half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they have talked to their children about it.
People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take steps to communicate", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
Where to start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family for caregiving if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance plan, a mixed cash-value semi life insurance plan to cover these costs, or a self-insurance plan with your own assets as long as you have the money.
Get your legal documents out of the way Get legal battles out of your head quickly.
Get a health care replacement so that you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to speak.
Also, consider having a power of attorney for your financial matters.
You would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are on their way to the hospital because of a medical emergency.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Keep a written plan of the details so that you can be prepared.
It's not just the money that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

The earthquakes and tsunamis that struck Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the communication outage, relief officials could not get any information from the Donggala region north of Palu, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about the Palu and Dongola affair, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a shoreline administered territory with a length of over 300 kilometres (180 mi) in the northeast of Sulawesi Island.
The administered territory, an administered area that is below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesian disaster mitigation agencies, Palu and Dongola have been damaged by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit West Dongla in 1996, claiming nine lives.
Indonesia is seismically located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is hit by regular earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the Asieh province of North Sumatra on the west coast of Indonesia on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people living along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom lived in Asieh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, just off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, giving rise to a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: Behind Sumatra, a magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai islands, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Assiyah Pd Jaya Governorate, causing damage and upheaval as people remember the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and trapped thousands of tourists temporarily.
Sara Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and obstructing an arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female colleague tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone away from her.
Palin is being questioned at a pre-match-su trial facility and held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he himself pleaded "definitely not guilty" when asked about his plea, the network noted.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused of crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sara Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, tampering with a domestic violence crime report and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident while intoxicated.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD she contracted from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake just hit back from central Sulawesi which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of the clash are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the shore, several hundred people gathered in the city of Palo to celebrate the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sefulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence never handed down in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Sipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot hired truck to attack a bike lane along a west side highway in lower Manhattan, knocking out pedestrians and cyclists in his path on Oct. 19.
According to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that the psychopath "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of those grounds provide for a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury reprimanded Saipov with a 22-count indictment including eight counts of murder with a dagga bat, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime prosecutions, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and foresight", the lawyers said, describing how Saipov behaved in a "disgusting, cruel and deprived" manner.
The notice of intent states, "Saifullo Habibullevich Psypov has caused injury and damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicholas Clavis, Ann Laurie Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendez and Alejandro Damián Panucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been nearly a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty trial to be held in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted and sentenced two years earlier on charges of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Psypov told officials that he was inspired to attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has requested not to plead guilty to the 22-count charge.
David Patten, one of the federal public defender lawyers representing Sipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
Patten said, "We think that demanding the death penalty rather than accepting a plea for life in prison without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved".
Saipov's defense had earlier asked lawyers not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vows to rally the people's army today during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had felt the heat from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bown, a conservative backbencher, said in Birmingham in March that if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have 'exited' by now.
But the challenge Ms May faces in regaining her deeply divided position is underscored by the pro-Remain Tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The president is struggling to maintain his checkers' plan of compromise amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would go ahead - despite strong negative reaction - by trying to negotiate with Brussels - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her support and "anarchy".
Mr. Boon said that the rally in Solihull was called for the removal of the 'Checkers'.
You suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If they were in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to get rid of the checks.'
Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight the world wars to remain followers.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bo rejected suggestions that the 2016 election had changed public opinion. The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.
Tory Brexit candidate Andrea Jenkins was also in the march, telling reporters: "I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checkers are not popular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, it is unpopular with our group and our activists who actually work in the streets and help us get elected in the first place.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers save their jobs when they deliver on your promises".
Shri Farage said rally politicians should feel the warmth if they are to cheat on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between our people and our political class", he said.
'They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you go after we have done it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
'We are assembling an army of the people of this country who gave us victory over Brexit and who will not give up until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, survivors marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour procession through the city centre.
A round of applause from activists after the group's launch this weekend saw the Tories' banners against Brexit fly.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked conservatives on a party app for the security problems he was concerned about as the convention opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can put the systems in place and all the technologies for Canada Plus Plus to have a frictionless border, so that there is free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
'It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to take a hard look at the presidential race
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will take a "tough look at running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about Tanaye's future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Jeff Deal, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has probably been at the center of speculation that she will go against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was Trump's 36th meeting with elements using the town hall format after taking office.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to heal our broken government, and that covers a woman at the top".
LSU's Sims arrested in shooting death
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyson Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He released a video asking for help to identify a man seen in the footage on Friday.
Sims, 20, shot and killed near South University Patangan early on Friday.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, per 247 Sports.
Wade came to his friend's rescue and Simpson was shot dead by Wade.
Simmons was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, being armed, and Wade admitted to shooting Simms.
Simmons was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 small forward who grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games with the Sims last season, earning 10 all-star points and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title by team orders against Sebastian Vettel
It became clear for the moment when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that Team Mangueval would play a big part in the Mercedes race.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry when he defended his spot in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton in traffic in the tail of the mass, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes later pitched a lap and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw a Ferrari driver unhappily leave the inside of the track free from the risk of being caught after a double-step to the defense at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid on his 21st birthday and finished seventh at the end of the first circle.
He then relied on his tyres for fourth, to set a fast finish and lead a large part of the race, going ahead of Kimi Raikkonen.
On the 44th lap he finally got into the pits, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps as Ryokan took fourth.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did an excellent job over the weekend and I was told by a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job to have a two", said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a parade on Saturday for insisting she had not cracked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a West Virginia rally, the president did not directly comment on Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that "what was going on in the Senate showed that people are selfish and evil and untruthful".
One thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see the people who are angry and selfish and bad and lying, he said.
When you see the leaks and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do this.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - oh oh where?
Oh, no. I was just...
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, it was linked to the senator's influence.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford in late July detailing the allegations against Kwanzaa, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his stuff, Finestone told the committee, Hill reported.
She told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret.
But she showed no reluctance to sit down with the president, who commented at a Saturday night rally: "What I'm telling you, that was very bad body language".
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing the defense of a Supreme Court nominee who was framed for sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to retake the necessary power anyway.
You can see the selfishness, the panic, they don't care who they are hurting, they have to run for power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars fought back in Dundee on Friday, winning 5-3 to compensate for an Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants.
The Giants were given a two-goal lead early with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bluvier's offense.
Dwyer restored the Giants' lead before Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought home a side-level.
Francois Bouchard equalised with Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen scored two goals to secure his victory.
Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season for the Men came on Friday night in Belfast to Dundee 2-1.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the parties, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came with the help of Kendall McFaul at 3:35 in the fourth minute, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Blueville doubled the lead after four minutes.
In the busy opening period Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 13:10 before becoming the provider to tie Matt Marquart Covey at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that when he scored his second goal late in the first night, the Giants took the lead at the first break.
The home side regrouped and once again Bouchard put it into a level term with a powerplay goal at 27:37.
At the end of the second session in the first match, Colney and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nelson to give Dundee the lead and secure victory by his team's fifth halfway in the final session.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are in their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies saving thousands from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after his death was confirmed after he successfully took off a plane full of thousands of people.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which prompted a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks could devastate the region and many are trapped under the seabed in Palu-Nagar.
After his associates fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunwan Agunge Mutiyaara was seriously injured at the Dolta control tower at Siss Al Jufri airbase.
He was busy ensuring that Batik Air Flight 6321 which was then on the runway could safely take off.
When he saw the control tower collapse, he jumped out.
Then she died in the hospital.
A spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia said Johannes Sirit said the decision could save thousands of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We had prepared helicopters to take them from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it before we reached Palu by helicopter this morning.
Our hearts are broken at this, saith Jehovah.
Meanwhile, officials expressed fears that the death toll could reach thousands, speaking to the country's disaster mitigation agency, saying the towns of Dongla, Siggi and Butong were out of reach.
Agency spokesperson Sutopo Puro Nugraha said that while many people are still not reached, it is believed that many bodies are still buried under the rubble.
Waves up to six meters high have destroyed Palu, which will have a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies.
Reesa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings a body in.
Clean water is rare.
Every minute a mini market is being robbed.
Jan Gelfendi, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors, but we don't know what to expect.
This is already a tragedy but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night so that the work related to the Nkrumah can be completed.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
In Indonesia, an earthquake struck Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea now says one person is missing after Laguna plane crash
A single-line operated flight that crashed in Micronesia's Pacific Lagoon is now being shown as missing, after all 47 passengers and crew were reportedly safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that the account was unavailable for the male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, the hospital and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit water as it attempted to land at Chuak Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and were in stable condition at the time.
Because the disaster has happened and the exact sequence of events is not yet known.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a runway lagoon short.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane would overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Janice said the plane had come down too low.
"This is a good thing", Janice said.
Janice said she and others managed to cross waist-deep water for emergency exit from the sinking plane.
The flight attendant was panicking and screaming, and she was also slightly injured.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors repairing on a nearby beach before the plane sank in water as deep as 30 meters (100 feet) also assisted in the rescue by using inflatable boats to rescue people.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but this does not include Air New Guinea.
An analysis of the night's timeline shows that the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday ruled on a reconsideration petition filed by a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used his cellphone records to piece together the activities of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she obtained location data from several cellphones, which refuted Tallis's earlier claims that Tallis was with her on the evening of Chamber's death.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers, he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if he was in the truck with Sanford that night, if Tallis was telling the truth, he said that he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Telles said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated that the couple had known each other for a week.
Shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted Chambers' text, call and contact information from her phone, Rowlett said.
He erased her from his life, Hal said.
His final arguments are scheduled to be heard on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped to take the prosecution before a jury later that day.
Upper caste: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge negative views of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The elite from Bristol claimed that the hip hop movement had moved away from its roots of political messaging and addressing communal issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-populate conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK through acts like Akala and Loki.
Another black guy?!
NY nanny accuses couple after racist text
After receiving an inappropriate text saying "He was another black person", the mother complained, suing a New York nanny couple for discriminatory dismissal.
The couple denied being racist, comparing the claim to a "money laundering" scheme.
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed to find new babysitter Giselle Morris unconscious on her first day on the job in 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON, said Mrs. Plasco-Flexman had texted her husband.
However, she sent a virgin Morris twice instead of her husband.
According to the New York Post, an "uncomfortable" Placebo-Flexman fired Ms. Morris after realizing her mistake, saying that the current nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she expected a Filipino to replace her.
Kumari Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Now, Morris is suing for damages to fire the couple, and is seeking $350 a day for six months, initially hired for residential work, but without a retainer.
I want to show you that, look, you can't do that", she told the post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
Responding to claims that the couple were racist, he said it was right to terminate Morris' employment, fearing they could not trust him after insulting him.
My wife sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, "President Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your child with someone you thought was wrong, even if you were wrong?
What about your newborn baby?
Let go".
Comparing the campaign to a money-collection campaign, Plasco said his wife was months away from having a baby and was going through a very difficult time.
You go after someone, like that?
This is not a good thing, the investment banker said.
Although the legal process is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has responded quickly condemning the couple's behavior and logic for condemning the couple on social media.
Paddington's publishers feared that the reader would not associate with a talking bear, a new letter published in the paper said.
Bond's daughter Karen Janckel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to keep a first-time reader in the background before publishing.
We now know that this is a very surprising development in the context of Paddington's great success".
Says that her father, who was inspired to write a children's book by a small toy bear, had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, and joked about quitting his job, telling her that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was Bittersweet, after he died last year.
Paddington, who she calls an important member of her family, said her father was proud of her potential success.
He was a very quiet person, and he wasn't a self-righteous person, she said.
But because Paddington wasn't very real to them, it was like if you have a child who accomplishes something: you feel proud of it, even if it's not actually doing your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his own invention and imagination, he always credited Paddington with it".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon discharging his daughter, he was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to show her life.
Ned always called to say that this was really bad, because he didn't expect it to succeed, Ms. Eden-Laperoussais said.
Then I got a call from Ned that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
You will be with me soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors gave her medication for her heart pumping, which was slowly losing effect and leaving her system.
She had recently passed away and it was all over.
Even though I knew all this, I just had to sit there and wait for it.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I actually had to handle this".
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Lapperhouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - unaware of the psychological anguish she was enduring.
No one knew, she said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to believe, but it was on that flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy for Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Victim women post-card to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are posting an inspiring message and phone number on a card at the Northwell Bridge that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old, from which he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parents to have to experience what I feel every day, she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, told them that her son was a promising cook with a prominent smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
He always said that his memory would light up any room".
However, before his death, he was left in "a place of deep shadow".
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler's brother was looking for his brother who committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there is going to be a knock on effect".
Mrs. Davis held up a card, "to show people that there are many people they can go to and talk to", even if they are not friends.
Don't sit silently - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphries, who has been a lover of Mrs. Davis for years, said that shortly after Mark's mother died, she lost her partner of 15 years, Mark.
Never told her she was feeling sad or depressed or anything, she said.
A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his disposition.
He was so devastated on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at you or anything".
Her death was a big shock for him, but he has to work on it: "It leaves a hole in the family.
This is what separates us.
But we all have to keep fighting".

The future of Kwanzaa hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
He said, "I thought we could actually get what he wanted - a limited time of research, limited scope - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, expressing concern that the committee was biased and stuck in a gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kwanug and his Republican supporters not like the FBI investigation?
They have a desire because of the time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as is hoped, the Republicans do poorly, they will be hampered in their effort to pick the man they want on the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was calling the senators, he was following them to support Mr. Kwanug, who had driven to the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its own report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kwanugua will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor to secure Mike Pence's tie-breaking approval to become vice president for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea decreased under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-seok, Minister of Integration of the South, cited the figures and said that there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high fees accepted by people smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of refugees from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The largest number of escapees came through China, which shares the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross between the two Koreas in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) of high security.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants who are not accepted as refugees, and repeatedly forcibly returns you.
The North-South relationship - still technically at war - has improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, with the topic of deferred nuclear disarmament at the heart.
This followed a historic meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June, when they broadly agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Mr. Ri, in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, said that without any trust in America, our national security will not be trusted, and in such situations, there is no way that we can disarm ourselves unilaterally first.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court by nature.
Pelosi made the comments at an event at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had ever demonstrated like this, they would have said 'historical,'" Pelosi said Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her reaction to Kwannaugh's testimony.
Kwanuaghe emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blessley Ford while they were both in their virginity.
Discussing his family and high school, Kwanuag was very emotional during his initial statements, often speaking almost loudly and choking.
He condemned Democrats on the committee for clearly justifying the accusation of "violent and coordinated character assassination" planned by liberals, which led to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kwanzaa's testimony proves she is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, as it makes clear she is biased against Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself, with the statements and the style in which he followed Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kwanzaa if confirmed and if Democrats managed to win a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi expressed skepticism.
"I will do this", Pelosi said, "if they are not showing Congress or the FBI the reality, they are not worthy of being on the Supreme Court, not just the judiciary".
Kwanuagh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential lawsuit against the Due Process Act or Roe v. Wade because it comes in a conservative justice man.
At his confirmation hearing, Kwanukwaa ignored the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
Pelosi said this is not the time to go to court for hysterical, biased arguments, and hopes Amara will say this will not go well.
And women need to do this.
It is a fitting commentary on months and years of anger that she cannot get out of it without a roar.
We cry when we're angry, Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a worker somewhere, who said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique, which meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person in front of her, who was talking to her, 'You think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm angry".
And she just keeps moving on.
And I think that was reasonable".
Tears are allowed as an outlet of anger because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with unspeakable anger, was that I was grabbed by a woman with a scar on my neck - a sharp manager, whom I had always been a little afraid of - who dragged me up a ladder.
Never let them see you cry, she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
He is glad to see you in your sorrow and to be near you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was the chairwoman of a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart to run for his own presidency.
When Mr. Hart was caught in a botched affair in 1987 called Monkey Business and was eliminated from the competition, Ms. Schroeder was very disappointed and felt that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
Thirty years later, she tells me with a smile that it wasn't a well-thought-out decision.
There were already seven participants in the competition and the last thing they wanted was another one.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was already delayed, she was behind the fundraising, and that's why she vowed not to participate in the contest until she had raised $2 million.
This was a losing battle.
She learned that some supporters, who had given the men $1,000, would only give her $250.
Did they think I was getting a discount? She was surprised.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run a formal campaign, she was overcome with emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it hard to raise money, and anger at voters and gender bias in place of representatives - that got her caught up.
"You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You may have thought that Clenx was my professional sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
She cried?""
How the US-China trade war may be right for Beijing
Experts believe that the initial phase of the US-China trade war has been dire, and that the long-term benefits for Beijing could increase until the war is over.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week was with the imposition of a half-cent tax on all goods entering the US from China, affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods.
Beijing has retaliated each time, imposing tariffs of between five and 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised a short-for-short match with the US, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to catch up anytime soon.
To turn back to Washington would mean to bow to the Mandate, but to bow publicly to the United States would be deeply embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing makes its move properly, the pressure of the US trade war could positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact is that Washington or Beijing can make a snap political decision that could trigger a situation that is economically tailspin, or actually more dire than what previous observers in the country have seen", said Abigail Grace, a research associate, who looks at Asia for the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to send refugees back
Syria says it is willing to voluntarily return refugees, and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the situation in the country is improving.
He said that today the ground situation is more stable and secure to move forward in countering terrorism.
The Government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The country now has all the conditions for voluntary repatriation of refugees who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alim said the Syrian administration would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or support from countries that sponsor extremism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team America at Le Golf National outside Paris, France with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The U.S. has now lost six straight times on the European continent and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown, as Denmark captain Thomas Bjorn's teenage reached 14.5 points, defeating the United Nations he needed.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for much of the tournament, dipped his T-shirt in the water at the 16th hole par-3 and won his match against Francesco Molinari.
Since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979, Italian golfer Molinari has shone in all of his trips, with 1 of 4 players going 5-0-0 ahead.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out of the 5&4 by Denmark's Thorbjørn Oles, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European winner of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry but today I am alive.
This has been a tough year.
So I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting in me.
I am very happy to get the cup back.
Emotionally moved by the European win, Garcia said, "This is about the team and I am happy that I was able to help.
He takes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud, I grew up watching the man beat Tiger Woods", said Rahm, 23.
In France, Woods lost all four of his matches and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
The odd figure of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, came second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has struggled to get fairway all weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, these guys fought.
It was this morning when we poured some warmth over Europe.
We fought.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is the best captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll all be together once again, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move forward.
I am very fond of these 12 players and proud to serve them as captain.
You have to take off the top of your hat.
We got out".
