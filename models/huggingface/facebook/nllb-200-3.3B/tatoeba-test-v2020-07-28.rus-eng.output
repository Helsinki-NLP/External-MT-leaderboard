Do your children know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup is fishy.
There are a lot of girls in the room.
He talks about her too much.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Didn't you know that I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in what was, from the Jews' point of view, a terrible Galilee dialect of Aramaic instead of Hebrew, thus showing the inconsistency of claims about the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in prayer brings one especially close to God.
Tom changed his mind eventually.
My opinion differs slightly from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
Tom was paid three hundred dollars for this.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast was right.

And I'm very pleased to meet you.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
There's nothing I can do to help Tom.
Is that my book?
Laundry is routine.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's children must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's studying physics at Oxford.
He kept that fact from me.
You saved me?

Tell Tom to be here by half past three.
It's not God knows what science.
Tom suspected Mary of using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it will rain.
You want a beer?

How great is that?
I have a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car sells well.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom should have done.
Tell her I said hi.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer shocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?

Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore this.

Eating meat is bad for your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to say a few words for me.
No one likes me.
I wish I knew Tom's number.

The teacher wrote a short comment on each sheet.
You're hard to take seriously.
Members of this tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix this
I said let them go.
When does it start?
Nobody cares what she thinks.
It doesn't seem strange to me.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it to me".
When will you harvest the wheat?
Tom told Mary that he was ready to do that.
Is there any point in fixing it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried to do that three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight in the morning.
We can try.

It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find Tom.

What would you do?
He disappeared into the crowd.
Don't you see what's happening?
I'm so glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?

Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This is a lesson that never ends!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets everything because he's an asshole.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It looked like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
That's not likely to happen.
I'll order that later.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was free all day, and today I'm working.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
Come to think of it, I really need a cell phone.
You must be patient.

I don't see the problem.
I don't have to do that tomorrow.

She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the back of the auditorium.
You will survive.
What did she buy at that store?
When are we gonna have a woman president?

I was very calm.
We all have something to hide.

Time is a good thing.

What's the weather like?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Aren't you going to introduce me?

You're both idiots.
Do you like living in the country?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the manager of Tom.
Who are you planning on going to Australia with?

Which one is better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!

I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.

Run, you chicks!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You've got me going!
I think we should pay more attention to the way things are.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until after two in the morning.
Mary did not feel thirsty.
Tom didn't find it as hard to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we were late because of the heavy rain.
She seems to be in good health.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Watch your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to end.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturdays?
I put milk in the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom is winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know that Tom can draw.
They're all dirty.
I didn't know it was impossible to do that.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Did it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You won't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?

How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a puzzle.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His grey eyes were sparkling and sparkling, and his usually pale face was alive and covered with a blush.
What kind of pizza do you like best?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Have another.
I'm looking for my passport. Have you seen it?
His hands are blue from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was doomed to die.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Can anyone here speak French?
I think Tom is still living in Boston.
Let me take your bags.
Besides, I don't know how to dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Tom is in charge.
I learned to practice and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than they like to learn.
He was mistaken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary is in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of the fight.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's move!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom isn't used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Has the mustache suddenly become fashionable?
Said he wouldn't want Tom to spend so much time on it.
You are upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom is wearing a pirate costume.
That's the truth!
Let's get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
My work is my passion.
Why didn't you ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out.
We're proud of what we've accomplished.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald the Blue-toothed, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
It's been very hot these last few days.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Tom never saw Mary again after that.
You can't go in this room.
You had other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her one more time.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
To tell you the truth, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When a criminal case comes to court, it is customary for the jury to be twelve.

Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
Another day has passed.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go for an x-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He hurt himself when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, hurry up! We're going to be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world-renowned for its hamburgers.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like this perfume?
The lock is broken.
A diamond is a precious stone.
Have some of that cake, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to go to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How was your sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's going to be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice encountered, as she waited for an answer, was a sudden howl, a roar so sharp as to break her eardrums, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary carry things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He'll take what he can get.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana cake?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed up the tree.
The language I'm learning is very complex.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president's been in office for four years.
I'm glad you are.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have on you?
Could you solve this problem?
Tom and Mary are both here.
Why would Tom do that?
In a building of 20 floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you hold on a second?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not firing him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind came up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as a mule.
I think you're a man to be reckoned with.
She knew she was wrong.
This is so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom talked in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl answered the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom that you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing the mayonnaise with the ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom has small eyebrows.
Did you understand what she said?
You're a little distracted.
Don't mess with her.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place secure?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything is okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't go on the wrong side of the road.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're finished.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept to him; he always had enough to eat.
The theater needs new curtains.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
I was poisoned.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
He looks like he's sleeping.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her feet were sore.
That's a risk we can't afford to take.
I have something important to discuss with you.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you were jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do this again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also kind to the animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Tom moved away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't stop thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
We cried together.
You want to try it again?
Just give it a little more time.
Why are you so naked?
Milk can be used to make butter, cheese, and many other things.
You don't have the authority.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink the water, remember the men who dug the well.
Did you know that Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, right?
You are drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary are John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked in response.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll get there if you try.
Did you ever think of asking Tom for help?
It's worth a shot.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one was hungry but me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in an avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's time to spit.
I really liked this book.
You are important.
When ice melts, it turns to water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay the night.
Tom didn't tell the policeman his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was in pain.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is that gonna hurt?
The girl was wearing a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who should Tom play with?
I need a light coat.
I finished my assignment.
It's the cat.

I just got out of the shower.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary aren't married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We are champions.
Tom is a snot.
Tom said that wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?

I already talked to that student.
What's the chemical symbol for hydrobromic acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.

I think you should do it.
That's cool!
Don't you want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a janitor.
I respect his views, even though I don't agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after 9:00?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using it, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
How long are you planning on staying?
We ate in a hurry and left right away.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You are stubborn.
Be careful not to drop anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The lock was open.
I blame the prince.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day of school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's pretty too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?

The apples are big.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about that.
Does she sing?
I have to go to the bathroom.

A good coach coaches this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was delayed because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I am a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It had to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Is that where you live?
What would you like to eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do that or not.
I'm going down.
I was unable to come to his birthday party.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
She learned to ride a bike last year.
Help us out here.
You don't have to thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
"How are you, Mike?" "My name is Tom".

This coat is unfashionable.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married at the time.
I bought this book.
Naivety is his only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom lived in Boston as a kid.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he says, don't believe him.
I went further.

I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies are put to sleep under the cradle.

It's amazing how quiet it gets when it snows.
Tom is helping his wife.
It's in her room.
I didn't think you'd be back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do this.
My mother was against me going alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
You know what you're doing, don't you?
You can't trust a machine translation.
She hit me, not him.
You wouldn't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There are plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing short of a miracle.
She's the same age as me.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows that what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a mild climate.
Check again.
Do not judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced an injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'll go to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom is only pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion about taxes.
Tom is watching.
The rain has stopped. We can open the windows again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom got lost.
I was about to leave when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with this.
Always give way to the obstruction on the right.
We're being asked to take turns.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Are you still having trouble with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing like a hot bath to relax you.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
Sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to be sorry about.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a siren's song to me.
How's it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.

Is the thomas big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making that noise.
I have a stomachache.
You know how busy I've been?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a big fan of Sex and the City.
You're not that patient.
You said you wanted this.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to borrow my car tomorrow.
Do you have to do this a lot?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For the love of God, stop!
Nothing like a glass of beer after a long day's work.
What's the matter?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will you need?
Let's just take a breath here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want to.

We know about it.
You could have helped us.

"Who is this Norman Finkelstein?"
Get out of here!
So what is it, I wonder, if it's not selling stuff at home, maybe it's a new way to meet girls?
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you clean your room?
If there is no God, then everything is permitted.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I should have married him.
Are you still at work?
What's new?

I didn't see you.
You're just stating the obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the one who made this happen.
He's as accurate as a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're just taking things for granted.
Let's move it.
Let's leave that for tomorrow.
Tom may know more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.

Do you believe in soul mates?
What's all that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
This is disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is a good offense.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the seizure of computer records from a man in the German city of Magdeburg.
How are you?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We were driving back through Boston.
Who's going to believe that?
Thank you for correcting me.
Are you out of your mind?
The stars come out at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom is sharpening his pencil.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike.

Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.

I'm having a rough day.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom didn't learn to drive until he was thirty.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pen knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon be accustomed to the country life.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
The river is the deepest.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they should be written together is a big problem in Norwegian.

He deals in cars.
You still keep in touch with her?
"Do you think he will come?" "I hope not".

How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship has remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get down to business.
Tom sat on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning strikes twice in the same place.
I'm not bragging about it.
Save it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for the death of John.
You decide.
Were you surprised?
We counted the rings of years on the tree we cut down, and we determined that it was thirty years old.
I feel like I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom to never write to my daughter again.
The rabbits are multiplying rapidly.

Tell me the truth.
I'll be there, no matter what.

I'd like to go back to Tokyo by way of Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't already know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom was the last one to leave.
Tom signed the petition.
Have you tried talking to Tom about that?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
I see now.
Give me some time.
You want them to help?
Tom is nowhere to be seen.
I'm the one who told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
In the near future, we may meet again.
The trees calmed me down.
He is a bumblebee.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me in the loop.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Mary told me she would buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two forty-five-cent stamps, please.
I'll give you a bike for your birthday.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think Tom will like that.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said she was yours.
Tom is busy with his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced from my husband.
This is extremely interesting.
Don't stay up too late.
That's what we're working on.
Having fun?
Tom is watching figure skating on TV.
We'll have to sleep outside tonight.
Did Tom show Mary how to do that?
Isn't that wonderful?
I've got a rash.
The school is only five minutes away.
Tom put the spoon in his pocket.
Is that all you care about?
Do you see a rose?
Mary tried to hide her tears.
Self-confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.

I baked these cookies for them.
You're twisting my words.
Let's go back to lesson three.
Tom is not often at home.
I hope you're feeling at home.
I'm still waiting.
This soup is very good, isn't it?
A huge crowd of people were waiting.
There's a bottle in the fridge.
I still can't believe that Tom hates Mary.
Tom didn't say when he'd be here.
Tom likes you very much.
Can you do that for me?
There's a little something I can do for you now.
I'm here because I was asked to come.
A man was seen acting suspiciously shortly before the explosion.
He sits cross-legged.
I definitely heard a scream.
There are many foreign tourists in Asakusa.
I wrote this for Tom.
You're not married?
Tom must have been drunk.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
He's not richer than me.
If only I could tell you!
She missed her train.
I go to the sea in summer and to the mountains in winter.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
You know everything about me.
The old man lives alone.
You are so stupid.
He's hardly ever mad.
You look tense.
I don't know how to do that.
What would make you happy?
I'll be there on Monday, Tom on Tuesday, and Mary on Wednesday.
Is it safe to eat raw eggs?
What is the height of the Empire State Building?
Hi, how are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did anything illegal.
Unfortunately, that is true.
Can we lock this door?
I don't know what to say.
What are you all doing here?
The police arrested the robber.
Keep Tom in the dark.
I'm not going to school today.
You two come with me.
Tom drank red wine, and Mary drank white wine.
I read the article.
They used to own it.
He doesn't even notice me.
He's the shame of the whole town.
Are you stubborn?
The pigeon was all over it.
This is my favorite.
I don't think anyone noticed what Tom was doing.
I'm not selling my soul.
This isn't my house.
They should be moving fast.
I think you paid too much for it.
I'll take him.
I wanted to eat pizza.
She said she didn't want to sleep.
You don't have time.
You're taller than all of us.
I was born here.
I asked my boss to raise my salary.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?
Could you walk me out?
Mary covered her face with her hands.
What if he's wrong?
Tom looks a little like his father.
We never talked about it.
I know what it means.
I had to act fast.
Mary said she would do it herself.
Don't you remember me telling you all this?
These girls just want to have fun.
I spoke to the doctors in French.
Robots are used to make cars.
Tom has never been punctual.
Tom and Mary are sleeping.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Drink to my health!
He cut himself with a knife yesterday.
The singer suddenly switches to falsetto.
You don't have a fever.
Thank you so much for that information.
I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'll have to do without this old one.
Tom doesn't think there is life on Mars.
I can't spend all day here.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I went to see Dan.
I met him a few months ago.
These gloves belong to him.
She doesn't look more than sixty.
Can you trust her?
She is a talented singer.
I've done this many times.
Don't play poker with them.
Tom is very upset about something.
I'll call her right away.
I want to dedicate this song to Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom held the rope with both hands.
Tom doesn't pay attention to Mary.
Tom lives in the same building as me.
Don't blame others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom burned his fingers on the stove.
They took her.
Mary could do that if she tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one, too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?
Tom likes oranges.
That's the current plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I think about them all day.
I can't read or write.
How is Tom now?
Tom left on time.
Tom stayed there for a few days.
The X-ray showed two broken fingers.
Tom said Mary was very hungry.
Tom had to go there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
Let's wait a while.
The law must be obeyed.
Tom made Mary wait a long time.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm doing this for the money.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I have the check?
I thought you'd laugh.
Mary put on two sweaters.
You'll understand when you see Tom.
I want to hire them.
I'm sure he's smart.
Which way should I go?
Were you born there?
My hearing's not what it used to be.
He said it was nine already.
The butterfly flew.
There's no time for that.
Both of these suitcases are mine.
Prices are going up.
She's not wrong.
Today I'm finally going to tell Tom what I really think of him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I like winter.
Show me her photo.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom doesn't think that, of course.
He called me just as I was about to go to bed.
If I can do it, you can do it.
The sun was shining on his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
