Welsh AMs worried about 'how to be a fool'
There is a fear of danger among some AMs over the decision to change their status to MWPs (Welsh Members of Parliament).
The move was prompted by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
THE political world was so concerned that it could lead to ridicule.
A Labour MP said the group was concerned "it was aligned with the Twp and the Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means madness and pwp means percentage.
One Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said the gang had nothing in mind about changing the name, but noted a brief comment from MWP to Muppet.
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name change, said: The final decision on any specific items that identify what members of the Assembly are called will also be a matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on the resolutions of those who received the most support for the call for the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP's choice was more favourable in a public debate.
Clearly AMs are suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach a settlement can be difficult for the Superintendent, Elin Jones, who is expected to roll out the bill on changes in weeks.
The bill on the amendments will include other changes to the way the House operates, including rules on determining the inequalities of AMs and regulating the composition of the committee.
AMs will have a final vote on what to call them when they argue the law.
Macedonians go to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was set up as an attempt to resolve an annual conflict with Greece, a Greek state with its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern target's name represents a claim against its territory and has repeatedly refused to seek membership in the European Union and the NATO Cooperation Organization.
Macedonia's president Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the direct election system on changing the name, said he would abandon the election.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of a party is a necessary step to join the European Union and the NATO Cooperation Alliance.
St. Martin's Bells Silent Because of the War in the Synagogue in Harlem
Historically, old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church in every corner, Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is none.
He said that the loss of a sense of smell is a natural phenomenon.
People are having a different time these days, the machine.
Brinks are no longer the most crowded rooms where people come to.
As for the churches, he was concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the property would not be as short as the leaders expected, and sooner or later would return if they started.
He added that churches and apartment buildings would be replaced with large, crowded halls that would not serve as a refuge for the other refugees.
Most people who will buy large areas in these buildings will be white, he said, so they will be quick to say that these churches are closed completely because there is a possibility that most of these people who moved into these large areas will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white settlers before Harlem became a black community - the Village Community in 1870, ten years after St. Martin's.
The white origin of Methodist participants emerged in the 1930s.
A group of black worshippers who worshipped nearby took over the building.
A pious black community took over the leadership of St. Martin's under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led traders to move to shop on the 125 line, a major shopping street in Harlem, which was committed to hiring workers or supporting black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's followers made plans to rebuild, they opened the church's musical instruments.
David Johnson's half-brother, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the church's musical instruments the "sounds of the common people".
The expert who sounded the alarm in July called it something different: Another cultural treasure reserve and An irreplaceable relics.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first musical instrument to be sung by a black composer, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved the main organ at Riverside Hall 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What appeared at St. Martin's a few months ago became a confusing story of artists and contractors, some brought by uneducated church leaders, and others by the authority of the Episcopal clergy.
The vestry committee - the administrative body for the parish boundary area, which included uneducated leaders - wrote to the high priest in July with concerns that the parish boundary area would ask for the funds to be transferred to the vestry committee, even though the vestry committee was not appointed to hire designers by the contractors who had established the parish boundary area.
Some followers complained about the lack of publicity about what was done by the area bordering the synagogue.
A 13-year-old lobster hunter in California is injured by a giant sea fish
A giant sea fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was hunting for losbter in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Bay in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming and went there with a group of people to drag him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a pleasure to catch a losbter, but then he found that he was shouting, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
His shoulderbone was completely opened, the machine Hammel had seen when he reached the boy.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water". Hammel added, "There's a big fish in the sea!"
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed in critical condition.
The species of the giant fish that attacked the island is unknown.
Life-saving captain Larry Giles told reporters that a large sea fish had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not of any species and was an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of his back.
Officials closed access to the coast from the Ponto Bay in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for search and rescue purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of large sea fish in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsburys prepares to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams along with the same fashion store parts that are hired by its staff and professional helpers.
As part of the UK £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow despite declining domestic jewellery markets, the top-selling cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country and shipped to additional stores next year if the product wins.
Investments in the beauty industry are coming as the big department stores are struggling to make way for empty spaces like TVs, kitchen appliances and household items.
Sainsburys said it would scale its cosmetics production to nearly 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have regional variants of the same type as those found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its range of modern products as most of the products become vegan-friendly - something that is gaining increasing demand for small retailers.
In addition, the perfume store will attempt to offer discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying a little food every day in local convenience stores means that the big retail stores must be committed to attracting people to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said side stores will continue to look like supermarkets with parts as the chain of supermarkets tries to compete with discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsburys has been putting Argos' side stores in hundreds of shops and has introduced other Habitats since it bought their listing two years ago, which it says further enhances the food trade where it also makes the acquisition more profitable.
Efforts at the department store to restore the parts of the medicine ended in failure.
Sainsburys attempted a business partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger came to an end after a dispute over how to divide the revenue from pharmacies into its own department stores.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's chain of stores, for £125 million.
He said Llyods would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's's marketing director said: "We've changed the look and feel of the packaging parts to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in our specially trained colleagues who would be close to us in counseling.
Our range of types is designed to suit every need and the convenient and convenient environment means a destination for attractive packaging that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'got angry' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11 million contract
Dragons star Peter Jones went 'off the rails' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby left her £11 million contract and her business lifestyle to return to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time for their home furnishings and Truly's supporting cast.
Their business was associated with the Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter went to Instagram where she announced she would be leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons" star Peter Jones angrily said she was leaving their lucrative business model at the end of the season - to face her new muscle contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
The sources said Jones was upset when the popular TV personality confirmed during a lively discussion on Tuesday at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she now didn't have enough time to waste on her household goods and Truly's support packages.
The business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was said to attract a secondary share of Willoughby's estate valued at £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, posted on Instagram announcing that she would be leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane to pass one of his vacation homes.
One source says: Truly is above Holly's priorities.
It will be a long-term camp for her to live in the future as it will be for some years to come.
The verdict she delivered put all those in attendance in a state of shock.
No one could have believed what happened on Tuesday, near the inauguration.
There is a large warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters that are scheduled to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, which is among Britain's biggest stars, will cause millions of losses for the company due to overinvestment in products from cooking to candles to clothing and household goods, and the possibility of a delay in its launch.
And he would give the final answer by a longtime friend.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, had joined as CEO in March.
The couple often spend holidays together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will be a product ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I'm a Celebrity.
A footballer near Jones said last night We will not comment on his business activities.
The big story and that's when we started dating
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for making a comment that others would consider "inappropriate for the president" and for seeing something positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said in his voice that he was "a journalist".
I left nothing behind.
He noted that Kim was interested in the second round of talks after their first meeting in Singapore in June which Trump saw as a major step towards reducing nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the nuclear arms reduction pacts have failed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not seen any such "commitment" from the United States to the push for a nuclear arms reduction initiated by the North.
Time and again, he noted, the United States has continued to impose sanctions with the intention of continuing to press the numbers.
Trump took a view he felt was possible in his rally speech.
"Everything is going well with North Korea", he said.
To start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
And now we have this close relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim produced positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free the hostages and getting the rest of the American troopers home.
And he defended his path a bit in his conversation and interaction with Kim.
"It's easy for a president to behave, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this place, we're going to have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing straight at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian forest and earthquake devastate the island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although almost 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, no national emergency was declared, a condition that would draw national and international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking national assistance, so it is a minor challenge, said Ms. Sumbung.
When Save the Children brought together an organization to Palu, it was not sure if foreign workers would be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Security Agency, said Indonesian officials were monitoring the situation in Palu to see if national and international representatives would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the tremors Indonesia experienced, the country became seriously unprepared for the disaster of life.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they were not visible in the coastal areas.
The lack of bloodshed in the tsunami warning that came out in Palu, although a warning was in effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, the isolation between the many Indonesian islands was a challenge.
The divisions that God sent made the distribution of necessities extremely difficult.
A ship-based hospital in Lombok is on its way to Palu to treat the victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has turned over the damaged Indonesian infrastructure that put him at the forefront of his election campaign, and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But lack of funds plagued Mr. Joko's government as he faced re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from the religious and anti-apartheid protests, where the majority of Muslims have adopted a radical form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were left homeless as Christian and Muslim thugs fought in the streets, using religious weapons, spears, and other vicious weapons.

Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool from a Premier League Challenge Cup match where he lost to Chelsea with a win in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a kick from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards away from Chelsea's win with his teammates following 1-0.
He touched the ball to his left before hitting a long distance.
The effort went above the box where it descended to the top right corner of the ram.
The ball eventually fell over the leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga, where it fell into the trunk.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com that It was just an attempt to get into this spot, get the ball and Players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to create myself sometimes as much as possible.
I saw Kante coming and touching once and didn't think much about it so I just hit.
Chelsea were the first to score 1 and 0 in the first half after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues' attacking player once again handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the match, before running into the middle of the field and running in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic immediately made a bid and ran into the middle of the field.
Then he made another good ball, where he pushed Hazard into the box.
Hazard passed the goalkeepers and finished in the top of the fast-paced goal position with a left foot where he overtook Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool played Napoli in the group stage of the Challenge Cup at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will join Videoton in the UEFA Europa Leaguge Challenge Cup at 3pm on Thursday in London.
More deaths from the Indonesian tsunami to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake rose to 832, the country's disaster management agency said early Sunday.
The building was destroyed by a massive earthquake of 7.5 magnitude on Friday and caused flooding for 20 metres, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
Palu, a city of more than 380,000 people, is home to the remains of brick buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man accused of murdering a woman by stabbing her
An investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, along with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police searched the area for people who saw or heard anything to alert.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone around John's Line in Birkenhead who saw or heard something that he did not agree with that had contacted us.
I would also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a picture on the front camera to contact us, not surprisingly because they may have information that is relevant to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose father's body was found was from the Birkenhead area and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who knew the woman who had been there to ask questions about where she had been found that morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police say they are planning to inform the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his home but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he could not speak.
The residents were told that it would take hours for them to be allowed to return.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, tears in her eyes.
She kept repeating What a terrible thing.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon two police cars collided with only one truck outside.
Some officers stood in the massacre and watched the area of the houses.
Anyone with information sent by DM @MerPolCC is required to call 101 or contact the Crime Prevention Service in private on 0800 555 111 using the 247 listing dated 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell Parliament became the most recent memorial to the man who said The struggle to rewrite history
Green will be responsible for the destruction of British historical, cultural and religious sites as the Taliban's radical followers have done.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as a "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable that in the current debate over the removal of the statue the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be an object of attack.
Cromwell did not order or act on attacks on the high points of the English Civil War.
Perhaps the worst thing to see behind Cromwell's head was the actions of his grandfather Thomas over the past century.
There is a great deal of information about Cromwell by William Hamo Thorneycroft that is an argument for 19th-century philosophy that is also part of the historiography of a famous person that most believe should still be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell was viewed by many, perhaps more so in the last decades of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in an inevitable crisis of monarchy.
Whether that statement would be anything else entirely accurate is a subject of ongoing debate from a historical standpoint.
What is certain is that the crisis of the mid-17th century changed the course of our country's later development, and Cromwell was a well-known figure who represented a part of that crisis.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered.
A Chinese Farmer Is Stung by a Pig's Dead
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southeastern China, according to local media reports.
The man was identified only with his nickname "Yuan", which was found in a woman with a severed neck vein, all blood covered near a sty at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer planned to inject pigs into a pig barn on May 30, 2005 in Xining and Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly took a meeting with his brother from the capital of Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his brother found a woman, and he saw a door to a pigsty barn open.
He said that a large male pig was found in the style with blood on its mouth.
A scientific study of the incident confirmed that 550-pound pigs crushed the farmers to the point of death, according to the report.
My brother's legs were in blood and bent, my brother mentioned his nickname with Wu machine, as Guiyang Evening News reported.
Video from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his family.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A business manager told the Evening News that the pigs were locked up to prevent him from attacking another person, while the police were also gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities were reportedly discussing paying compensation for his death.
Although few, examples of swine attacks on humans have been seen.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man in serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer in his cage until his wife frightened the animal and ran away.
After being eaten by an Oregun farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not aggressive but blood pressure could be a factor in the poem.
They're just playing.
They're contagious, curious... they're not out to get sick.
You just have to respect them properly, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
As predictions suggest, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters of the Mexican coast.
However, Rosa is expected to cause flooding throughout northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa was experiencing winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was spotted at 385 miles (385 km) southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tidal wave began to rise above the Pacific Ocean moving eastward into the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approached the Baja California Strait on Monday as a major threat it would begin to push the heat wave northward into the southeastern United States.
Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the heat wave combined with the prevailing tides would create a rainfall that would reach many parts of the southeast in the coming days.
In a home, 1 to 14 inches of rainfall could lead to severe flooding, a flood of fossils and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Extreme temperatures can lead to rainfall estimates of 2 to 3 inches per hour in areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
About two to four inches of rain are expected in the south-eastern parts, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of sudden flooding as the climate continues to deteriorate due to the heavy rainfall in the tropics.
It would be a bad idea to go out into the wilderness and watch the threat of rain in the hot climate.
Heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to become flowing rivers and the waterfall can cause dust to form and dust to settle.
The storm surge that you face will bring heavy domestic rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
There is a possibility of a total rainfall of over an inch, which will result in a small amount of debris and smooth roadways.
This would be the first provincial rainfall of their winter season.
A tropical storm will begin to hit Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rainfall will be very low on Monday late on Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
The month of October may see a severe climate change across the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics will remain warm.
At times this can lead to dramatic changes in the weather for a short time.
There was another great example of the extraordinary variation in weather across Central America on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the heat of summer will try to build and expand again.
Most of Central and Eastern America is expected to see a warm period beginning in October with a random 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
New York City may reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is at least 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of a moderate weather forecast for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's speech was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the archival testimony of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and his wife Christine Blasey Ford on six television networks in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with the media including the regular plan for a late Friday coup: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her of her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a sad testimony, said he was 100 percent convinced that it did not happen.
No wonder more than 20.4 million people in Nielsen's report watched the video.
The company calculated the average viewership by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate demographic for other networks that showed the event, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring the number of people who visit their offices.
To put it simply, that's like the size of the audience at a football game that you win your station with an Academy Award.
Fox News, which was heavily supported by commentators, took Kavanaugh's take, leading all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's talk, according to Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The desire was high after the hearing.
Flake is a popular centerpiece in the Friday night market.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would select Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras showed him on Friday screaming at protesters as he tried to climb a pickup truck to the top floor of the Committee on the Law meeting room.
He stared at the ground for several minutes during the screaming, televised show on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you feel he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have all the strength, while many women have little strength".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the reception was shut down, that he had much to say in the committee's debate.
Cable networks and broadcasters both broadcast the event a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a separate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would review the identity of the person named next week, which Democratic Party officials had hoped.
Flake was satisfied with a brief solo and interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several later senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was strong, because Republicans would obviously not get the vote to approve Kavanaugh without a vote.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the rumors about Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May condemned Brexit critics and political activism
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticized her plans to leave the European Union, the "political transformation" of Britain's future and the corruption of the country's interests in a conversation with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Meeting in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a later interview on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson criticized her attack on her Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a decision that Britain and the European Union should receive mutual funds was "totally a conspiracy".
Wayde Sims shooting Police arrested Dyteon Simpson accused of murdering an LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the match between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the match.
Police recovered the glass from the scene of the crime where they also claimed to have found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a WAFB report linked to CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he was responsible for the brutal shooting of Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate report.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head that went through the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police officers who were involved in the escape, the state's medical science testing unit, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for helping with the investigation that led to the case.
LSU ski director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their kind work of "providing justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and returned a 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team suffered a concussion and concussion and Wayde's death.
"That's what people worry about all the time", Wade said.
A large volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The fountain of Popocatepetl reached the southern tip of Mexico City.
The National Center for Accident Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the rocks after the explosion, and to report 183 gas emissions and ash emissions for more than 24 hours.
The center is responsible for the management of earthquakes and landslides.
Social media footage showed a thin, ashes-covered crawling body on a car's glass in Mexico City's suburbs such as Xochimilco.
Meteorologists have observed an increase in activity in the mountains located about 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" volcano has been erupting for centuries since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan mobsters ahead of the Independence Day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters marched out with riot police, and as thousands joined the anti-government protests to celebrate the referendum that divided Catalonia on the uprising.
A group of blindfolded vigilantes held by police beat them with spears and sprinkled powder, creating a dark cloud in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
The riot broke out later that day when the police used their earrings to stop the riot.
For more than several hours, the group of pro-democracy activists responded by saying "No forgetting, no apology" and protestors shouted "God bless Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Violence is still rampant in the province that has kept the independence in its heart a year after the October 1 referendum which Madrid considers illegal but which Catalan separatists are celebrating.
Voters voted in favor of freedom, although there were few exceptions where those who did not want to be part of the party abstained.
According to Catalan authorities, at least 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the polling stations across the province in the wake of the violence.
Groups of pro-independence protesters stood outside at night supporting the national police.
The violence continued but she was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, 68, a Latino who was taking part in the protest with his wife, said he also did not hope to see Catalonia's possible independence.
Last year we lived in one of our best times.
I watched my parents cry for the right to vote but now we are stuck inside, he said.
Despite a significant victory and even a crushing defeat in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to keep up this year's campaign with many of their prominent leaders either going to seek asylum and hanging themselves or being detained awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who takes protest in police support on his phone, said the crisis was fueled by political rallies from all sides.
It makes the dirt even more dirty, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan presidents who has been detained before trial since late last year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the values of democracy and oppression we have seen from the Spanish government, he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was banned at home
A group of men, aged 33, 34 and 29, were arrested after a small car was repeatedly driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 P.M. BST.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and even his own home were damaged.
At times, a small car may have been hit by a bug and a bow.
Menga's win gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's win gave Livingston a win
Livingston's promotion surprised the Rangers where she kept Steven Gerrard to his second-most successful 18-game spell as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack was a turning point as Gary Holt's side moved flat with Hibernian in the second leg.
Gerrard's side is still without a win against him in the Premiership this season and will face the Leaders Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers had received Rapid Vienna in a Europa League game on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livinsgton, have increased their unbeaten record in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste the batting since replacing Kenny Miler a month ago.
Livingston lost the opportunity to their visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead before they won, with their own faces causing Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson was pregnant but pulled his efforts forward in the face of victory, and Alan Lithgow was the only one who could face his efforts after making the ground to meet the drunken Craig Halkett.
The Rangers were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the visitors to be on a single list.
And that is how the important meal was conducted.
The Rangers agreed to a non-stop strike and Livingston worked on a second attempt, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining forces to design Menga, who touched and ate from the center of the box.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated holding the ball but found the home guard would not allow passing and the catcher Liam Kelly was completely unconcerned.
This situation continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced another rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman did not get a chance from Rangers catcher Allan McGregor and Lithgow was heavily out of a game designed by Livingston.
Then a regular printing press came to Livingston's box where their treatment was continued, while a printing press was found from the head until a goal - after Halkett challenged to replace Glenn Middleton, and one for hand-touching - was pushed aside.
Amazing from Livingston - review
Alasdair Lamont Scotland in the area of Tony Macaroni
A remarkable game and result for Livingston.
To one man, they were so impressed, they kept going beyond expectations on this one occasion.
Their style of play and staffing has changed slightly since their return to the top position, but the main credit should go to Holt and the way he has connected the team since his arrival.
He has many heroes.
Captain Halkett arranged, where he arranged a better guard, when Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet.
The Rangers were almost discouraged, almost.
Despite their excellent performance under Gerrard, they failed to achieve such a level playing field.
Their final blow was not enough - they only cut open the side of the house once - and it was a refreshing call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a similar reception in Cologne
A variety of smiles and blue skies were seen on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
On its last day President Erdogan's complex visit to Germany - designed to repair relations between NATO allies.
They found disagreements on other issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then passed Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a crowd of about 25,000 from a gathering in front of the mosque, but several supporters appeared nearby to see their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - mostly Kurds - voiced their voices, calling for a God-like return to the country, in line with Erdogan's resolutions and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The local rings represent the split of the arrival of a visitor who was admired by the Germans as a hero and the doll as a fake to the others.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a collision involving a small car in London.
This time it happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the ambulance staff arrived, but the man died on the scene.
This time it was months after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
City police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and bus routes switched, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in clashes
Six officers were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
"Tornado" officials were brought in to deal with the violence, which consisted of eight prisoners and was reduced to one section.
The officers were treated for facial injuries at the scene.
According to a spokesperson for the Prison Ministry: Skilled and trained staff were deployed to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not expect violence in our prisons, and they said that those involved would be sent and there is a possibility that they will be sent to the back of the cells soon.
The HMP Long Lartin held more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot police officers tackled a violent incident in which workers and balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and flooding (Severe Flooding may occur)
It is unlikely that any heat loss has occurred in Arizona, but this is likely to occur as early as next week as the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosan tracks across the Southeastern Desert, creating rising flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already released observational data on Monday and Tuesday's rising flooding for Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route up the Phoenix tower on Tuesday, pushing toward the end of Monday with the rain.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service noted in a statement posted on Twitter that only 10 "extreme winds" have produced a tropical or subtropical climate within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The most recent National Hurricane Center models have produced 2 to 4 inches of rain, with about 6 inches of unprecedented rainfall in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are not surprisingly 1 to 2 inches high with a total of about 4 inches in diameter.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rainfall may be a boon since the area is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of this rainfall will be beneficial since the Southeast is now experiencing dry weather.
According to the U.S. Department of State's Drought Control Agency, only over 40 percent of Arizona sees at least one severe drought, the second-highest, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa passed through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico to the bottom.
Rosa, still strong on Sunday mornings with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving at 12 miles per hour.
The crater meets the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and thus descends.
As a result, it is expected to land in Mexico in the heat of summer and in the sun or evening on Monday.
No wonder heavy rains in parts of Mexico have caused further flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to south-eastern Sonora, according to weather.com.
Rosa would then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as the summer's lowest, from where it would then travel across Arizona and into southern Itah at the end of Tuesday night.
"The most anticipated hazard from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", according to the National Hurricane Center.
These waters are expected to produce flooding, precipitation, and erosion in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three other children and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found with injuries in the Excelsior Area of Midsomer Norton Park, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a very poor condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock, Avon area on Saturday night by Somerset Police.
Officials asked anyone who might have a small cell phone video of what happened.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the hardships, the sadness, the anger of the Democratic Party
Another vote for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the ruthless and powerful tactics of the Democratic Party, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the unkind, angry reaction of the Democratic Party by pushing his name.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, loudly and furiously denying a rumor from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her many years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified in the audience about her own fiction.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's skill, beauty and courage that day.
Another vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh West was a vote to confirm one of the most successful jurists of our time, a jurist with a distinguished record of public service, West Virginia supporters said in a public address.
The president made a brief comment about pushing Kavanaugh's name when he spoke about the utility of the Republican exit in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important decisions of our lifetime.
I won't stop, but I will actually stop, he said.
That is why I always fight for the top candidates.
Trump in the debate Democrats are on a mission to fight bribery.
The first major move is expected to lead to a vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's election to be held no later than Friday, a senior aide to the GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds died in the earthquake in Indonesia, and more deaths
At least 384 people, including passengers and crew, were killed by massive waves on the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, officials said.
Hundreds of people gathered for a feast on the coast of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of water raining in the sky (about 18 waves) hit the coast at night, wiping out many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were working on the coast and did not immediately flee where they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian risk reduction agency BNPB in a brief interview with journalists in Jakarta.
The tsunami came on its own, dragging trucks, logs, houses, and hitting everything on the ground, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled along the open sea at speeds of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before landing on the coast.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The images taken from the sky by the emergency department again showed buildings and shops in ruins, bridges bent and collapsed and a water-filled mosque surrounded it.
The previous wave of thunderstorms that hit the coastal city on Saturday continued.
A series of earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.400,000 people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Testing and Implementation (BPPT) in a statement said the strength and intensity of the massive earthquake released on Friday was nearly 200 times the strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The climate of the city, which sits at the end of a small, high-altitude ridge, may have contributed to the tsunami's magnitude, she said.
Nugroho described the damage as "mostly" and said tens of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were all destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found in a quarry underneath the collapsed buildings, the report said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage would increase sharply along the coastline 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu, a region known as Donggala,
Communication was generally stopped and there was no news from Donggala, the Nugroho's ear.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had targeted the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it could get worse", she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not announcing a tsunami would strike Palu, although officials said the tides had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
A video posted on social media by an unskilled man can be heard on the roof of a building shouting a warning of an approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Within minutes a wall of water collapsed on the sea, carrying buildings and trucks.
Reuters news agency could not immediately verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and disconnections around Palu which caused difficulties for authorities in coordinating rescue efforts.
The military began sending large cargo and relief vessels from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but those that were taken were still in dire need of food and other vital supplies.
The city's airport was reopened exclusively for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 800
It was a mess.
Although World Vision personnel have returned to Palu safely at least from Donggala, where the staff live in the tanks installed in their own office yard, they have shown a tendency to collapse along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said we saw many houses destroyed", he said.
The situation was very bad.
Despite the fact that a number of relief groups have begun a major campaign to start disaster relief work, some have complained that highly skilled outside relief workers are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, spending, production and employment from abroad will only begin if the location of the trial is declared a national disaster camp.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a flat disaster area", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, He did, this would be a national disaster, we will open for national and international aid but no status yet.
As the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the victims hoped that their relatives would become miracles to bring to life the sad news of the disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a garbage bin.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under a two-day burning spell with her mother's body near her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian team, coached the two missing athletes of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were assaulted at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a player in the game, I'm also a little bit shy", he said.
Mr Gendon explained how, within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse being spread among the community of the landing party from above, he sent WhatsApp messages in a tunnel to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach party.
His messages, however, only produced one gray-colored mark, instead of two blue-colored markings.
"I think it means not sending messages", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 when they refilled ATMs in Newport on the Prairie
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Doabo, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the minivan was removing an ATM from a recreational building and preparing to bring in more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the announcement.
While at work, a man ran after Brink's employee and stole a purse to be brought.
Witnesses witnessed many of the suspects flee the scene, but the police did not say how many were inside.
Anyone with information about their testimony should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Yes
The rapper changes his name - to Yes.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I would have been known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West, who was nicknamed Yes for a while and used the moniker in the name of his eighth album, was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show which he cancelled for "disappointment reasons", the show's creative engineer said.
As a shortened form of his current professional name, West once said the word had a religious meaning to him.
I believe ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it refers to kai, said West earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with the host of the radio show Big Boy.
So I am you, we are you.
It went from Kanye, meaning one, to the only Yes - just a hint of our beauty, our deception, everything.
The tape seems to be a reflection of who we are.
He was one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs was known by various names as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but that year he announced that his preference for the names Love and Brother Love was.
Another West collaborator, JAY-Z, also often did with or without a short line of middle word and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico vowed not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody massacre of students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza never again to use the military to crush Mexicans.
The troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the center on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at one time as student activists began to find refuge in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly scholarships to those who are studying and opening more public universities free of charge.
He also said that unemployment and a lack of education are the main reasons why young people are drawn into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should be bankrupting A.I.
As China becomes more active in non-native intelligence, the United States should be investing more in research in the field, a research engineer and non-native intelligence analyst named Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments commented on non-native intelligence AI, despite the fact that the United States lacked a single AI strategy in custody.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it is seeking to become the world's leading AI manufacturer by 2030.
Sharing the AI budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for something new in AI, Lee said.
Spending fluctuations could double the chances of achieving the next big AI in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures China, which invests in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat out the top American actor Othello, and later became a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee cited previous U.S. government competitions on technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge where he asked when the advance would be made, because it helped identify future telescopes.
Analysts in the United States often work hard to get government funding, Lee says.
It's not China that hires knowledge leaders; it's companies, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired top academics from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said the change in the country's immigration policy could also help the United States with its AI efforts.
"I feel that my green cards should be self-sustaining and be provided to graduates in the field of non-primary AI", he said.
The Chinese National Assembly released the Sustainable Development Goals for the Future of the Nation in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding for people in science schools similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding for U.S. researchers, but the level of academic performance is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Non-Natural Intelligence, designed to engage partners from industry and school, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Non-Natural Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an effort called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Currently, the U.S. bill seeking to create a National Security Agency on Non-Natural Intelligence has not seen any action in months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, in a bid to resolve a longstanding dispute with Greece that blocked its membership to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its border and has advanced its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two governments gained a new status in June under a new name they had decided on, but nationalist opponents argued the change would reduce the popularity of the predominantly Macedonian Slavic ethnic group.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a campaign to remove the candidate raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent needed to improve the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot is: You are a NATO member and a member of the European Union and accept the agreement with Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a compromise to pursue membership in institutions such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia because they can live freely under the banner of the European Union because it means a safe life for us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the results of the vote so that it is evenly distributed.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority of the legislature.
The national election commission said no problems had been reported until 1 a.m.
However, the turnout stood at only 15 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because my son, our position is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, along with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, voted in a referendum in Macedonia on a name change that would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia on September 3, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small parade and pulled up the seats in front of tents set up by the anti-apartheid movement.
"We are NATO and the European Union, but we want to enter with dignity, not behind the door of work", said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor nation, but we are perfect.
If they do not want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European-Asian union.
Prime Minister Zaev said that becoming a NATO member would bring significant investment to Macedonia, which has an estimated unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
I believe many would like it because more than 80% of our citizens want the European Union and NATO, inji Zaev said after his vote.
He said another outcome of eh would be a guarantee of our future.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Decision Studies on Monday said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
A poll, by the Macedonian television station Telma, found 57 percent of respondents were preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would like to throw a yes.
To win the referendum the need for a 50% vote and one more vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first obstacle to the resolutions of Western supporters since it took the lead in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City travels through Brighton's security entirely to win
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling pushed Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed a slight disgust at his own meal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a push in the middle of the field early in the series.
He ran through the Brighton guards, before cutting into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green robes.
He pushed around one guard before avoiding the other at the side of the box in Brighton.
He then sent a gift to his right, where he found Sterling.
The England forward used his first leg in the box to pass the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to kick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and a second-half all the way to the right side of the goal.
Aguero is struggling with some issues in his policies, according to a report by City manager Pep Guardiola.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We managed to win another win this time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance in the Premier League crisis.
The victory came in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball in Brighton's limit very well in that match.
He sent a beautiful internal ball through the left field to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the end of the long distance.
The Sky Blues forward hit the ball into the goal just before exiting the limits.
City are facing Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wanted to be a rock climber
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force a reboot.
But the all-time league fan Scherzer hopes to take the Sunday collection over the Colorado Rockies, but only if he still has only the impressive re-plays for the Rockies, who hold a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they were still looking to close their first division position.
Although we were playing a little bit, we could at least play rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver was with the public arena and one team would play on each of the highest levels of any big game I'd ever face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have yet to announce a start for Sunday but are reportedly willing to let Scherzer aggravate the situation.
Scherzer, who would be his 34th, threw a big time on Thursday and would persecute his exact Sunday break.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump marched in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the benefits of the Republican exit in the midterm elections.
Everything we did stopped in November.
Five weeks from now from one of the most rewarding choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big - I'm not going to stop but actually I'm going to stop it so I'm all over the place fighting for the local candidate, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this disaster, the disaster group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to seize power by whatever means they can, you see, the sadness, the misery.
They have not been given power and control by anyone who has caused them to be angry, and who will destroy them. Therefore, they have sought power and control, and we will not give it to them.
The Democratic Party, he said, was on a mission to fight the barrier.
And you see that in the last four days, he said, he's been calling the Democrats angry and sad and violent and unfair.
He named the senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who was shouted out by the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you read the paper?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I was waiting for one - that was a terrible sign of dishonesty - the worst sign of dishonesty I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a major party.
A form of impatience of those who express their feelings
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to stop me, it was no surprise.
Since I was the newest member of the Labour Party to be told we were not welcome - all because of our feelings.
My friend Joan Ryan in Congress was treated with the same shame because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the suspension issue has disrupted me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the benefit of a good economic plan, on national security, on Europe, unfortunately the same issues that Jeremy's head has rejected by previous leaders.
A statement for the Nottingham East Labour Conference on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be connected to the mainstream".
For most of the eight years as a Labour member of parliament, the same was true of the GC meetings.
Unfortunately today, it is not the feature of many meetings and the political promise of ihsani, mind is already forgotten if, too, it has ever been started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated within the Labour Party and any opinion is condemned on whether it will be accepted by the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became president, because my former political colleagues began to expect me to make a revolution and take a position that I would never accept - whether it was on national security or the single market of the European Union.
I have always spoken publicly - and it is not clear what I said - only that the social networking network is calling for re-election, central politics is ignored, we are told that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that is not all I have seen.
In fact, I knew I was better off than my colleagues because the orders I was given were often political.
I am in the teahouse of the experience and determination of these colleagues who face a discrimination of gender or race every day but never run away.
One of the most disheartening aspects of this political era is the prevalence of flat-rate corruption.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should develop a culture of tolerance.
What is really happening is that we are not that big synagogue and that there is no issue of not being able to accept  or changing the electoral laws if the party becomes smaller.
I've had a lot of garbage in the last couple of years called me silent, don't make noise and that's why I'm going to be no problem
But I did not get involved in politics because of this.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, having been encouraged by Thatcher government ministers to let the school year drop, I thought I was a hero of reforming public services for those in need - whether as a local chancellor or a government minister.
I never hid my political affiliation, even in the last election.
No one from East Nottingham should be asked to be misled about my determination and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who have promoted Friday's issue, all I can say is that as the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and government jobs, I don't understand the urge to waste time and courage on the fear of the Labour leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not to the Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, to Labour or not: I am proud to work for the public and I promise that no threat to re-election or political fraud will prevent me from working in what I believe is the best way to serve the public at large.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr unblemished to the sky
Two slow tests skipped the final result a bit, but Ayr was undoubtedly right to win this amazing Tennent Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the table, the only remaining part of the tenth.
Eventually, their higher level of security, such as their ability to communicate more effectively, took over the side of the house and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be happy.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Welcome Ayr, they took their concerns more seriously than we did.
A 14-minute test of Anderson's speed, replaced by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, returned by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to score against Jason Baggot
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, during the halftime break, he won it and traded a single test to make it 17 to 5 to Ayr on the break.
But Melrose started the second half right and Patrick Anderson tried, replaced by Baggot, to reduce the passage to five steps.
There was previously a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was taken on late, and a re-start, Ayr pushed forward the top-flight through a Test match against Stafford McDowall, which Climo replaced.
Then the captain's deputy Ayr Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose made the man pay for another unrequited Bruce Colvine test, which ended in a brutal pressure attack.
The side of the house was returned, however, and when a yellow card was given to Struan Hutchinson to approach Climo without the ball, from the outside line of the penalty, MacPherson touched the ground from behind the approaching Ayr offense.
The climate changed, as he did again at least from the start, after Kyle Rowe collected a boxing bat for David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry out for a fifth home side test.
Game star is still preparing for a new job in the food industry
Game star Ford Kieran has also revealed that he plans to enter the grocery industry after being discovered to have been offered the position of director of a licensed grocery company.
The 56-year-old appears in Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, writing and starring alongside fellow comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the final in the show's run, and revealed Kiernan was planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the company's own records, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun newspaper alleged that Kiernan was seeking to enter the Glasgow fast food market.
It's our ocean: Bolivia's landlocked country hopes a court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the station of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Government buildings were made of blue-green flags.
The naval fleet from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon was mottoed: The sea is ours in its own right.
Bringing it back is our right.
In the whole of Bolivia and the surrounding land, remember that Chile lost a coastal area to a terrible 19th-century resource crisis that was still evident - because it was because of the need to navigate the waters of the Pacific Ocean again.
These racial disparities were perhaps greatest in years, when Bolivia was awaiting a minor ruling by the international court on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia is dynamic, united and stable, and certainly expects a good thing to come out", says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Bolivia will watch the World Court's ruling on major television stations across the country, hoping that the Hague court will find a way to accept Bolivia's request - after years of unsuccessful negotiations - Chile has agreed to negotiate where it gives Bolivia the right to a solution to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's popular native president - who is facing a disastrous campaign for re-election next year - has a big chance of getting out of Monday's ruling.
We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean, at a press conference in late August.
But some pirates believed that it would be difficult to decide how Bolivia would like to do - and that nothing would change if it did.
The United Nations Commissioner for Refugees in the Netherlands had no authority to issue a border with Chile, and it stated that it would not decide what the possible outcome of the negotiations would be.
That the World Court's ruling comes only six months after the final hearing of the participants showed the case was unconfusing, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And he was not close to the legal aid of Bolivia, which four years ago may have drawn her back.
The Bolivian government has now seized the issue of access to the sea, Zárate said.
The unruly Morales's actions ended all Chilean sympathy, in her opinion.
Bolivia and Chile will at times continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have a conversation after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the argument that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will provide Bolivia with an unprecedented opportunity to open a new chapter of relations with Chile and an opportunity to bring an end to 139 years of disagreement with each other's interests, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular leaders - had used the maritime issue as a political issue.
He added: "Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean.
The sentence is an opportunity to see that the past has been forgotten.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come until it can trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never give up its nuclear weapons from the start unless it trusted Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the pledges made at a summit in Singapore among future leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was about to resume the diplomatic push for nuclear more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was just another dream that was continuing to ban the US with a statement that ending the Korean War would eventually bring the Korean War to its knees.
Washington was hesitant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant effort to reduce its weapons.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are generally looking for a second summit.
But there is widespread disagreement that Pyongyang is not fully committed to the abandonment of a weapon that the country sees as almost its only guarantee of defense.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit with Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has released the newest line in your collection on its way to a Grand Titi near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat or block it completely, then do not add to it.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne displayed large and elegant headgear for their SS19 garment net on the sidewalk that embellished the style established at the Paris Fashion Week.
Unthinkable trends dominated Instagram that summer and these designers poured their creative eyes into the underbelly of the fashion industry.
Valentino's product was a top hat worn with a hair that dominated the heads of the designers.
Other major supports included a decorated hat, a hat and a strawberry - but they were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also packed a selection of amazing masks - and only for the Halloween season.
Many of the colorful facials have a silk-on-the-lip pattern and look more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One was like a scuba diving kit with a snorkel and a plunger, and the other was like a melting milk pipe.
And if you keep on being a great fan of jewelry - you are successful.
Fashion viewers are wary that large bonnets may begin to spread to the major streets around you.
The large hats come in handy on the long 'La Bomba' shoes, a folded hat with two short sleeves seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The highly-loved hat was widely circulated on social media sending a huge innovation to the fashion industry - to a beach bag almost as big as a model of a swimsuit worn in water.
The orange bag, decorated with a top-side raffia of a white leather suitcase, was a highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think seeing big hats and beach bags come to the main street for the next winter - because because the designer made a big impact it would be hard to forget the demand for her big support products.
John Edward: The Importance of Language Skills for the Citizens of the World
Scottish private schools maintain a record of excellence in academics, and this continued in 2018 with a section of outstanding examination results, which is only promoted by individual successes in sport, art, music and other social activities.
With an additional 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, supported by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, are committed to providing a better working environment for young children and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their children for further education, the way of life they choose and their status as global citizens.
As a field of knowledge that can design and implement the school curriculum in question, we see modern languages increasingly emerging and a desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to someone in a language they understand, it's a mind-boggling thing.
When you speak to him in his language it enters his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
From the results of recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest grades in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages obtained a Master's degree.
The data, compiled from 74 SCIS school members, showed that 72 percent of students had a High A grade in Mandarin, followed by 72 percent of those who read German, 69 percent of those who read French and 63 percent of those who read Spanish.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject of choice, held in the same position as STEM (science, engineering and mathematics) courses in private school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that employers' reasons for struggling to fill gaps were attributed to a 17 percent language skills deficiency.
So the wisdom of multilingualism is becoming even more important in preparing young people for the future.
With the increasing workload available to those who need languages, these skills are essential in a complex world.
Regardless of the career choice of a person, if they learn a second language, they will achieve a wise future benefit by living such a long life:
Having the opportunity to communicate directly with people from foreign countries would directly put a multilingual person on top of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to communicate and French being the only spoken language and a percentage of a single two digit digit number, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language learning now is beneficial for children in the future.
Having multiple languages, especially those of the developing economies, will give children a better chance of getting a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will have a different language of instruction.
While most schools will focus on more prominent modern languages, others will teach languages considered more useful for English in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter how interested your children may be, there will always be a language selection from private schools, with teachers who are experts in the area.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children who lack the strength of wisdom needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to play a useful role in the future of the country, so it is necessary to include this in knowledge.
Of course, modern languages should literally be considered international communication technologies.
Private schools will continue to provide this option, to live with each other and to stand out to young people in Scotland.
It must be well done.
John Edward was the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make the Lakers appear Sunday in San Diego
Waiting was almost over for fans who were looking to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening game of Sunday's opening season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he just doesn't know how long he'll be playing.
"It will be more than one and close to a 48" Walton machine on the Lakers' website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably be the one to set the tone for the game.
After the first test of the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six-game schedule.
"I don't need my pre-game at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
During the Trump Summit in West Virginia, the YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump has started a few more meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump meetings over the next week that included standing ovations in friendly areas opposite Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the confirmation vote that elected him to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of the legislature in time for the November election.
When is Trump's West Virginia nightly meeting and how can I watch online?
The Trump Summit in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. today Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia meeting online below when it's on YouTube.
Trump is not surprised to speak on the ballot this week for the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, which has been pushing for a repeal of the sexual assault ban with the hope of a Senate vote stayed for another week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of the forum was to help Republicans facing the November elections get some energy.
So President Trump's campaign said the goal of the five meetings over the next week was to "pull the votes of the volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in both the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
Congress management is crucial to his agenda that the president will visit many states while we are in the absence, said a Trump campaign spokesman who told Reuters but declined to be named.
The plan for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight will bring fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media to Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia last month, a state that won more than 40 percent of its total in 2016.
Trump was trying to help Republican Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is behind in the election.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that until the president comes to try to add some popularity to him in the election", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show signs of struggle to promote the aspirations of a Sunday singles player
After the opposite-sided sessions, Saturday's quarter-finals may just be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The change in mood of a year is a game in general but one that athletes truly believe in, and has never been so until in competitions like these.
So where would they say the challenge is now?
"They used to have a six-point lead and now they're four, so we consider that a little bit of a bump in my mind", Jordan Spieth said as he finished for the day.
Europe had a win, in fact, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a little bit helpful in the matter although they have a lot to encourage them, at least not the Spieth and Justin Thomas team who played together all day and each got up three out of four.
Spieth was poison from tee to green and led by example.
These feasting cries were rife as his surroundings continued, drowning an important piece for four square feet while he and Thomas were both killed two after the other.
His attempt to win the game on the 15th day where he encountered a similar outcry, which suggests to you that he believed that the American team was not part of that.
"You have to actually get really low and worry about your game", Spieth said.
He's all one of those players gone now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more goals than Spieth and Thomas in more than two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a Ryder Club short story.
The European marriage is a popular but popular tradition and four out of four couples will never do anything wrong.
Moliwood became the only two to shoot a shark on Saturday afternoon but also avoided the conspiracy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and after nine on Friday morning.
That is over, and how much energy passes entirely from the arrival and the public platform that they have promoted that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more player to cover a European victory as the sun rises on top of Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
If desired, all at once in different holes.
The theme of European glory is still unknown.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball champion, in a short role when they were paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and a double-crossed bogey on the front of a Spanish and Swedish excavator in a pit that never got close to the exit.
On Sunday, though, no one would help you out of your hole.
The four goals and the four ties are interesting at least from close range because of the interaction between the two ties, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a big way.
Europe have played well as a team so far and have become the leaders on the final day but this fourth quarter also shows that Team USA is pregnant for the war that, especially the Stateside, they have done with hesitation.
Europe leads 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a useful advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after advancing from Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 lead in the United States.
The bold pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the change and won two victories over Tiger Woods who were struggling to take the number one ranking so far at Le Golf National to four-point field goals.
European side Thomas Bjorn, the cup-holder unsuccessful two years ago at Hazeltine, had taken a further loss to the US side in the morning four-ball, taking 3-1 downs.
The United States added a draw in the quarter-finals, winning two games, but lost the tournament.
Jim Furyk's team needed a set of items from Sunday's 12 individual games to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four goals in a season against Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a weekend in question and the only pair to score four goals from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four goals, they then rose to beat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and her other 5-4 appearance.
Woods, who pulled himself into two games on Saturday, showed an academic showing but now lost 19 of his games in four goals and four-fourths and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for four goals in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a four-way tie for a 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - a record one and three in the world.
Europe did not have as easy a southeast windy day as Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a line for the Americans with two goals on Saturday.
They scored a disappointing 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm Ian Poulter in the four-hole and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the four-hole after losing the win by opening both holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup did a team come back from a four-point loss in singles, although as the holders of the Furyk division required only a standing horse to hold the cup.
After being the second best for two days, however, another attack on Sunday seemed to outstrip them.
North Korea says it cannot reduce its weapons alone without security
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were increasing its distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would leave its nuclear weapons alone under any circumstances.
Ri Yong told the World Trade Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "respectful steps" in the past year, such as halting its nuclear and missile tests, destroying its nuclear testing site, and pledging to not increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, we don't see any response from the United States", he said.
Without any American confidence there will be confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we alone will reduce our weapons first.
When Rike found himself repeating South Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's refusal to follow a "reasonable" approach to reduce nuclear weapons under which to be donated to the Arian nation, while taking some measures, his speech was significant because it did not refuse to reduce nuclear weapons alone as Pyongyang had done previously.
Ri was looking at a joint speech by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between a former US president and a North Korean president in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insisted that Pyongyang should abandon its nuclear weapons from the outset.
Washington also rejected my calls to relax national sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has been committed to nuclear non-proliferation from the beginning and has increased the level of sanctions to achieve its goal in a compelling manner, as well as to the end-of-war rhetoric, Ri said.
Fahimta said that restrictions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who are curious about us.
But the problem is that continuing restrictions increase our disapproval.
Ri did not comment on preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US president had commented on at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister commented on three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: If the country involved in this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea, it would be said that the United States and the Korean nuclear disarmament have not had the same problem
However, Ri's rhetoric was somewhat different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that in the US territory and the Korean appeals were something that would have to be made after the "President of the Disaster Investigation Team" called Kim and another "missile man" who was trying to commit suicide.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his steadfast stance on disarmament, but said there was still work to be done and sanctions were still in place until North Korea withdrew from nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time for this, saying If it takes two, three or five years - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: The Security Council's sanctions must be enforced fully and without fail until we finally see the full extent of the nuclear abandonment.
The Security Council has generally tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly where he said that afterwards he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times since earlier this year, but his visit was not very pleasant.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, only in the hours North Korea had ignored the demands of the pirates.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to demolish a missile test site and a nuclear facility if the United States takes some steps toward the end.
He said Kim told him "some side steps" he was seeking were Trump's promised security guarantees in Singapore and a move toward a more balanced relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a class on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep in a way that reduced the size of the literacy tradition by drinking coffee  all night.
One teacher found that students at one of the world's top universities are usually ignorant of the basic issues of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
His attention was drawn to the course after he gave a talk on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally one girl came up to me and said: Why are we told this now, in my final year?
She said no one had ever told her about the benefits of sleep - which surprised her", she told The Telegraph.
The course was first held this year, where students were explained the benefits of good sleep habits for learning and skiing, and even for overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, said the university decided to launch the course after finding that students were severely restricted from sleeping during the week.
The hour-long program includes a series of discussions.
In one section there was a chapter of a bedroom, where students pressed down cups of coffee, brochures, trainers and books to be told the effects of light and light and how the work of skiing affects sleep deprivation, and the usefulness of the ritual of what to do when sleeping.
In one department, visitors were told how sleep deprivation over long periods of time could increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and stroke.
A school map, with interactive signs, then encourages the participants to reflect on their daily activities.
We know that he will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health risks of choosing to smoke, Professor Czeisler added.
The tradition of overnight sleeping still persists, he said, adding that modern technology and the continued pressure on students means sleep deprivation is becoming a major problem.
Ensuring adequate, good, sleep should be a student's secret weapon for increasing depression, fatigue and anxiety - or to avoid becoming obese, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of malnutrition, constantly making them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemist and physicist, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking one of the shortcomings of his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and attracted attention so that the course could be moved across the school.
Hoping for the next step, he would ask all graduate students to complete the same coursework before entering a competitive school.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should be careful to set a bedtime and even wake-up alarm, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "light exposure" from the faces of electronic devices and LED lights, which can put your health system to sleep in a certain environment, leading to sleep deprivation problems.
Livingston 1 and Rangers 0: Menga's defeat humiliates Gerrard's men
The Rangers were relegated when Dolly Menga's attack reduced Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 draw at Livingston.
Ibrox side were looking to produce their first goal on the road since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but the team was beaten by Gary Holt for only the second time in 18 games as manager where he left his side with eight goals in the ruins on the way to Ladbrokes' premiership-winning Hearts.
Menga had hit seven minutes before halftime and a short line hit by the Rangers on the attraction never looked like a flat.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed up to third and only behind Hibernian on a score of difference.
And there may be more violence left for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence has been treated for another injury after something was obviously thrown from the end of the pitch.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that knocked Ayr out of the play-offs before the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the Livi 11 version which had removed the title from Hearts a week earlier and had been delighted with how his own trainers had been harassing their opponents in each edition.
The Rangers may have been a great team, but Livingston did a lot with the ball.
They should have won only two minutes of the first game during Menga's first exchange to send Scott Pittman to win Allan McGregor but the centre-back extended his chances considerably.
A further unstoppable Keaghan Jacobs goalkeeper was Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to extend the position behind.
The Rangers were still in control but there was a sign of more optimism than agreement about their games in the final three.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given a shot in the head and then a goal in the third half as he and Steven Lawless faced off but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombia complaints.
The Rangers tried to hit just the first half of the second on the offensive but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly showed no concern from Lassana Coulibaly's head-stroke and another fast-forward attack by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's 34-minute opening was on the play-by-play, no one could deny that they were eligible for their only meal.
The Rangers were unable to cope with another attempt by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond where Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who was cold-hearted to take Menga for a minor finish.
Gerrard worked his way through the season where he replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent and the change almost immediately produced another impact as a cornerback for the offense you had against Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston continued to draw the visitors to the exact game they were enjoying, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball up in the air behind a long ball.
Holt's side had extended their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood firmly and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow struck you out of the game.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton received a final bid for a penalty where he tried with Jacobs but Thomson turned away.
Almanac: The author of Geiger Counter
And now it is another page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years today, is also CALLED TO BE ... the date of the birth of the future geologist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger built a method to detect and measure the steam activity, a disadvantage from which led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A science fiction novel since then, Geiger Counter has become a staple in popular culture, where in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", mysterious scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear in the stars:
Man: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: "It is the Geiger Counter, used to find raw materials, such as uranium.
When you wear these hearing aids, you can actually feel the chemical reactions of the atomic reaction produced by the vapor in the raw material.
Evans: "Say, he's coming out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the one who used his name was alive.
A new cancer shot could teach the body's immune system to detect the problem cells
The new cancer vaccine could teach the body's immune system to detect and kill the damaged cells
The injection trains the body's immune system to identify the problem cells as part of the treatment
The methods include extracting immune cells from a patient, testing them in a scientific laboratory
They can then see a nutrient that most snakes know and then re-enter
One test shot has shown positive effects on patients in a different stage of the disease.
One woman who had undergone a surgical procedure and trained her immune system to detect the affected cells found that her uterine cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, where they are modified in a laboratory laboratory to detect a protein known to many cancers as HER2, where they are reinserted into the cells.
"Our results suggest that there is a vaccine", says Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Academy of Neurology in Bethesda, Maryland.
According to Professor Berzofsky, HERS "reduces the size of a variety of cells", including the breast, uterus, lungs, and jaw.
The same method was used to remove cells from the patient's body and "train" them to attack cancer cells and was effective in treating the original form of the disease.
Kanye West began to criticize Trump's opponents, wearing a MAGA dress, after his appearance on SNL.
He Was Not Right
Kanye West was yelled at in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a loud shout in which he praised the President of the United States. Donald Trump also said he would seek a stay in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he passed out shouting at the Democrats and emphasizing his support for Trump.
"I spoke to a white man several times and they said, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I had worried about race I would have left the United States already", he said.
SNL first aired a comedy-drama starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, a short video of West's performance was uploaded on social media by Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to justify West's actions.
Moreover, West complained to the audience that he had suffered behind the scenes over what was his own.
"They persecuted me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Do not go out there wearing a hat.'
They were oppressing me!
And they said I was a green man", he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
"I'll wear a hat for an adult, because it means you won't tell us what to do.
Try love".
His comments attracted at least two times the audience's attention and members of SNL showed disgrace, according to Variety, with one person there telling the publication: "The studio is completely silent".
West was conceived as the final replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by performing a song Ilove it, which he wore like a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TRUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the heroes: WE WILL DANK YOU RISE FOR YOUR WRIT and TRY".
But host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that just West "is the way he is and that's very interesting".
"But I chose not to give gifts to anyone (by buying his music or his products or showing support for his "wisdom") who I believe is spreading and promoting a belief that is harmful to my people.
He was free.
"So is the Bible", she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced via Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "someone who used to be known to me as Kanye West".
He was not the first musician to change his name and follow in the footsteps of his band Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His brother rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lion and then the famous singer Prince, changing his name to a brand and singer formerly known as Prince.
Charged for attempted murder with a knife in a Belfast grocery store
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a food court in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Government Prosecutor's Office will renew the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes the idea of youth
Kit Harington is known for portraying the role of Jon Snow in the HBO horror-thriller series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old filmmaker criticized the male protagonist, saying that the genre meant that young children often felt like they had to be inferior before being respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something wrong happened' and asked how to address the problem of the stigmatization of male sexism in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, says that he feels "very strong" about dealing with the issue.
I felt in my body, very strong, at that moment - where did we go wrong with the idea of a giant man?' he said.
In view of the current situation, what do we teach men as they grow up?'
Kit believed television would be a legitimate source of this male-dominated development because of the male-dominated athletes being cast.
He continued: What is the human body and what is it taught?
What is the message on television and in the streets that makes little children feel like they have to be on the side of someone?
I feel that this is one of the most important questions of our time - how can we change this?
Because something is obviously wrong with the young men.'
In an interview he also confirmed that he would no longer be making Game of Thrones when the series concludes in the coming winter, saying he had 'done off the battlefields with horses'.
From November Kit will appear in a reboot of Sam Shepard's True West which is a tale of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief with an armed weapon.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that ever happened to him from Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in this program, so in this way he gave me my future family, and life would begin here.'
Rose appeared in Ygritte, Kit's romantic comedy-drama adaptation of Jon Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning film.
The couple married in June 2018 in the backyard of their home in the Leslie family in Scotland.
CHORUS/FUID: China reports a 14 percent increase in new infections
China has reported a jump in 14 percent of its population living with measles and multiple sclerosis.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to health officials.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A large proportion of new infections are sexually transmitted, a trend that has changed since then.
Traditionally, the epidemic was spreading rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV through this method has dropped to almost zero, health officials say in another nine in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and immunodeficiency disorder in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of sexually transmitted infections is a major issue in the gay and lesbian community in China.
The ban on homosexuality was lifted in China in 1997, but the discrimination against homosexuals and homosexuals was said to be minimal.
Because of the country's conservative culture, studies have suggested that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease comes from a lack of adequate sexual protection in these interactions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to have a global outreach to AIDS as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that her employee had leaked GOP senate records, calling them "bad lies" and "hypocritical issues"
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed the rumors that a member of her staff had posted the private profile of three Republican U.S. senators on the members' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic newspaper confirmed that it was a fiction by some "religious thinkers" who were spreading it among the spiders.
Lies, lies, and more serious lies, Waters posted in a Twitter post.
The release of the statement said it included home addresses and phone numbers for the United States Senate. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The statement was posted online on Thursday, by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh who was nominated to the Supreme Court.
The Yoyon came a while after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the exit foot was linked to the Waters office", which released information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
This baseless myth is a complete lie, Waters goes on.
The mystery of my ministry - whose testimony, privacy, and protection were dissolved as a result of these lies and myths - was not the cause of the spread of this information.
This unfounded myth is a lie and a complete lie".
Waters' speech drew criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This is a very offensive statement, Fleischer writes.
This indicates that she is not a candidate for Parliament.
If someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be offended.
They will not have to commit.
They would not have to question the accused's motives.
They need to be calm and calm".
Fleischer was speaking in reference to Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too upset during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate seeking Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Not if it's true", he tweeted.
In her speech, Waters said her office had alerted her "to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these corruption complaints.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified, she continued, "and will be held accountable for all their acts that are disruptive and harmful to everyone and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Reviews - Rowan Atkinson the most powerful spy
It is now a tradition to look at the benefits of Brexit in every film with a British actor and that does not mean it will run for this revival of Johnny English's comedy - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived live in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a self-deprecating question of the obvious conspiracy to claim that we are the newly imported country?
In any case, the eye came to the rubber face of Johnny English who could not get his license to design new things for a second time - this name reflected more than anything that he was a wide-ranging game designer designed for movie theaters in non-English speaking areas.
He was indeed a foolish spy despite the fact that his style of displaying a brand for ease of decoration was inspired by Clouseau's son, a colleague of Mr. Bean and a work by this man who contributed as a single text to the soundtrack of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
And it was also a classic on the travel and international superhero Atkinson had once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving a vibe in his wake.
There are one or two beautiful features in this latest release of JE.
I loved the way Johnny English approached a helicopter when he wore a suit of armor and a rotor knife on his plate cap.
Atkinson's artistic talent is presented in a physical way, but comedy seems to be less intense and more convoluted, especially when viewed as well-known "uncommon" films such as the 007 series and Mission Impossible themselves are now boldly producing comedy as their own style.
The laugh seemed to be more to be attributed to children than adults, and to me the horror of what Johnny English saw was not that they were being a little bit of a joke and that they were experiencing Atkinson's grin in Bean's character.
The argument is that Great Britain is in a state of turmoil.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a British intelligence agency's online network, exposing the testimony of all British agents in the sector, embarrassing the working agent - a minor problem that is felt to be frustrated by Kevin Eldon's small role.
It was the final strain for a self-conscious and racist prime minister, already suffering from a political bloodlessness meltdown: Emma Thompson did what she could with this kind of attitude that was not Teresa May's but nothing much in the process.
Her secret counselors told her that almost every spy had been robbed, and she had to bring in one of the retired.
And that means Johnny English himself, now working as a schoolteacher in a good employer, but leaving lessons in how to become a spy: some pretty gags here, as English produced a spy study of some kind.
English was pulled back to Whitehall for an emergency report and reconnected with his former assistant Bough, who was shot in the leg by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a ship captain, a kind of uncomfortable role in which Vicki Pepperdine becomes a bit of a waste of time.
So Batman and Robin make a terrible mistake on the Queen's Intelligence Service returning to work, meeting the beautiful problem of the woman Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Right now, the prime minister is failing in danger under the control of a billionaire technologist who claims to solve Britain's computer disaster: the sinister Jason Volta, sung by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began to look at their systems: hiding as waiters, setting fire to a lighthouse in a French restaurant; creating noise where they relaxed themselves through the pleasure of a Volta boat; and English encouraging lawlessness where he tried to use a Virtual Reality machine to understand himself and the Volta family.
All the stand-up comedies were actually drawn for the final series, but despite its beauty and size, there was a children's TV about the whole thing.
A balanced system.
And with the rest of Johnny English's films I can't help but wonder: why wouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would actually do justice to his intelligence?
Labour has refused to offer a four-day weekly wage for British workers
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will look at a major scheme that would see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid five days.
According to reports the party wants the company's leaders to hand over the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
He would see the workers enjoying a three-day break - yet still receiving the same pay.
The media said that wisdom would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a worker's preference.
The move to another four-day week was approved by the Labour Party as a way for workers to benefit from economic reform.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "The resolution is expected to be reviewed before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight but a four-day workweek is a suitable attraction in the party's approach to economic re-establishment for the worker and even the party's overall strategy towards industry.'
Labour will not be the first to adopt such a view, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party is now showing little confidence in the overall attractiveness, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek was not a party decision and the party considered it".
A small critic John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to express his vision for a revolutionary socialist ideology in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was ready to seize power from "secret managers" and "profits" in public companies.
The small-scale schemes also mean that investors now in water companies are unlikely to get a full return on their investment because a Labour government could make 'reductions' on grounds that are considered inappropriate.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in the corporate board and create Private Equity Accounts to give 10 percent of the equity of the business sector companies to employees, who could earn annual profits up to almost 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's fictional investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on who was nominated to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raised questions about whether the agency's findings would draw any Republican senators to their side.
In an interview played on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could get anything to change their minds.
Kennedy described him as more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, the Kennedy machine.
"I said I would go into the auditorium, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the fire had broken out, and said, 'Did you do that?'
It was firm, ready, and unshakable".
Graham's choice, however, seemed to be planned.
"My heart was set on Brett Kavanaugh and he would take another serious charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it so badly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever mentions it cannot determine it.
It was 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing".
What Is a World Day, and Has It Helped to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will mark the anniversary of the International Patriotic Festival, an annual music festival that has a profound effect on the stars who will also serve an exciting mission; ending poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Patriotic Festival will see tens of thousands of people rally to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy athletes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the reality of the festival's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The International Citizens' Day, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Action, an international organization that hopes to end poverty by raising the number of people who are struggling to cope.
To receive a free ticket for the service (unless you want to pay for a senior ticket), the concertgoers must complete a series of activities that they have already accomplished, or "works" of volunteerism, email a world leader, make a phone call or any other means of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how did the success of the International Cities come to be in the 12 years that remained before its goal was achieved?
Is the wisdom of giving people a free concert a good way to attract people to a call to action, or is it just a form of "clicktivism" - people feel like they're really making a difference by signing up for a blog post or posting a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Citizens for the World has said it has collected more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters, pushing forward various goals.
He said that these projects have helped to attract the attention of world leaders to announce promises and resolutions worth $37 billion that are set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people worldwide by 2030.
In early 2018, the group brought in 390 promises and announcements from its operations, where at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The gang's profits directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include Nutrition Power, a British-based coalition of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow up to be fully capable", and a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from Nationals of the World.
With the support of UK government donors, donors, national governments, and just Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a historic event, Nutrition Force ambassador Tracey Ullman told a public meeting during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking over 5,000 jobs calling on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Nutrition Strength, which would reach 5 million women and children and support nutrition supplies.
In response to one of the questions posted on her website, she asks "what makes us think we will end extreme poverty?"
The citizens of the world respond: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fail.
But like the great struggle for civil liberty and the struggle against racism that has come before us, we will win because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers to perform at this year's festival in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy to "block" to prevent the release of Lost Materials - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke speculated that Russia's entry into Syria - that is, where it is said to have worked at the invitation of a well-known government - was a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to have energy as much as they did in Eastern Europe, the southern interior of Europe", the report said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and strategies to deal with it.
"The United States has the power, with our navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if caught, to base it, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to the audience at a conference organized by the Party of Electrical Users, a nonprofit group that resembles the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared the approaches Washington had taken in its relations with Russia and Iran, since they were similar.
"The economic sector against Iran and Russia is, for the most part, the oil-substitution benefit", he said, referring to Russia as a "commonwealth" with an economy that relies on fossil fuel wheels.
The comments came as the Trump administration since it began working on a policy to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replaced Russia, the cheapest option for consumers in Europe.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump said made Berlin Moscow a "prison".
Moscow further stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, set to double the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a real economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was economically motivated and set an example of a misguided game.
"I think we have the view that energy will not be a single pressure tool if its consumers choose the suppliers", Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US action prompted a reaction from Germany, which confirmed the launch of the project.
The German industrial union, the German Industrial Confederation (BDI) has called on the United States to suspend the EU's energy policy and the Berlin-Moscow cooperation agreement.
"I have a big problem with the third state interfering with our energy", said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German President Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will make a "good review" of the 2020 Presidential Campaign, Massachusetts Senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "take a good look at her presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our government's failures and that includes women in heaven", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will look closely at running for president.
Warren has accused President Donald Trump of running the city council, saying he is running the country in an unfair manner.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has long been critical of Trump and his Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We really need to investigate the FBI before the election".
A polling result released on Thursday, however, showed that most Warren County residents did not expect to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' residents said the House of Representatives would not run, according to the Suffolk University Poll/Boston World Poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The election results showed the most support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the potential candidate and 48 percent against him.
Some of the Democratic Party's top candidates discussed the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Congressman Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Launched the PTSD Track Palin at the Donald Trump Summit
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
My son's condition, what he's recovering from, I can relate to other families who feel threatened by PTSD and some of the injuries that the military recovers from, she told the crowd at the Donald Trump Summit in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her imprisoned Giwa in the room and said that on her son and other soldiers of war, they returned in a different situation, they had a return with dismay, they returned in the minds if there was such a respect that their fellow national and high-ranking military, and any other security party had given to his country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference in a riot on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, a Wasilla Police Officer.
18 states, D.C., support the challenges of the new asylum system
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported legal challenges to the new U.S. Constitution banning asylum from domestic violence and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court case on Friday, in Washington in support of the asylum seeker's challenge to the system, NBC reported.
The full name of the Plaintiff in Grace v. The August lawsuit brought by the American Civil War Association against the federal government was not resolved.
She said her friend and her controversial children, who were gay, abused her but the US authorities denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was kidnapped in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace have compared El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide many asylum seekers in the United States, as states facing a number of problems with domestic violence and violence.
The new asylum system overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Commission that allowed undocumented domestic violence refugees to seek asylum.
In a statement Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine said that the new policy "does not address decades of struggle, federalism, and international law".
Federal law requires that any claim for asylum be decided on the merits of the case and, such a rope violates this principle", the court's counsel said.
The authorities have continued to emphasize that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the US economy is detrimental to their ability to become businessmen and "provide adequate employment".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration authorities not to provide any more asylum to victims of domestic violence and the corruption crisis in June.
"Available asylum is for those who have fled their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, ethnicity, or representation in a political party or opinion", Sessions said in a June 11 policy announcement.
Giving refugees will not solve all the problems - or even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Emergency rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll increases in the rescue effort
For the living, the situation is worse.
"It's violent", says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby in a foster home in Palu.
Every minute, a ambulance carries bodies.
Here is the pure water.
Their inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, extracting the products from the water, and trying to estimate whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting behind Palus Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the severity of the incident.
He wept as he remembered the earthquake that shook his hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter.
We don't have time to save ourselves.
"Haris told The Associated Press", I thought, "and he added that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her or her daughter.
I think they're fine.
US ambassador accuses China of 'abuse' with 'advertising propaganda'
A week after a Chinese newspaper used four pages a day to criticize U.S.-China trade relations, however, the U.S. Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of using American media and spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday indicated that China is paying daily bills to the Des Moines newspaper - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after China was accused of trying to interfere in the November 6 presidential election, a charge China denied.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election suggests that US officials told Reuters that it was a new initiative by Washington and the US to pressure China.
It was appropriate for foreign governments to introduce advertising to promote trade, with Beijing and Washington locked in a trade war effort that led to a higher level of revenue on each.
China's first response to tariffs in a trade war was to launch industries that would break down states like Iowa that Trump's Republican Party supporters, China and the United States have argued.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural equipment to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary on Sunday in the Des Moines Report, "is now declining on this abuse by using propaganda in free newspapers".
"In propaganda, the Chinese government is contributing to the creation of American culture of free speech and press freedom by paying for advertising in the Des Moines Newsletter", Branstad said.
He added, "In a Beijing library, you will find noises that can hinder the understanding of the different perspectives that the Chinese people are facing of economic distress, because the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China", he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused the offer to publish" his story, although it was not specified which newspaper.
Their Republicans' Split on Women Voters Before the Revolution With Kavanaugh Debacle, Observers Warned
Many of the leading Republicans stood firm and defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as he faced allegations of sexual abuse, with observers warning that they would see interference, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The atmosphere around this was great, and most Republicans were in the process of expressing their desire to continue voting.
These things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill of an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake of (R-Arizona) in the final round of the FBI investigation could be a catalyst for voter anger.
"Women will never forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the Women's Action Group on Friday, according to The Washington DC Times.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber as Republicans who were in charge of the Judiciary Committee voted to continue Kavanaugh's presentation despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic's inspiration.
"Democratic interest and motivation will go out in the message", said Stu Rothenberg, a political reporter, told the website.
"People say that he has already been in heaven, and that is true.
But it can be higher, especially among women's voting groups, in rural areas and among the majority of voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like a leader, will not vote".
Even before Ford's testimony was made public about her allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court, commentators expressed support for the move if the Republican Party continued to testify.
"This was a major crisis for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Federal Reserve Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee election or the last election or Kavanaugh being put on the bench, but about how Republicans have handled this and how they have handled her", Guy Cecil, director of Priority America, a support group for voting Democrats, told the news outlet.
However, Americans were divided over who to believe after the appearance of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, with little influence over the length.
A recent YouGov poll showed 41 percent of respondents doubted whether or not they believed Ford's truth, while 35 percent were sure or not they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied when he testified, while only 30 percent said the same thing as Ford.
Following the firing from Flake, the FBI investigated the incident and Ford was presented with a single suspect, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and sworn last week that Kavanaugh was drunk when he allegedly raped her at age 17.
Ramirez alleged that the elected Superior Court judge exposed his sexuality to her while attending a party while attending Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new website on the Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a campaign that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The state-of-the-art technology company Inrupt is a company that is building the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Mines allow users to choose between storing data and what people are allowed to access.
In a special interview with Fast, Berners-Lee joked that the reason for creating Inrupt was "world power".
"We don't have to do it now", he said of the beginning.
"Now is the time of history".
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online database" or POD.
It includes a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library and other personal tools and instrumentation skills.
It's similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on the same browser surface all at the same time.
The amazing thing about self-storage in an online store is that the user has full access to that kind of information.
The company called it "an encouragement by the data collected".
The vision of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring the resources, structure and convenience to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security system acquired by IBM, several other developers working on the project, and his team of coders.
Starting this week, tech makers around the world will be able to create their own distributed ledger using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee explained that he and his colleagues were not "concerned with Facebook and Google about whether they would introduce a change where all their business models would go through overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's goal is to provide business and event power to help protect the integrity and quality of building a new Solid website".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet again when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Within a few months, Berners-Lee was a leading voice in the debate over inequality.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee would have been the founder and executive director of Web Analytics, the Web Foundation and the Data Center Buddies.
I have a very positive outlook for this modern web revolution, berners -lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross awarded to the teacher
The cathedral church once won the Victoria Cross during World War I and the faithful celebrated their 100th anniversary in their hometown.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 at the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, and he did not know that he had won the British army's highest award.
A memorial stone to him was unveiled on a fence in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday by two of his grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "a fine symbol" that would describe the 100-year-old stone as a gift from his grandfather.
According to the London Chronicle, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his forces across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very disturbing and very dark fog to fire from the field with machine guns".
He then climbed to the line of fire with "her greatest hero" leading the front line before attacking with a rifle alone and knocking down three armies.
On October 4, 1918, Colonel Vann was killed by a German secret agent - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions "are something I know I could never become but something that is humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put a spade behind the curtain, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says that "I really enjoyed the young man for the hard work I did in the race" and adds that he was a hero who was shown the support and support of the people".
MMA fans spent the night sitting down to watch Bellator 206, but then they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, for example, that you have sat down for a night to watch Bellator 206 but have only been prevented from watching the actual program.
The list from San Jose includes 13 fights, including six on the main card and was shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were shocked when the atmosphere changed to Peppa Pig.
Some did not care after a long day of sitting until early in the morning, especially for the evening.
One fan stated on Twitter that the switch to children's comics was like a "sick toy".
"It is a government policy that at 6 a.m. the station should be changed because the program is not appropriate and so they must switch to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, vice president of communications and marketing, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the aleden, yes".
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they would work on plans to connect with British viewers in the future.
"I think if I think about reprinting, I think it might be worth it", says Coker.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there, and we can't do that until our Sunday time, Monday time.
but we are working on it.
Believe me, when it was switched there were messages going back and forth and all of them were uncomfortable.
We tried to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it is not, it is a government issue.
I promise you, that will never happen again.
Believe me, when it was switched there were messages going back and forth and all of them were uncomfortable.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'responsible' because of his race
Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling more elevated than anyone because of his race - but that gave him the talent to succeed.
The 24-year-old admits that he did not realize until he was in high school that "no one is like me".
Speaking at the first talk show of Radio 4 Desert Island hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights and "shedding skin".
And he said that being a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the program, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of illness.
While appearing as a different character on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "lower" than anyone else because "public dislike of men and girls is not allowed".
"To this day", he says, "the feelings of being different and different from myself are the very things that give me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he was not disappointed when his species was discovered.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a major LGBT athlete and used it at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to seek to increase the number of countries that would grant gay rights.
He said that he spoke because he enjoyed being in the public eye without any restrictions and wanted to give others "a skin".
The three-time world champion said that a fight with fellow American athlete Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise".
Daley married Oscar champion, who was 20 years older than him last year but said age gaps were not a problem.
"If you've been through so much at my younger age" - he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it's hard to find someone who's ever had such a position.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that the time frame for his front seat had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the whole question was 'What do I need to win the gold medal?'", he said.
You know, there are some things bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father was not happy that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets to London 2012 - since he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say that you won't get a chance to sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he originally stopped breathing and died before I could accept that he was human", he said.
The year before, Daley had competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just know that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a crowd of locals at the Olympics, there's no better situation", he said.
And he was inspired by his first song selection - Pride by Heather Small - which he had met in the Olympic Games and was a bodybuilder.

The tired Mickelson was sacked for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American footballer Phil Mickelson would set a record on Sunday when he played in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he had to change his format to avoid disappointment as a player.
Mickelson, who was playing in the 12th round, was sacked by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's four-man field goal.
Rather than being in the middle of the game, as usual for the United States, the five-time winner split his day between being a motivational figure and working on his online game with the hope of improving what he had.
Not being stable in the drums or during his career, the 48-year-old was unsuitable for the level of Le Golf's indoor golf course, where he was high for punishment and violent violence.
And if the match itself was not a good fit, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faced British heavyweight champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches that week.
If the Americans, four points down, showed that they would start 12 straight games, get up hot and start the game, Mickelson's game would be a crucial one.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, even though he could not say anything more.
"He realized what he meant today, looked back and put his hand around me, saying he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk recalls.
"He was very confident.
He was a prominent hero and was promoted to the rank of major in that organization earlier, and this week.
I never thought he would be able to play two games.
I expected more, but that's the way it was and that's the way we thought we were going.
He wanted to be out there, like everyone else".
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could end an unprecedented Ryder Cup match at the highest level in history alone.
Mickelson won 18 games, lost 20 and lost seven, although Furyk said his presence brought some important things to the team.
"He was funny, silly, charming, had a lot of people laughing at him, and he was a great player in the theater", he said.
"I think the young players like to mock him, even this week, which is interesting.
It brought more than just a day.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that the long delay would soon pass
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knew from his experience that getting a short break in the last few days of the Ryder Cup individual slide driving was also difficult.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led by five points over the Americans but only managed to finish the line with their noses ahead in the most read distance, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we have a great lead at Valderrama, we have a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only", said Bjorn, who described, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to finish 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Toh Tarihi will show me and everyone in this group that it is not finished yet.
You have a full day tomorrow.
go there and do everything right.
You don't finish this until you find the button on the screen.
We have a purpose, and it is our effort to deliver that cup, and that is where we will be zealous.
I said from the beginning, I was focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we all know what's happening on the other side - they have world champions.
Knowing how these players have done on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go up there myself.
Tomorrow is a different day.
Tomorrow is the next day, and it's a different thing to do.
It is good to be with a partner when things are going well, but if you go out to fight, then you are tested with your full strength as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get to the players, is to get your ball rolling tomorrow.
Now, leave your friends behind because he must get out of his own way, and again".
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing scorer Jim Furyk would have asked his players to perform more skillfully than they did in the association, which included Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on the verge of these big leagues in recent times, having been one of the winners at Brookline before they went on to lose as Europe eliminated the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every bad word", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together to the final day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but then you get up and start coming as fast as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medina.
When stress is absorbed in one direction, it puts extreme pressure on these central branches.
We set our standards as best we could and put their people in the way we like, you know, we try to surprise tomorrow".
Thomas was given the opportunity to try to lead Rory McIlroy in the top flight with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half in the same format.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I thought it was covering the whole road", says Bjorn of his constituency.
The new German battleship was delayed again
A new German Navy aircraft carrier was supposed to be launched in 2014 to replace the older Cold War warfare aircraft. but it would not be available until at least the following year due to faulty systems and cost of snow, media reports reported.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, which is leading the new Baden-Wuerttemberg transport, is now suspended until the first half of 2019, according to a Die Zeit news release.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems before delivery halted the project's delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates commissioned by the Navy in 2007 would come as a replacement for the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was understood that they would include a powerful fire station, a basic air and naval weaponry and other modern technologies, such as radar reduction, infrared and sound signalling.
Other important features include a long development period - new frigates should be used up to two years from domestic water stations.
However, the delay further suggests the quality of the warships - which would allow Germany to maintain a large naval force at sea - would be ready by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 Frigate's launch became a sensation last year, when German naval officials refused to launch the aircraft and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss depot in Hamburg.
That was the extra wake that the Navy would return to the shipbuilder after it had arrived.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported "disruptions and scheduling" that made the warship unsuitable for combat.
The Manhaja was a critical fleet as 120 Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were operated by the crew.
It also stated that the ship had a heavy hull that reduced its performance and determined the Navy's ability to improve its future.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" "was as heavy as the German-built ships of the Second World War.
In addition to poor equipment, the cost of the entire project - including training of the workers - is a problem.
It is estimated to have cost around €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates became a major concern in the recent warnings that German naval power was declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, commander of the German Security Council, admitted that the actual vessel was "first to sail when the first of the many aircraft were launched".
The official said the problem was frozen in time, because large old ships were stopped but no liquids were delivered.
He was saddened that none of the Baden-Wuerttembergers had boarded the ship.
Confederation Confidentiality of the secret life of the commonwealth
A recent study in a Scottish castle is aimed at revealing how the common people use the area in hunting for food.
The results of the study are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
Researchers and scientists at the Scottish Trust will follow the clown and soprano pipistrelles with brown and long-eared daubenton horns in the Inverewe Gardens at Wester Ross.
A special audio recorder will be installed at different locations in the product circuit to monitor the overall performance of the product.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile phone research using manual research.
The sound results from experts of all voice recorders can help to determine how many calls a swarm makes and what each species does.
A map and a custom report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a climate consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which residential areas are most important to jemagui and how they are used for each.
This information will help to determine the use of local management activities such as resource management and how best to manage forests of the genus and other species of their genus.
The population of Scotland and other parts of Bithynia has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by building and construction projects that are plagued by tears and habitat loss.
Air and electric lights can be dangerous, as newspapers and other building materials chemicals do, and attacks from domestic animals can be dangerous.
The truth is, Jemgai is not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful to their eyes when it comes to catching meat.
They use the local noise detection system to detect insects and their pathways.
NTS, which has the responsibility of maintaining more than 270 cottages, 38 utility gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes on the responsibility of providing critical infrastructure and infrastructure.
He had ten bugs, a number of searchers, a collection of cottages and sometimes rescues.
The factory also opened Scotland's first single chamber of commerce at the Threave Estate in Dumfires and Galloway, which has eight out of ten Scottish chambermen.
Treasury manager David Thompson said the property was the most appropriate property for the owners.
"Here in Threave we have a good area for churches", he said.
We had old houses, old timber and a good home.
But there is much more about these treasures that is unknown, so our actions on this property will help us to identify some of the things they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of drilling the seeds before the property is managed as the destruction of the women's nest could lead to the deaths of up to 400 of their wives and children, which could potentially destroy the bird population of the area.
The congregation was thus protected from being killed, disturbed, or disturbed or their homes being ransacked.
Elisabeth Ferrel, of the University of Scotland's Department of Dementia, asked for support from people to join in the relief effort.
She said: "We have a lot to learn about the many species of egg and how they grow.
Ronaldo dismissed the rape charge while lawyers were preparing to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape on false news, saying that people want to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that she later paid her $375,000 to cover her mouth on the item, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking through his Instagram video to 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the video as a "fake news"
Let your words be 'Yes, yes, no, no.'
What they said today, it's a fake story, the five Golden Balls said in the camera.
They wanted to promote themselves by using my name.
That is correct.
They wanted to make a name for themselves by mentioning my name, but it was in the process.
"I am a calm person and no matter what", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's defense lawyers are planning to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel on the charges, which they called the "no-evidence report" on the secret-domain allegations, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek a penalty for "harming his moral character", in an amount that is appropriate to the burden of the offense, which could be the most serious human rights violation in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a large room at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the actor's room, where he allegedly raped her in the tens of thousands, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga admitted that Ronaldo fell on his knees afterwards and told her 99%good person who gets the most from 1%.
Their documents claimed that Ronaldo believed that the two had had sex, but it was in agreement.
Mayorga also admitted that she went to the police and was photographed in hospital, but later reconciled in court because she was afraid of retaliation and worried about the public's disdain.
The 34-year-old now tries to turn the tide as she continues to face the pain of what happened.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and that same day he moved to Italian top-flight club Juventus on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever lose car manufacturers
The UK will do as I know it forever if it loses its position as the leader of the car industry after Brexit, Secretary of State for Trade Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would sell temporary work at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker says the impact of the delay on the national border in the case of Brexit no deal could also mean job losses.
The Burnaston factory - which combines Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced around 150,000 cars last year of which 90 percent were exported to other European countries.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see the purchase of the phone in our factory, said Mavin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Some UK automakers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without any criticism of the cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is the carmakers' comments on the risks of access to equipment in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota's handling system is implemented on a gab-to-time system, as parts arrive or another 37 minutes from suppliers from all over the UK and EU of cars called cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border issues that the industry says could lead to delays and insufficient parts.
Toyota is unlikely to hold more than one day of equipment at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so much work will be bought.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's EU-related research plan was originally designed to avoid these investigations to the limit.
"We need to get a deal. We want to get a better deal that gives us the right as I said not only the opportunities we can enjoy right now but also the opportunity to use that right", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The main concern not only of Toyota but also of other furnaces is our basic need to maintain the core of the manufacturing process.
Toyota failed to cut the length of time the job would be sold, but in the long run, they warned that the price would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the spokesperson for the industry co-operative, said their members remain concerned: "In my experience once these projects go they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have put forward a fair and honest framework for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could last for more than a week as the fight against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of the work of special adviser Robert Mueler, who investigates Russian election interference, connections between Trump and Russian officials and the possibility of a presidential impeachment.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, putting Mueller's freedom at risk, has filled Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked to a recording studio over the phone about his relationship with Trump and the possibility of the President being removed by law on 25.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, in a report that he would welcome.
Instead, his meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing with the Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-story FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, which further delayed the Senate election.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sara Saunders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "It's not even set, it could be this week, I think it could be fixed in a week based on all the events going on in the high court.
But we will see and we will continue to report in the press".
Some journalists would object to this statement: Sanders has not delivered a speech at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of a talk was not a problem for the TV audience, "although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are valuable".
She then suggested seeing Trump directly which would increase the media's audience.
"The president did more peaceful Q&A than any president before him", she said, without testifying: "We looked at these numbers".
The speech will be delayed, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions, then it's better to speak directly than with me.
We have tried to do this very hard and you have seen us do it very well in the past few weeks and this will happen in a short speech when you can speak to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he disrupts a meeting or press conference with visiting guests.
It was difficult to cover up the press.
In New York City this week, the president explained why, by making his rightful appearance and by making extraordinary appearances before gathering the press.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working for Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude to the country and their desire to stay post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months away until Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made efforts to meet the costs to be met to meet the needs of EU citizens working in public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to this grandfather's decision.
But the British Government continued to prepare for possible disruptions.
I know this time you must be in a state of restlessness for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize once again how valuable each worker is in his contributions, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, provide valuable experience to strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is a perfect home and we want you to live here".
Christion Abercrombie's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessee Organic company reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
He went straight to the side line and here he fell, Reed said.
Trainees and healthcare staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side of the line before placing it on the bed and returning it for further evaluation.
An officer from Jaha Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrobie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there is no specific information on the type/number of pot damage" and the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore uniformed player, is in his first season with the Tennessee Fighting Irish after transferring from Illinois.
He had five sets on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his grandmother up to 18.
Buyers who exceed the highest level of stamp duty will be charged if they purchase property in the UK
Buyers who exceed the maximum stamp duty will be charged if they purchase property in the UK with extra cash used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme
This move would derail Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The sealing process will affect taxpayers in Britain
Savings expect to rise to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Overseas buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty if they buy real estate in the UK - with additional coins used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to derail Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with a commitment to affordable housing and a commitment to delivering stronger measures.
The sealing process will be on individuals and companies with no UK taxation, with additional funding to support government efforts to address insomnia.
The surplus - which is in addition to the current sealing process, including the measures introduced in the past two years on two houses and the purchase of rent - could be as much as three percent.
The bank expects its turnover to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that about 13 percent of London's new building materials are purchased from British expatriates, the cost of transportation and making it difficult for first time buyers to find accommodation.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time do not live in the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp bill to help young people who own their homes.
He accused the major construction companies of storing high-priced goods by taking land without using it, and urged Mrs May to leave the proceeds on the houses to address "the housing crisis in Britain".
Mr Corbyn announced a plan for planned housing reforms, including a rental scheme and an end to the 'deficit' of emissions.
He also wanted to give the legislature the authority to build houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate the kingdom to restore the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing the ruined market houses.
Britain will be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is easy for non-British residents, and foreign companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For many the dream of owning a home becomes too far off, and the frustration of a bad night's sleep becomes more real".
Jack Ross: 'My main goal was to run Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "purpose" was to become Scotland's coach at some point.
Scot, 42, is delighted to challenge the return of the North-East club, which currently sits third in League One, three points clear of the top flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League.
"I wanted to play for her country.
I got a hat B and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Voice.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden and much with my father as a child, and he had something going on.
This opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in running the organization".
Those who preceded Ross as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid of what these names had established in such a big club, after the war offered Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My biggest loss at the time was 'Can I get the team back to the Fremian League?'
"Because of the structure and the products in this organization, it is not surprising that we are the Wassanin Fremiya", he said.
"It's not easy to get him there, but I can see myself as successful here if I can get the team there".
Ross spent just three years in the management role, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts' training course in sports management.
He also helped Alloa recover to the third tier, and re-developed St Mirren from her role in the Champions League the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he has ever felt when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably confusing", he recalls, accepting Alloa's lead.
"I truly believe that management is more important to me than sports.
It was amazing because I had worked hard, lived a good life, and enjoyed some glory.
But playing can be difficult.
Each week you will experience many things.
I still keep this issue in relation to the challenges and pressures of the job but the management felt right.
I always wanted to run, and now I do, and I feel so happy to be in the bubble for the rest of my life".

The full pint time was 5.30pm on Saturday, the study showed
The heat boosted participation in competing British parks but added pressure on restaurants.
Parks and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July but restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA's business manager, who includes figures, said: "It has continued to shine a lot more brightly against England than expected in the World Cup in July, following a similar trend to last June, when it was 2.8 percent, but most restaurants were more touchy.
The 1.8 percent drop in food sales in June alone was the worst in July.
Drinks and bars have become more powerful with their varieties than restaurants that are on the ground floor.
The food stalls also suffered during the day, but not as much as the restaurant workers.
The people seemed to want to go out and get a drink.
In all the establishments where alcohol and liquor are sold, sales are up to 6.6 percent a month, and food is less than three percent".
Paul Newman, a recreation consultant and RSM professor, said: "These results have been continuing since late April.
The climate and impact of major social events or sporting events have been major factors when it comes to selling at the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, to prevent the drop to 4.8 percent a year because it would be a severe blow to the high-priced pressures they face.
The long-term heat wave could not come at the worst time for food processors like this and the time will fall the more average weather we experienced in August would produce the necessary delay".
Total sales across bars and restaurants, including opening, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the company's exports.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Marketplace tracks UK businesses, local bars and restaurants collecting and analysing economic data from 47 operating groups, an increase of over $9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children has a personal website that they keep away from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a personal website that bullies their parents and teachers, a survey shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase on fake Insta page
The article further honored fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a specific page that they pointed to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has created a website that appeals to adults.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram pages - references and sharing of photos on Instagram.
The article further honored the fear of sexual propaganda.
Twenty percent of the children said they were using a "real" clean page to show parents, while they had a private one.
A mother who went to her 13-year-old daughter's personal website found a teenager begging others to "rape me".
The survey, Digital UK awareness and school principals and Head of Conference (HMC) of private schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18 year olds had two data sets, with half of them confidently having personal pages.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is a concern that many young people are interested in opening websites where their parents and teachers do not find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for players" at the Scottish sports agency
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Sports Authority's board as a junior director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's best runner and other outdoor sportsman and manager Ian Beattie has stated that this is a very good opportunity for those who lead the sport to have the opportunity to use it at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected by the Scottish community, the British and the international athletics community, and we are confident that players in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing her to the committee", Beattie said.
"I am interested in being the voice of the athletes and I hope to contribute and help to the sporting scene in Scotland", Doyle says.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in a total of four Olympic medals and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after battling a short-term blood clot.
He tweeted: Today is the month since I was diagnosed with ALS.
I was unable to walk.
Doctors say that only time can tell whether or not I will recover or to what extent.
It was a grueling task but he fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today he is doing a vigorous exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
A popular breast tattoo that depicts mothers and cattle spreads the idea on the Internet
A breastfeeding company has circulated online and advertising images of breastfeeding mothers and cattle being tattooed.
To mark the launch of what has been described as "the world's first artificial breast tattoo", the Elvie technology company has released a colorful music video to showcase the freedom that the new tapes offer to mothers.
Real mothers danced in the camps to a song that contained the words: "Yes, I shave my head, but you haven't seen the tail" and "If you don't notice that these aren't the tails, they are my tails".
"I was feeding the children, I was feeding him, I was feeding him, I was sucking my wives".
However, the ad, which was published on the company's website, caused controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of submissions, the video received mixed reviews from viewers, with many commenting on the "disgust" of the dairy industry.
It is not advisable to use cows to promote this product.
Like us they should get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from their home after they are born, someone wrote.
Elvie's breastfeeding is going into the mother's coat (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: There is a lot of stress between mother and baby.
but why not use the breast pump advertisement for parents who want to save their children?
Another added: The illustration is meaningless.
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she found the song "pleasant".
"I think that's a wise decision.
my son bought one where I still drink.
I know the machine like a cow.
I was crazy to tell the truth, but I took it for what it was.
"I think that's a very good advice", wrote someone.
Another said: The restaurant is ideal entertainment for women who are teasing (especially in the bakery or toilet) and feel like shanaye.
this is not a complimentary advertisement or a milk company case.
At the end of the video the women's group showed that they were dancing wearing a pump in their breast coat.
The campaign's main focus was on research that found that breastfeeding women felt like rats.
Elvie's coat however, was hairless, wireless or tubeless and wrapped in a breastfeeding shirt, giving women freedom to move, hold babies, and even go outside while they were pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner of ECD and parent commented: Famfon Elvie is a revolutionary product that is well suited to bold and poor presentation.
By drawing a line between the female and the cow we put the breast tattoo and all the challenges in the spotlight, while it shows in a fascinating atmosphere and how to show that freedom and a new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has been in the news.

Hundreds of refugee children gradually headed to a sacred camp on the Texas border
The number of refugee children detained has increased despite the fact that border ties monthly remain unchanged, in part because of the disapproval of the policies proposed by the Trump administration that made it more difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were illegal aliens, and they feared gaining their right to remain in the country by continuing to need children.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other local residents would donate their handmade designs, and information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the council that the agency had arrested several people who sought to support young children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who have their own supporters or supporters are here illegally, and a large proportion of those are criminals.
So we keep following these people", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to expedite the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which is the back standard, according to the organizing staff.
Many would come out by video conference call, rather than personally, to convey their views on the legal process, as a judge.
Those who are deemed unworthy of help will be returned.
Many of their children are in a security home, most of them want to feel anxious or shaken, which can lead to violence or escape attempts, according to organizers and reports from recent programs.
Advocates say that the victims are particularly concerned in homes such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child's struggles are more easily tolerated, given his size.
They added that returning children to the tent city without enough time to prepare themselves or to surrender to their neighbors would add to the frustration that many suffer.
Sham told the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw without delay
In a speech to the United Nations, Foreign Minister al-Moualem called on the refugees to return home, despite the war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the country's forces were out of the country illegally, under the threat of war and terrorism, and would be dealt with as effectively as possible.
They must withdraw without delay and without any conditions, he told the crowd.
Moualem insisted that war and terrorism are almost over in Sham, a place where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, with millions of people homeless.
said Damascus will continue this imperial war until all areas of Sham are cleared of all terrorist groups and all officials present without authorization.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Sham, most of whom train and advise Kurdish and Arab Sham forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the situation had improved their return, and blamed Western countries for "unfair fear" that the refugees refused to return.
"We call on international countries and aid organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
They are political and social.
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be provided until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN officials say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to secede the last major opposition-held territory in Idlib provides a platform for political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish alliance ended a major attack by pro-Russian Shams on the province, home to three million people.
Moualem however stressed that the deal had "clear dates" and expressed hope that the military operation would focus on terrorists with al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be dealt with.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura expects to convene the first meeting of the committee, which includes members of the government and opposition, soon to draft a constitution after the Sham War and open the way to elections.
Moualem issued the terms for the Sham government to join the committee, saying that the parties should "review the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Under this strategy, Mr. Trump will seek re-election for a second term in 2020 unless, as many members of the Liberal Party had hoped, the upheavals and embarrassments ended his presidency before his term.
The unquestioned or controversial will be the most amazing end of leadership ever!
At this point, there is no sign of the viewer's tiredness.
Since 2014, prime time statistics have knocked more than two to 1.05 million households on CNN and nearly three to 1.6 million nights on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow influenced the cable statistics with up to 3.5 million viewers on the night of the main news.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we recognize", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the congressional secretary who became president after the Capitol bombing.
Nell Scovell, former comedy writer and author of Just Parts of Laughter: And Some Unfortunate Gospels on Making a Mockingjay into the Hollywood Men's Club, has a different conjecture.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said she would choose Mr. Trump.
What kind of a child?" she asked.
What, because he made me laugh, Mr. Scovell told us.
There is value in distracting.
Of course, unlike anything on television, news coming out of Washington could determine the outcome of Roe v. Wade, or the possibility of refugees reuniting and the global economy staying strong.
Exiting was a sacred privilege that could only be enjoyed by the chosen ones.
And in that, it's more than being a famous citizen if you see yourself for six hours watching their expert panel discuss the use of deep data by Bob Woodward looking for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket by gymnast Paul Manafort (a very heavy suit,The Washington Post says) and the importance of the raw information, um, the body of Mr Trump and Stormy Daniel.

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a very high sunrise of 80 degrees outside his home in the northern part of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He failed to get himself out of the situation, not to mention Brett Kavanaugh facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's future on the line.
"I remember when we were playing games back in the day when people said, 'This is the beginning of brain learning,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out to be true for them.

Foreign currency fulfills closest to midterm elections for MPs
It is no wonder that 17 Pennsylvania is seeing a lot of money, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional district that brought two governors into a one-seat race.
This new suburban system in Pittsburg included Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb - who won a seat in a district in a special election last summer.
Lamb was running with another Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the former 12th Pennsylvania District, which was closely tied to the new 17th.
The map was redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the boundaries of the old unincorporated districts were united against the Republican Party.
The rally in the new 17th opened the way for a financial competition between the major parties' financial institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in a highly-attended primaries election in March for the 18th Pennsylvania District Assembly.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The politicians gave the Democratic Party a small victory.
The United States Review El Salvador's Prohibition of China, and It Breaks
Liaison officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already witnessed Beijing, with a small wave from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a formal meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired Trump's campaign executives.
The National Security Council has decided to recall senior US relations officials in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on this recent suspension of Taiwan's witness protection, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only nine were studied in El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, economic development support.
The scope of the study, which included bankruptcy and the forfeiture of visas, would have been devastating for the Central American Country, which is plagued by unemployment and homicide.
During the indoor event, North American and Central American officials suspended a comprehensive meeting on security and economic prosperity for the occasion of last year's event which was seen as a step in trying to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, government officials announced that they wanted the convention to continue, effectively ending the sentence against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, in a nod to the introduction of government services to the event, the ambassador said.
And three U.S. delegates returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or any punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the full debate by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss secrecy.
their information was confirmed by an analyst who was close to the government and spoke in secret.
Read the History
The next shoe to be dropped may be that of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible impeachment, which is now well documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller reportedly turned his attention to whether Mr. Trump's campaign was allied with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hand, Mr. Trump will find himself charged with taking responsibility for the coalition, as he plans to return to the electorate, and it may be within hours of him.
There are many signs of question, and I don't mean Mr. Trump's downfall is unlikely - just that of his generation in Europe.
There was a choice between us on both sides of the Atlantic that would affect how long the battle would take us each month.
In 1938, German officials planned a coup against Hitler, when the West rejected him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre.
Their historical record warns of such a problem, and democracy must be run without delay or haste.
Americans have experienced much of this mining fatigue now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who was leading Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since that paper reported that, last year, he secretly advised the president and considered his ineligibility for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times' account was inaccurate.
"How would we respond if the latest investigation of Brett Kavanaugh's F.B.I. investigation was incomplete or untrue - or if it was confirmed in the Supreme Court despite the hefty allegations of sexual assault and the lack of evidence?
And overall, will we vote in the middle for a legislature that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in the long winter.
But I am sure we will not give up, given the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who had once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to play the sabbath on a swastika table.
With this as my legacy, how can I be optimistic about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans was convinced before the Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, where they knew that their victory over the Austrians, after scoring in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season this season to a 2-2 draw against Villarreal but he believed that the Rangers could use that result as a youngster to the big leagues.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is good", says the 31-year-old.
"We started the game with the belief that we could get something and survive by one point
We might have eaten them at the end, but, overall, the horse's ear may have been a good result.
They were better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were better on the side.
The meaning of Thursday is a long night in Europe.
We hope, we can get three points but that will be a difficult challenge because they have a good result in the final but, with the crowd of our fans, I am sure we can push for a good result.
Last year was a difficult one, between my injuries and the changes in the organization, but now there are signs of improvement.
The team dressed well and the children felt so comfortable; the exercise was good.
Hopefully, we can push it now, put last season behind us and win".
Women are sleep deprived of their pension savings
Although the participants of the survey had a clear view of how they would like to be treated, few of them spoke about it to their fellow humans.
Nearly half of the respondents in the survey reported talking to their wives about long-term care.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their siblings about the situation.
"People want family care, but they don't take steps to talk", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Insurance Commission.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your hope that you will be recognized ahead of time.
You work with your counselors and family to discuss where and who to take care of, so these options set the key to determining costs.
Consult a financial advisor: A financial advisor may be able to help you find ways to pay for your expenses.
Your long-term care coverage options may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, a sub-funded financial insurance policy to help cover those expenses or self-insurance and your own expenses.
Bring your legal documents: Execution of legal battles in the past.
Consult a local health care professional to select a person you trust to care for you and to ensure that the specialists meet your needs even if you cannot speak.
Also, consider the legal authority of your lawyer.
You choose one person whom you agree with to decide your finances and to ensure that the expenses are paid even if you cannot afford them.
remember the details: Suppose your elderly parents are in a critical condition and on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and illness?
Write down these details on the shelf so that you can prepare.
"It's not just about money, it's about the doctors", Martin asked.
What are the remedies?
Who would take care of the dog?
you got this plan alive.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to lack of communication, security officials have not received any information from Donggala regency, a region in northern Palu that is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster began.
Here is more information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of the coast on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala is a system of coastal navigation that stretches over 300 miles [180 km] of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi.
The constitution, a national subdivision of the province, appointed an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
They and agriculture are the main economic activity of Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal areas.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the southern tip of Sulawesi.
Paman and Donggala have experienced numerous tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire mountains and earthquakes are common.
Here are some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in western Aceh coast of northern Sumatra on December 26 last year caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western island of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's largest island, causing a tsunami that swept across the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed many small towns and killed about 300 people.
2016: A devastating earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing tremors and panic as people were reminded of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred at that time, but over 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck Lombok Island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in a state of temporary disrepair.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska mayor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of sexual assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic sensitization, with criticism directed at reports of domestic sensitization and, according to a report released by Alaska State Troopers, on Saturday.
According to a police report, if a woman tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took her phone from her
Palin was placed in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and was being handled on a $500 bond deal, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, honestly" when he was sought, network reports.
Palin faces three Class I misdemeanors, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first time Palin had been charged with a felony.
In December 2017, he was charged with the murder of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic crimes, rioting and reporting domestic terrorism, and possession of a weapon while at risk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized for the incident by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her family's feelings for PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Indonesian tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications were disrupted and more deaths were expected in the coming days.
The quake started only in the center of Sulawesi, in the northeastern Indonesian city of Jakarta.
My video was all the time on social media showing when to be effective.
Hundreds of people gathered in Palu to celebrate the tsunami.
Federal prosecutors seeking a death sentence for a NYC terrorist
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people - the state's lowest death penalty for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used domestically-mounted vehicles to conduct attacks on the machine-gun and West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he launched an attack on pedestrians and bicycles on his way in October.
To uphold the death penalty, prosecutors will confirm that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm, according to the plea bargain, filed in the Southern District of New York.
All those considered were to be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, the federal high court charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder for aiding and abetting fraud, mostly by prosecutors in organized crime, and charges of assault and vehicular destruction.
The attack required "serious correction and prosecution", said prosecutors, describing Saipov's view of it as "cruel, cruel and ruthless".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, illness, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina
It has been ten years since the southern district of New York imposed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was sentenced to death in September 2009.
The last time was when the federal death penalty was imposed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple convicted of conspiring for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek, showed ruthlessness in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was pleased with his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had gained confidence after carrying out the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the allegations.
He also demanded that the Isis flag be displayed in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal civil rights activists in Saipov state, said they were "confronted" with the decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the guilty party's life sentence without the possibility of parole will overcome the problems of the common good", Patton says.
Saipov's defense lawyers urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be monitored Brexit talks
Nigel Farage swore an oath to rebel today during a protest at a Tory convention.
The former Ukip chairman said politicians were "in pain" from Eurosceptics' businessmen - as one of Theresa May's representatives suggested that she should consider negotiations with the EU.
A recent supporter, Peter Bone, told reporters in Birmingham that Britain would leave if Mr Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges Mrs May faced in reconciling and leading the various parties in the negotiations suggested that the Pro-Remain Tories were taking part in the Brexit rally in the city.
Fremiya was suffering from management issues and her investigators prepared on the road in attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Friends insisted that she pushed forward with my efforts to reach a deal with Brussels despite the results - and forced the Europeans and Labour to choose between her and 'the revolution'.
Mr Bone told AFP news agency that he wanted to 'look at' 'Investigators'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be a candidate and hand over responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
"If he had been a supervisor, we would have left now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand by Brexit but we need to look at the researchers.'
In opposition to the EU, he said: 'We have not fought world wars to be humble.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone dismissed the fact that public opinion and opinions had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain right is wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was on the trip, reporting: I'm just saying: Frem minister listened to the people.
'The pollsters are not strict with the public, and the Opposition would not vote, without our party and our activists, who have ruined the streets and made us vote from the beginning.
Please download the Searchers and start listening.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: 'Their Prime Ministers continue their work if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told politicians that politicians must start 'heating up' if they want to win the fraudulent 2016 referendum.
'This is now about the question of how between us - the people - and the politicians,' he said.
'They are trying to trick Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you go with this'.
In a message to the happy crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are close to betraying Brexit, feel pain.
'We are gathering the military forces of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we are independent, autonomous and proud of Britain.'
Meanwhile, Remainers toured Birmingham before making a two-hour tour of the city centre
The hardline activist raised Tories' concerns about Brexit after the group was dissolved during the holiday season.
Labour leader Lord Adonis addressed the Conservatives about the security issues they had suffered with the party's applications during the opening session.
These are the people who told us that they can have IT systems in one place and all the technology of the Canadian border, for borderless, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
'It's a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit, he added.
Warren will make a "good study" of the Presidential Campaign
U.S. Senator Elizaberth said she would "make a good analysis of the Presidential Candidate Candidate Candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November between himself and Jaha GOP congressman Geoff Diehl, who was the president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts nomination.
She was at the center of the debate that she might run for President Trump in 2020.
At a Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke which was the 36th meeting with its residents and using the city hall system since Trump took office.
One of the delegates asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to reform our government and that included women above",
Arrested in the shooting of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released the video of the shooting on Friday, seeking help to locate the person in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul said Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, who Simpson shot.
Simpson was questioned and agreed to be there, armed with a gun, and agreed to shoot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident, and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
A 6-foot-6 guard who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the World Cup when athletes give him the chance to win Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' players would play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and even nearly hung Hamilton to dry while defending his position in the top two and invited Vettel to attack the opponent.
Vettel entered the first round and left Hamilton to join the traffic on the tail of the pack, a decision that should have been decisive.
Mercedes crossed the line later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a head-on collision with a Ferrari driver who left him willingly in a good position to hold onto after two attempts to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in the seventh after finishing first on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race while holding the reins to reach the finish line quickly and earn a fourth-place finish ahead of Kimi Raikkonen.
He then entered the field for the 44th time but was unable to improve his strength in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen came fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had worked well all weekend and was modest in his approach.
The team did a good job of getting a first and second place, according to Hamilton.
This is a bad sign
President Donald Trump slammed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a parade on Saturday over her allegations that she had not issued a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a parade in West Virginia, the president gave Ford's address to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead of saying that what was happening in the Senate was a "false lie".
"One thing that can happen and is wonderful is what happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the people who are angry and harsh and dishonest liars", he said.
If you look at the releases and the personal data and they say, "You, I didn't".
I did not.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Remember her answer... did you take out this piece of paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not leave.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we expel it... No, we did not expel it", he added, as the senators pointed out.
Feinstein was also sent a letter containing information about the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and the document came out in early September - but Feinstein denied the allegations that the document came from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Chargin, I didn't release her story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, just as she told me".
But her objection did not indicate that she got involved in the presidential race, who commented during the Saturday night patrol: I'll tell you something, This is a terrible demonstration.
She may not have, but this was the worst physical manifestation I have ever seen".
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court's elected officials, who were accused of sexual assault of three women, the president recommended that the Democrats use the charges to meet their demands.
They were committed to accepting power by whatever character.
You see the evil, the immorality, the indifference to the victims, who will hurt to gain power and power, Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have been fighting off their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were the first team to score two goals through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the stage before Dwyer took over the reins of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the ball that came to the horse's ears against Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals became their victory.
This was the third time the Elite League had lost to the players of Adam Keefe, who later played Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time the two teams had met, with the Giants losing their last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from the help of Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford providing the help and Beauvillier doubling the lead to two four minutes ahead.
A gambler from the start, Sullivan returned their home game into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant in the win over Cownie's horse's ear at 15:16.
Dwyer confirmed that the Giants had led the game in the first period as he scored the second goal of the night at the end of that period.
The team on the ground changed style and Buchard again beat them to a strong football game at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of two games and ensure her victory in the team's fifth group at the end of the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant died to ensure the lives of people on board the plane escaped the earthquake
An Indonesian aviation executive was hailed as a hero after his death for ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people died and dozens vanished after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Small earthquakes with strong intensity continued to be a plague in the area and many people were in turmoil in Palu.
But despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace at the Maniara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He went on to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was attempting to fly at the time, flew safely.
He jumped from the tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a major hospital in another town.
Sadly, we lost him that morning before the coaster arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are filled with the excitement of hearing this story", he said.
Meanwhile, authorities feared that deaths could reach thousands and the country's disaster relief agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong towns was limited.
"There is believed to be a possible increase in the number of deaths since many bodies are under the explosion while the number is not available", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the group.
A waterfall of about six metres damaged Palu, whose bodies will be buried in the same place on Sunday.
Military ships and charter planes were used to deliver relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a dead body is brought by ambulance.
Clean water is hard to find.
Small businesses are being caught everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is coming in a hurry to help those who have survived but we do not know what they will find there.
It's sad, but it can be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the export-related work.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier that year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Niugini says one person has been missing after a plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a letter they released that since Saturday evening, they have not been able to provide a single male account.
The airline said it was working with authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger, such as his age or age
Traditional boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said that on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all were in good health.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remained a mystery.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed on its river bank due to a lack of runway.
Some Witnesses thought the boat had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane crashed into a deep depression.
"That is a good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to sail deep into the water to open the emergency door to the sinking ship.
The crew were confused by the screaming, and he suffered head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said ship operators were working nearby to refurbish the harbor and helped rescue by using a wind-powered boat to transport people to shore before the ship sank to 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Centre indicate that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes over the past two decades but no one has been involved with Air Niugini.
Investigators uncovered the camp during the night the woman was burned alive
The judge suspended his trial on Saturday after a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death was sentenced in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department investigator Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an eyewitness expert in the investigation.
He explained to the jury how he used a cell phone to track 29-year-old criminal Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, who was convicted of the crime, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contrary to previous allegations, Clarion Ledger said.
When reports suggested that his phone was with Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford had a run of marbles on Saturday and testified that he had not been to town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because the car was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
phone records show that they only met in a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", says Hale.
A hearing for his defenders will begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be referred to the judges later that day.
Rapid Sex: What is the popular hip hop genre?
Three other hip hop artists wanted to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
Rapper Sex, from Bristol, claims that hip hop left him with a political message and social problems.
They wanted to go back to their roots and make a popular hip hop act that would restore their status.
Artists such as Fugees and Common saw its resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and LowKey.
A black man?!
NY childcare provider sued a couple on her posting after the "racial" post
A New York nanny sued a couple for unlawful eviction after an unintended text from a mother complained that she was "also a black woman"
The couple denied any racial prejudice, that the case was related to sexual abuse
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two siblings, expressed concern when it was discovered that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black from her arrival on her first day of work in 2016.
aaaaaaaaaaa BUTTER MONTH, said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a note.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, "disgusted" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that her former employee was African-American, had done a bad job and expected to be brought in as a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid her day's wages and then sent home by Uber.
Meanwhile, Maurice is hiring a couple to pay compensation for her eviction, and she is seeking to pay her daughter $350 a day for six months, as was hiring a job she considered unsuitable, albeit without a contract.
"I wanted to show them, look, there's no such thing", she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's because of the prejudice".
The couple responded by saying that we showed no signs of racism, saying that it was the right thing to do, fearing that Maurice would not trust them after committing the crime.
My wife also sent me something that debt meant nothing.
I am not prejudiced.
We are not racist, Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you deliver your children to someone whom you have wronged, even if he has done wrong?
A newborn baby?
not at all.
Describing the pregnancy as "depressing", Plasco said his wife was pregnant less than two months into her baby and was therefore in "a difficult situation".
"Would you support such a thing?
This is not a good thing", said the investment banker.
While the trial was ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly saw the couple on the news media, criticizing them for their conduct and system.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not want to be associated with the talking doll, a new letter reported
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it the first time before it is published.
It is good to know now what we know about Paddington's great victory".
Noting that her father, who worked as a photographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book through a little puppet, had done so knowing where the book was not received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication was "difficult and enjoyable" after his death last year.
From Paddington, who describes herself as "an important member of our family", she says that her father was proud of his great success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud", she said.
"But because Paddington was genuinely honest with him, he said that your son had achieved a great achievement: you would be proud of them even though they weren't.
I think he saw the same success Paddington was having, in this way.
Although he was his creator and mind, he always paid homage to Paddington himself".
her daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye on the phone
Her daughter was rushed to the Nice hospital in Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"I called him repeatedly to say that it was so bad, that I had not been able to get off", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Wake up, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors used to keep her motivation working began to slowly stop working and to stop her.
She died a few times before now and that's covering it all.
I had to sit back and wait, knowing that everything was going to be solved.
I could not cry or shout because I was surrounded by people.
I tried my best to calm down.
Lastly Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, still grieving the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers - regardless of the tragedy.
No one knows, she is.
I lay my head on the ground, and tears poured out all the time.
It was very difficult to explain, but it was on board that I first felt a deep compassion for Nad.
How he needed her love and understanding.
Far from the love of women.
Women fighters send cards to stop their killers on the bridge
Two women who had lost loved ones to suicide worked to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys also posted cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call to support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he first developed depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the same way I do every day", she says.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a sickly donor.
Everyone knows him by his smile.
They often say that his smile lights up every room.
Yet, he left the job before he died, while "in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler, who was 11 at the time, was the first to recover his brother's body after he committed suicide.
"I continue to worry that there is a possibility of retaliation", Ms. Davis said.
Ms. Davis invented the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if they are your friend.
Do not be silent - you should speak.
Ms Humphreys, who was a partner of Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old boyfriend, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling uncomfortable or stressed or anything", she says.
"Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his personality.
He was at the base of the rock on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he refused to close his eyes to them,
She said that his death was a big problem for them, but they had to work through it: "It leaves a gap in the family.
He confused us.
But we must continue to live and struggle.

Brett Kavanaugh's presence hangs in the air, because the FBI has begun an investigation
"I think, if we can find something like what he's looking for - just a short-term, limited research - how can we bring about a little cooperation", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "divided" by the overwhelming political views.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and supporters of the Republican Party want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance to do so was delayed.
The midterm elections are five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans don't try, then they will be deeply affected in their attempt to tie up the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was on the phone calling the Senators, begging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces a report?
Elections will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the nomination and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of resignations in North Korea fell under Kim
The number of North Korean resignations to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power in the past seven years, a South Korean policy adviser said.
Park Byeong-seug, who reports from the South Korean Ministry of Cooperation, said that there were 1,127 resignations last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said increased border security between North Korea and China and higher prices for insecticides were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on the situation.
Most North Koreans who resigned were granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people fled from China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ, which has a security fence between the two Koreas.
China considers resigned immigrants illegal immigrants rather than refugees and thus accepts them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still at war - have improved in a few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on a nuclear disarmament deal.
This came after the historic June founding meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to a deal that would lead to the country's nuclear disarmament.
After a June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, they agreed to sign an agreement for the use of the North-Eastern Republic of Congo.
"Without the US, we will not trust our security, and in such circumstances, there is no way to destroy our weapons ourselves", Mr Ri said in his address to the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "ridiculous", saying he was not worthy of a Supreme Court position
Home Secretary Nancy Pelosi, who called for the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said he "does not qualify for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman ever did something like that, they would say 'ridiculous,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh politely dismissed the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both children.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed his deep sympathy, sometimes nearly shouting and shaking as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also openly criticized the Democratic Party on the committee, calling the allegations against him "terrorist, organized and decriminalized", which the rebels had orchestrated, angered by the fact that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi admitted that Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he was discriminating against Democrats.
"I think it shows his lack of merit with these statements and the way he handled Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi avoided when asked if she would try to overthrow Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrat won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this - if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only the Supreme Court was not fit for him, but also the current court", Pelos said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possibility of Kavanaugh's ruling on the Fair Housing Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was supposed to be a conservative judge.
In a willingness to listen, Kavanaugh asked some questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not a time for fun, for someone who is unwilling to go to court and hopes we will say, 'No wonder,'" said Pelos.
And Their Wives Need to Use It.
She is a righteous woman, months and years of anger have passed, and she cannot speak without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's a number, you know?"
She continues, "I got help from a manager at a house, who said she cried when she was angry, but she kept using the technique which means when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I was angry".
Then she continued her journey.
And I thought that was a good thing".
I'm often guilty of misunderstanding.
One of the greatest memories of my first job, in a man-dominated office, where I once cried with endless anger, was that an old woman with a neck-like appearance - then a modest boss I always doubted - came down the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying", she told me.
They don't realize that you are angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to find you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught engaging in adultery on a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder was very disappointed, stating that there was no reason to prevent him from expanding his ideas and to seek the presidential nomination himself.
"It was a bad idea", she said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other contestants in the race, and they needed one more.
One called it "the white-headed eagle and the seven horns".'"
Because she was late for the campaign, she was behind on the money, so she vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
This was a battle that was devastating.
She found that some of her fans had given $1,000 to men and would have given her only $250.
"Do you think I'm getting better?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech that she would not run for office, she said with regret - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that came with the difficulty of earning money and electing voters instead of representatives, and anger at gender - that she was satisfied.
"You would think I was mentally ill", recalls Ms. Schroeder of the press pressure on her.
"You think Kleenex was a cowardly carrier.
I remember thinking, 'Will they go and put oil on my grave?'
Did you cry?
How the US-China trade war could be beneficial to Beijing
The goal of starting a trade war between the United States and China is strong, and the problem is not permanent, between the two countries and could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing China's major exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase this week was tariffs on roughly $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, so that one-tenth of all goods coming to the United States from China would be paid.
Beijing has repaid all in the same way, recently increasing tariffs from five percent to ten percent on US$60 billion of goods.
China has promised to use the US-led "shoot me-shoot you" system, and the country is not ready to split up anytime soon.
To make Washington withdraw would also mean to curb demand, but to pull the United States out publicly would be more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can print its cards correctly, the United States can support China in the long run by reducing economic dependency.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to a downturn in the economy of any country is more dangerous than previously believed by viewers", says Abigail Grace, a researcher with responsibility for Asia.
Syria is ready to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is secretly accepting refugees who have volunteered to return and are asking for help to rebuild the country that was devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the World Health Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and is reflected in the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government has continued to repair the devastated areas of the country to restore peace.
All the conditions now in place to return refugees to the country were left out due to terrorism and economic measures affecting their daily lives and their environment.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in their country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the devastated territory.
However, he insisted that he would not accept any support, or aid, from countries that had supported the violence.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup and defeated the American team in the 2018 final the match finished with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight to Europe and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown with Danish captain Thomas Bjorn who scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American superstar Phil Mickelson, who scored the game's all-time high, threw a goal into the water at par-3 hole 16, giving Francesco Molinari his game.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all goals, becoming the 1-out-4 player to go on to win 5-0-0 since the tournament's inception in 1979.
American forward Jordan Spieth came out on 5&4 among the lowest players in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's leading goalkeeper, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in the Ryder Cup final.
Former Ryder Cup winner Serbia Garcia became the most successful European Cup winner of all time with 25.5 points.
I have cried for a long time, but I can't help myself now.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas took me in and accepted me.
I was so happy, so happy, that I could get the trophy back.
It's about the team., And I'm glad I can help", Garcia said in a sentimental atmosphere after the European victory.
He handed the light to his compatriot, John Ram, who scored the opening goal of the US Tiger Woods 2 & 1 match in Sunday's singles match.
"The pride I felt, hitting Tiger Woods, grew up watching this guy", says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 for the Ryder Cup career.
An amazing figure from one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 second prizes behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled over the weekend to find better ways to do without Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a great golf game in both games.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the game's disappointment to his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were in a heat wave in Europe.
We have been wiped out.
I'm going to Thomas.
He was a captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 men and am proud to serve as captain.
You must keep your hat on.
