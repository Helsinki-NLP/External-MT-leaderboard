While an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, no drugs have so far been shown to be effective in treating an existing infection.
The antibody mixture ZMapp initially appeared promising in this area, but formal studies indicated that it was less effective than thought in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was a control, meaning that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already been widely accepted, it also provides details that fossils generally can't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other features of feathers - rays and beads - the researchers concluded that feathers were likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or for decoration. The researchers thought that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather suit and not a chicken's dander.
Scientists believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows a plumage of an adult individual and not a chicken's dander.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma current.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic twists.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and is made up of lots of tiny particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.
Residents near the plant were warned by local authorities to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning, and avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and there was reason for alarm because of its very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health care workers.
In a year, an infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire human population that has TB still seems low, 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

Millions of vials of encephalitis vaccines have also been promised by the government, helping health care to prepare for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the historically worst-affected areas this year were delayed due to lack of funds and low priority compared to other diseases.

"Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stable as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature throughout the day".
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the polling station and signs the ballot.
The procedure is very precisely codified in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can see that the ballot boxes are empty at the start of the vote and that no ballot papers are added other than those correctly spelled out and from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were seen in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful when publishing pictures of suspects and the like".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the pre-67 borders.
Other subjects covered included the supposed future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities agree to leave the valley for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial were to be closely monitored by park officials as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four snipers selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in by Mr Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In some 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Office announced that there were no reports of damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who was going to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that giving a hormone would speed up the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the moon, quite unique, like herself, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as I was... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The constitutional Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the vote, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m, 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his condition has been called into question.
He could not take the medication needed to combat his pain, as these are prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political rumour and stupidity".
There's speculation about whether he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be put in and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility of being forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process would have taken much longer because of mating between the endemic Darwin finch Geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin cable that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, which were called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Brinons are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a lavatory connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women shared a common space.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat the far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, fleas, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The Huns are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flock reacts much like wolves or dogs in flock, animals that are surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete, able to climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a string of snorting, shouting words.
The owl prefers small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that lizards follow and find prey by smell, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly, chasing their prey by moving in line with their surroundings and then jumping over their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (as if it were moving across a mountain range or a river, or if it were moving to a new island so that it could not easily move back), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously would have been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a cleft tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't stop it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seabird.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't that important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, and the shops were open countertops facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a tax card is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even though it says something on the back of the document, it's not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's likely that the note was just attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - that is, the French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and it also defines in some way the size of society.
The European Union is a global community of nations, and the European Union is a global community of nations.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress as the sole component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they depended on governmental authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all acts.
Nor did it have the right to disregard tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an 'island group'.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named it Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the original grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from the sensor sizes in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining some order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European nations despite their different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the most important Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question the proper application of this dogma.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain embarked on a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching the area.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, most citizens and nations tended toward pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period of split provinces between each dynasty, the most well-known of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were fierce wars between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same is true of the military, because instead of rank-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life, and he used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains are visible, and very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the world-famous Great Pyramid being the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-arrow mark looks like a V and the down-arrow mark looks like a staple, or a square that is missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the seed (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward sounds usually produce a softer sound, while downward sounds are stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the markings inscribed are for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a shouting mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot wide open.
At one point, a member of the mob presented the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and bond interest ran through the banks on Wall Street in the government's name.
Of course, the super profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The time period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term which encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to the narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic, which is linked to scientific laws and the way they are expressed in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that is hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, it may be said that the motor-driven car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increased number of car owners also increases the number of road accidents, leading to new health-care techniques to heal injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures related to geography developed that were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to have been an epicenter of luxury since about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices of greater value than the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most widespread in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily inspired by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western species could fall 25-30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the biggest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to attach clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterised by age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that govern a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children through failure, accident or willful neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Some wild children have been deprived of their liberty by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) that is nearly identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, placement goes a step further.
Placement is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Standards can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of stand, but so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stands are internalised in the software and are intended to question, ask for and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care and education, but they do so nonetheless.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is responsible for providing all the necessities that were not available in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and human-to-human communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added by mutation and removed from the pool of exact variations by selection".
Separation and recombination blend the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to comply has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and, eventually, death.
The most readily available plant sources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning the clock off while you're sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing one to get up and turn on the water.
The amount of inner calm a person has is the exact opposite of the amount of tension a person has in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All humans have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga, through which the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were almost overnight obsolete, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Nonaggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to ship troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Households were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, the more commonly known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, wagon roads were built in England.
Although the carriageways were made up of only parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day.
Swingers were invented early on to hold tracks in place, but it was eventually realized that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of metal were used.
The first known method of transport was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
There are two-legged specialisations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have grown because of overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he had it read to his troops in New York.
25 The Dunlap Sheets, which still exist, are the oldest surviving version of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language now.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely parasitize humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nestless, which means that they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are some 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in the best interests of them or their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method.
But it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue for a period of time with free-running cycles even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the bag with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bag with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape and the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, as well as studies of ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where in the morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonised economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of the community and uses the transportation system.
In developed lands, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, motorists typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the dayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
His theory was divided - some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because we can't feel the Earth rotate, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on earth, containing over eight times as much water as the second largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, reaching up to six miles (9.6 km) in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and engineering expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those employed in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is a basic mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the point that ends this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is less used as new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to get near the tip of a pencil.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down under little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more lunar gardens on the front, because the crust here is thinner, which would have made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is centered around finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
Theories investigate what is in certain people that causes them to perform certain actions and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the need pyramid and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when a manager starts to manage his former colleagues.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performing performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise are set for virtual teams as for conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity begin to show when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organisation.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation and knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organisations to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models with, which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although often associated with science fiction, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves being able to make machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been incorporated into numerous home computers and computer game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom, and quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions through virtual excursions, where students can view museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good way to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills.Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, audience presence generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered genuinely Canadian by outsiders.
Further north are large areas of sparsely populated land, some of which is almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is reasonable to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it should just not look too animal.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be chased, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagin, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide variety of snacks, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
Together with the city's relative inaccessibility, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites threatened by the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different types of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this gives access to either a selection of South African parks or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be the primary focus area.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that, reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour, is often compared to a glittering column diagram,
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon harborfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on developed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining vegetation of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/moss areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 chitals now live in the area.
Buses run from the inter-regional bus station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Dele taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important group of natives living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India", came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed at the equivalent of the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted within Stanley.
In the outlying islands credit cards are unlikely to be used, although British and American currencies may be; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so be sure to change your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures are usually above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards per meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from any other wildlife!
No matter how delicate they may appear, bison, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals are capable of attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep proper distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port formed the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful rally took place in the city, resulting in the murder of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour District) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are found at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the seafront.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It's safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and people are rarely injured on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea otters are found near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations give the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often offer special offers for hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transport arrangements or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, requests for changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival participants choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be where it's happening, you're gonna have to get in early to get a tent near the music.
Remember, even if the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, check your cabin, since sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms), which is nice to know as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do their best to keep guests from spending as much time and money as possible, and windows and clocks are often missing, making it difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special deals on food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and in the house.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served at the house's expense, but drunkenness weakens judgment, and all true gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who has to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On icy and snow-smooth roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windscreen.
On the other hand, snow and ice are common in many countries, and traffic is generally undisturbed year-round.
Safari is the highlight for many and perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land trips to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars, so standard equipment is sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cloudy, and you can see them better with a binocular.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walk safari", or "walk safari") consists of hiking trips that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having also hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and your accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that you can borrow even if you don't have one in your room.
If you cannot use a ironing board or if you do not like wearing ironing socks, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they do not know from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the backcountry.
Beware if you are not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow lanes and steep turns are plentiful.
The speed limits are markedly lower than on the preceding and following routes  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them exactly.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, as in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common: apples are baked in cakes year-round, and cherries and flowers appear during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you fancy some small but filling cakes, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, when used without further elaboration, the term typically refers to the food originally sourced from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the island group, consisting of a variety of simple spicy dishes, the most popular of which are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Footrests are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off his horse but has one foot caught in the rope, he may be pulled along if the horse runs away.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety belts that release the climbing straps from the saddle if they are pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain tops offer stunning views from the peaks to all visitors, and climbers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes amid its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve running down snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski-boarders" - planning their entire holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 B.C. show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skitting or skiing.
It is related to, but not usually involves, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the circuit as if it were a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than if you were walking, but it is very rare that you will be able to reach the same speed as on a cross-country ski without a heavy backpack and on cleared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be smaller in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be classified as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Livestock is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other occupations.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer in large numbers, but they lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, and used reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trades, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although the word "Gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel orders are issued in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be tailored to their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.

The views expressed are often corny, general and simplified in comparison with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena which can cause damage or serious social disruption or cost human lives.
Extreme weather can occur all over the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, hailstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely give the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they bring valid documents for the return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to cooperate in issuing passports with an unidentified gender (X) or documents updated to give a person the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies equally.
Security inspection visits have also become more urgent in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgery should not expect to pass through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the shore, often at a reef or similar, is called a countercurrent.
Because of the underwater topology, the return stream is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow of deep water can be formed.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it's no harder than usual to swim back.
Try aiming for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might wait to be rescued.
Home shock comes faster than culture shock (which is not as much a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had a good time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your customs from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a whole new land needs to adjust.
People do not necessarily expect patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors, and the story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is set against a backdrop that tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, with sixteen active by 2020.
The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.

The northern part of the Sentinel Range is home to Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m (14,070 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a sabbatical is travel and learning.
This is particularly popular among those who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your sabbatical year may actually improve your chances of gaining a place at a higher education institution in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programmes.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and islands along its coast.
In the oceans and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, a smaller boat or even a kayak gives you a different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens when it flies can help them overcome a fear of the unknown or of not having control.
Delivery companies are well paid for delivering quickly, and time is often critical when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger airlines have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they were shipping goods by air, on some routes it could have taken days to get through loading and unloading.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a big pile of money in front of the opportunity (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the standard price of economy class for business class and eleven times the price of first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain key groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting there quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

General announcements in the metro are given only in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, behaving as one who is "bien élevé" (high-skirted).
The cool exterior of Paris evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with forest - mostly beech and coniferous trees - and offers a mix of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities because of its many microclimates, different soil types and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, you will find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, moose, wild cat and bull.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear undergarments that cover their knees, while also covering their shoulders.
Most monasteries have veils for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with strong colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not be completely comfortable wearing these underwear.
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a large amount of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any kind of available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "you" for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It undoubtedly makes reading easier, though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a noun or an adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.

Former observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from flowering trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to "take just one sample".

Since the first humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
