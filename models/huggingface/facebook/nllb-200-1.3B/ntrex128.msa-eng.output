Welsh MPs worried about 'looking like dolls'
There was unease among some MPs over the proposal that their titles should be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament for Wales).
It arose from a plan to change the name of the conference to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum worried it could invite a riot.
A Labour MP said his party cared that it rhymed with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means crazy and pwp means dirty.
The AM from Plaid said his party was "not happy" overall and had suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "openly thinking" about the name change, but stated it was a brief verbal leap from MWP to Doll.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Council Commission, which is drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any nomination of a Council Member must be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of public consultation on a proposal that received broad support to call the council the Parliament of Wales.
As for the AM title, the Commission was favoured by the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
The AM seems to be suggesting an alternative, but is struggling to reach a consensus and could convince the honorary chief officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The law on reforms includes other changes to the way the council functions, including rules on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
The A.M. will get the final vote on what questions to ask when they discuss the bill.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was instituted in an attempt to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which had its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly rejected its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Square is silent because the churches are struggling in Harlem.
"The old man I met said, historically, there were bars and churches on every street corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, they're both gone".
He said losing a bar is understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now", he said.
"The bar is no longer the living room in the neighborhood where people go all the time".
For the church, he was worried that the money from the sale of assets wouldn't last as long as the leaders expected, "and that they would eventually return to where they started".
Churches, he said, could be replaced with apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who don't want to help maintain the shrines that remain in this neighborhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condos in this building are white", he said, "and therefore will have these churches closed down altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these condos will be members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by the black community under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the hiring or promotion of blacks in employment.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered a bell tower.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson of St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell tower as the "bell of the poor".
The experts who played the carillon in July called it something else: "Cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been playing out at St Martin's over the last few months has been a nuisance to architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, others by the Episcopal bishop.
The vestry - the governing body of the parish, which is made up of civic leaders - wrote to the bishop in July with concerns the bishop "will seek to approve the cost" for the vestry, even though the vestry itself is not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's department.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving for shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for shrimp in California on the opening day of the shrimp season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream to catch a shrimp, but he realized that the boy was screaming, "I have to bite!"
I need a bite!
His entire skeleton was broken and open, which Hammel said he noticed when he got the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The child was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it had been determined to be a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials are closing off beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles notes that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's took Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams from a beauty salon in a multi-purpose building run by expert assistants.
As part of a concerted effort to enter the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home appliance sales return, larger beauty spaces will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and brought to more buildings next year if it is successful.
Investment in beauty emerged as supermarkets sought ways to use shelf space once claimed for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as are available in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched a variety of boutique cosmetics to make the majority of its products vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by shoppers from the younger generation.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week while the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and shifting to buying a little bit of food every day at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to work harder to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the branch would look like a department store as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the big business Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several locations since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have boosted retail sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket has previously sought to reform the beauty and pharmaceutical sectors which ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a similar venture with Boot in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split the revenue from the pharmacy in its marketplace.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds chain of pharmacies, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the plan, adding various luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy within the four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty spaces to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in partners who are specially trained to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and our attractive environment and convenient location means we are now an exciting beauty destination that challenges the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones 's owl' after Holly Willoughby pulled off an £11 million bid
Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, 'swimmed' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly brand household goods and accessories.
The pair's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The This Morning host, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a rage by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her new extraordinary contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "appalled" when the successful TV lady admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote to household goods and accessories from the Truly brand.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain on his way to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "All this time, Truly has been Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that can see him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out all the people involved is truly shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff at Marlow's headquarters ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's presenter, who is among the most acceptable stars in Britain's banking industry, could hurt firms by millions due to massive investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and potentially delay its launch.
And it could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV lawyer on I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business dealings".
'A firm conversation and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism that would be received by the news media for making comments that some would consider "inappropriate to the president" and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so giving up?
Trump said in the voice of the news reader.
"I never give up".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards halting North Korea's nuclear program.
But the negotiations to end the nuclear program were put on hold.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States to the North's initial ceasefire move.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We have good relations with North Korea", he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
We have a great relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing the remains of former American soldiers back to the homeland.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate islands, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs told us that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition for increasing international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly do not ask for international help, so it is quite challenging", Ms. Sumbung said.
When Save the Children together in a team went to Palu, it was not certain whether foreign staff could work at the scene.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given Indonesia's frequent earthquakes, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastal shores.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though the warning has been in effect, seems to be contributing to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between the islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters have made logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims was on its way to Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made poor infrastructure improvements a priority in his election campaign, and he has allocated high allocations to roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit the Jokowi administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi faced pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority Muslim members have adopted a more conservative religious understanding.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge has tied the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 seconds from Chelsea's goal with his team leading 1-0.
He kicks the ball to the left before he spins it into the far end of the net.
The attempt soared high above the goal as it floated towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball fell on Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get in that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I try to extend the time as much as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a deal and didn't think long then make a shot at".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before stumbling across the midfield and running into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic is giving and sending can be fast in the middle.
He then released a beautiful kick, taking Hazard into the goal.
The danger of overtaking the defence and scoring a goal away with a left foot kick overtakes Liverpool's Alisson Becke.
Liverpool is facing Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and triggered a wave as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I would urge anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded footage from the dashboard cameras to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found inside her home.
By the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police say an investigation is underway, they're in the process of informing the victim's heirs.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He's going to be a pain when he finds out what's going on.
Residents were told the investigation would take hours before they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene crying.
He kept saying "it's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van outside.
Several officers stand inside the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 from September 30th.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament is the latest monument to be hit by 'historical rewriting'
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction the Taliban inflicted on so many English cultural artifacts and religions by their fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society dismissed Mr Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is unavoidable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be the target.
Iconoclasm from the English Civil War was either not directed or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwell is a 19th-century testament and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was the individual known as the figure who represented a divided section.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and remembered".
Pigs Beat Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed, blood-stained artery near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig door open next door.
He said in the pigsty was a big pig with a bloody mouth.
Forensic examination confirms that a 550-pound pig has beaten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"the family of Wu", said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the store at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Night News that the pigs had been locked up to prevent them from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig strapped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren't always aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're nipper, so curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect,' he said
The addition of Rosa brought heavy rainfall to the southwest.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves into the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. West Coast As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to push the tropics northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacts with the approaching troughs which create heavy rainfall in the southwest the next day.
Inland, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more from Arizona.
The flash floods may be in dire straits due to tropical rainfall dispersal.
It is highly recommended to venture into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to creep up rivers and thunderstorms that will bring the country high winds and dust blowing.
The approaching trough will bring heavy rain to the Southern California coast.
Rainfall amounts greater than half an inch are likely, which can cause small debris flows and slippery streets.
This is the first rainfall in the region during the dry season.
Some tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes even more intense late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
October can see some intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain slightly warmer.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There was a great example of a temperature difference across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to build and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start through October with 80s extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeastern part.
New York City could get to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting an alleged victim in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute touch: an agreement drafted by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was messing with him and trying to unbutton him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his explanation, said it's 100% impossible.
It's probably over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company calculates the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures are not immediately available for other networks showing PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, that's the size of an audience at a football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, which argued the hosts had backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after hearing.
Flake is the main character in this Friday's drama.
After moderate Republican office-holders issued a statement he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught as CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning shouted at him by protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes as he preached, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country??
She was told, "You have power when many women don't".
Flake said that his office has issued a statement and said, before the elevator closes, he will be speaking at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the hours live afterwards, when the Judiciary Committee voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI will look into charges against the nominee next week, the minority Democrats urge.
Flake believed part of the conversation was with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the Coons and several senators' discussions afterwards, Flake made a decision.
This Flake option does have some power, because it's clear Republicans wouldn't have voted to pass Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and jeopardising the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on what he called the Checkers for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was "completely absurd".
Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in jail on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to physically shooting Wayde to death.
The bond has been set at $350,000, the attorney general's report.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released an early report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents in assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "cooperation and efforts for justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "awful" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you've been worrying about all along", Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano reaches the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased at the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and dust over 24 hours.
This center monitors a variety of earthquakes and tremors.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of car windshields on the cover of ash in residential areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan sympathizers ahead of independence day vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined demonstrations to mark the first anniversary in Catalonia's polarized election of secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police launched them with eggs and released paint powder, creating dark clouds on the roads that are frequented by tourists.
Fights also occurred later with the police using their batons to fight.
Hours later pro-independence groups chanted "No forget, no forgiveness" against union protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 vote was declared illegal by Madrid but welcomed by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overall to remain independent, although the turnout was low with those opposing secession largely boycotting the vote.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the election from taking place at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out last Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went ahead but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the secessionist protests with his wife said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's prospects for independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote but now we're stuck", she said.
Although management is crucial if it is to come close to winning regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence party has struggled to maintain momentum this year with prominent leaders many of whom are either in exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government", he said.
Man arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
The A-arc may have also fired shots at the car at one point.
The Meneera attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston earned the win.
Livingston's rise stunned Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be a bit of a shock as Gary Holt's team moved into second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts boss, who they will chase by eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unbeaten run in this division to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling the loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the opposing team.
The Holt team should have been far ahead before they scored, with their involvement causing the Rangers all the trouble.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his passing effort, however Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after a swing to Craig Halkett's horn.
The hosts were eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they could cause trouble to the opposition with the set cuts.
And that's how the important goals are.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set up Menga, who took the touchdown and scored from the center of the field.
At that point, the Rangers had taken possession but had found a home defense that could not penetrate goalkeeper Liam Kelly largely without a problem,
The pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue for Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston game.
Crosses went straight into Livingston's box and continued to clean, while two penalty shootouts - after Halkett's challenge for Glenn Middleton's replacement, and one for handball - bounced off.
'Fenomen' from Livingston - the analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A remarkable performance and a result for Livingston.
For men, they're brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but a large credit has to go to Holt for his smooth running of the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was very brave, creating a great organized defense, while Mena kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
The Rangers lack inspiration, though.
Good as they sometimes are under Gerrard, they fall far short of that standard.
The ball was last quite lacking - only once they cut the home team- and it was a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to bar the 25,000 strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The war protests depicted the fate of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some Turks and dismissed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
Cyclist killed in collision involving car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Road, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police say officers are working to identify the man and notify his heirs.
Road closures and buses are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in disturbance
Six correctional officers were injured in a disturbance at the high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
"Tornado" Specialist officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight residents and has one wing.
The officer was treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Trained prison staff have been assigned to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members have been treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring the police and can spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year a riot police officer was called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance where staff were attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding.
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind-power tracks cross the Southwest Desert, risking flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the route up Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night in the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border".
The National Hurricane Center's latest model predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts as high as 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated amounts up to perhaps 4 inches.
For those at risk of flash floods, the Rosa rain may be a blessing since the region is plagued by drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, some say rainfall will benefit since the Southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences the worst drought, the second highest category", weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa is heading for the mainland of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, a strong hurricane Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore is descending.
So, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across Mexico could be heavy, causing a risk of major flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, up to possibly 10 inches", weather.com reports.
Rosa will trail north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then trailing through Arizona and south into Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main expected hazard from Rosa or debris is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and U.S. Southwest deserts", said the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton raid: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with injuries in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Officers are urging those who may have cell phone recordings of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "suffering, meaningless, angry" Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the brutal and extreme tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered a very bad, angry" Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him at the time of the teenage riots.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in public service", he told the crowd supporting West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of the Republican nomination in the general election.
"In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but I really did run", he said.
"That's why I'm in this place fighting for the best candidate".
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and prevent".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, the GOP's senior leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami, with toll figures rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by a giant wave that crashed ashore, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for celebration on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave crashed ashore at dusk, sweeping away many deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and not running and they ended up being victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it dragged cars, shells, houses, it hit everything on land", said Nugroho adding that the tsunami had crossed the open ocean at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and were safe, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Paluu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, a bridge twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The final shaking continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Some aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Research and Technology Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake last Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said that 540 more people were injured and 29 more were still missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and destruction may be more devastating along the coastline 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter.
"Communications have been completely cut off without any information from Donggala", said Nugroho.
"Approximately 300,000 residents live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy but it could be worse", the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu even though officials said the tsunami occurred within the period the warning was issued.
In an amateur video that went viral on social media, the voice of a man on top of a building was heard shouting at the crowd on the street about the presence of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave swept ashore and swept away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power leak that cut off communications around Palu and this made it difficult for the authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities but many of the displaced residents still need food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the relocation center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 800 people.
It's very rough.
While World Vision staff from Donggala had safely arrived in Palu city, they passed through the disaster scene.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
He's in a terrible state.
Although the relief team began disaster relief in a bleak atmosphere, some say foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply of supplies and dispatch of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", then we can get help from abroad but for now there is no status.
As the second night approaches in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami last Friday, friends and families of the missing victims hope their loved ones will miraculously appear and cry out instead of grieving.
On Saturday, a boy was found in the bunker.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued the female victim who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body lying next to it.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national para-snowboard team, has trained the two para-snowboys missing from the earthquake for the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi said.
"As a senior in surfing, I have my own emotional burden", she said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how he was so eager to send a WhatsApp message to surfers in Palu who were attending the beach festival hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the surfing community.
The message sent had only one grey-letter mark versus two blue-letter marks.
"I don't think the message got through", he said.
Thieves robbed $26,750 during a cash-filling ATM at Newport on the Levee.
Thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink's employees who were cashing in at the Newport on the Levee ATM last Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink employee emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was willing to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's employee was busy doing his job, a man ran up behind him and stole a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the robbery involved should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: This man is officially known as Kanye West.
Kanye West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and he used that nickname as the title of his ninth album released in June.
The switch came during her appearance on Saturday Night Live where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance on the show over emotional issues, the show's creators said.
Earlier, Kanye West said that the name has religious significance and is also an abbreviation for his current professional name.
"I believe that yes is a common word found in the Bible and it means you", Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you too I'm us too We're us
It went from Kanye being just one, to Ye - an image reflecting our good, bad and mistakes and all.
The album is more of a reflection of our true self.
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former partner, Jay-Z, can also receive it without or with capital letters and punctuation.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to refrain from military action against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the student tragedy.
AMLO pledged in Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to never use the military to contain Mexicans.
The military fired on civilians who were demonstrating peacefully in the plaza on October 2, 1968, which had caused 300 civilian deaths as leftist student movements began to take root across Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its AI funding.
"The United States should double its funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China becomes more active in the field", said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was expressed after the US government made an announcement about artificial intelligence although the US itself as a whole lacks an official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year with a goal of becoming the number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the allocation for AI research is a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to have the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling funding could increase the chances of the next big artificial intelligence (AI) achievement in the United States", Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures who has invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and wanted to know when the next competition would be held so that he could identify new talent.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government funding", Lee said.
"It's not China that's hiring the academic leaders but the corporate ones", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting great talent from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think a green card should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center which aims to bring together partners from industry and academia.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
And the NSF invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US bill that attempts to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote to change the name of the country
Macedonians held a referendum on Sunday to decide on a name change to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would settle a decade-long dispute with Greece over which Greece has blocked Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own region named Macedonia, insists that the name Macedonia represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement on the proposed name change in June but the nationalist opposition said the change belittled the ethnic Macedonian identity of the majority of the population being Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the ballot and the ruling raised doubts whether the ballot would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the ballot to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said the adoption of the new name was a price worth paying for EU and NATO membership for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live independently under the European Union because it means our lives are safer", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is illegal on the legal side, lawmakers said they would abide by the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of any irregularities occurring as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast ballots in Macedonia for the country's name change that will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and laying out chairs in front of a tent set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join with pride and not in this way", Kavadarkov said.
We are citizens of a poor country but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will accept because more than 80 percent of our population voted for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting the vote.
He said the decision was a confirmation of our future.
A poll was published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies that said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the ballot - below the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a ballot to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the vote would be seen as the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City navigates through the entire Brighton lineup to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent in as Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look extremely happy on his net in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward receives a delivery in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He raced through three Brighton defenses, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He's kicking a defensive back before catching a few more at the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he pushed the transmission to the left, looking for Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to re-send the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his leg problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that time".
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the Brighton area in that match.
He made a beautiful pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling into the far position.

Scherzer wants to play the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's little reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the stronghold on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications of a run out for the Rockies, who hold a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies grabbed at least a special spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock in their first division championship.
"Even if we just play, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams will play probably at the highest level that I will face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a rookie for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to make a counter-off in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, will be having a warm-up session on Thursday and will be doing a rebound on his usual Sunday break.
The right-handed rebounder from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president did not directly refer to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court's selection of Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican numbers coming in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
I don't fight but I fight hard and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidate", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this nasty group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, even if you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to violate to gain power and control.
The Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "reject and hinder".
"And you saw that four days ago", he said, calling the Democrats angry, evil and untrue".
He referred to Senate Judiciary Committee rank Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember what he said?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one -- that's the worst body language -- worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a large church.
It's intolerant of anyone who expresses their views.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I'm the latest in the AP Labor lineup to be told we're not welcome -- all because we're voicing our views.
My colleague Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment for her anti-Semitic support.
In my case, the criticism movement has criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, which is ironically almost the same issue that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
A meeting notice for the Nottingham East Labour party on Friday said that "we want an inclusive and productive meeting".
For almost eight years of my time as a local Labor AP, the GC meeting on Friday night covered just that.
Sadly, today, it is not the tone for many meetings and political promises "better, softer" have long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are unacceptable in the Labour party and every opinion will be judged whether it is acceptable by the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a former colleague, I think sharing the same political views started expecting me to make a U-turn and take a position that I would not agree with - whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak out - and it doesn't matter what I say - it's followed by criticism for abuse on social media, being told not to vote, criticizing the political centre, being told to quit the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues because my comments are more political.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and perseverance of my colleagues who are racked with sexist and racist swearing every day but never give up.
One of the political disappointments of this era is how the level of abuse has become habitual.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for Labour to foster cultural tolerance.
The fact is we are no longer the broad church and with every "non-belief" motion or change in the electoral rules, the party gets smaller and smaller.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last couple of years, telling me to keep quiet, not to get too prominent and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I wanted to do in politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, aroused by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my entire classroom ruined, I have tried to lead better public services for those most in need - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can possibly be mistaken about my position and the conflict with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand the sense of wasting time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no indiscriminate threats or political expediency will prevent me from acting in what I believe is in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is the AP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: The incomparable Ayr climbs to the top
Two slow attempts may have made the final decision a draw, but there is no doubt Ayr deserves to have success in this exciting and entertaining Tennent Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, the only one never to lose to 10 men.
Finally, their defense was superior, as much as they took chances, which made the home team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've tested our game so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Congratulations to Ayr, they took a better chance than we did".
Grant Anderson made the attempt in the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, was issued for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make a goal and Jason Baggot to capture the unconverted attempt.
Climo led Ayr on penalties, before, at half-time, he scored a point then solo conversion attempt to make it 17-5 to Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out, and from the start, Ayr went forward again through the Stafford McDowall trial, a conversion by Climo.
Ayr's vice-captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose returned the extra player with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of an intense time of pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for catching Climo without the ball, from the outside penalty line, MacPherson was reckoned behind by a forward hit by Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost like a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is seen to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is seen to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, where he wrote and starred alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to official records, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although sources from the Scottish Sun gave the impression that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving restaurant business.
'The ocean is ours': Landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen passage to the Pacific
The Marine Guard at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flying the blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were engraved with the motto: 'The oceans are our real property.
To get back is a responsibility".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, memories of losing the coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict are still vivid - like a longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
The expectations may be the highest of the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of solidarity and calm, and of course hopes for a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will side with Bolivia's claim that - after centuries of deliberation - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native Bolivian president - who faces a controversial run for re-election next year - also has a lot of leverage in Monday's outcome.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and if it does little will change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to award territory to Chile, and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
As for the ICJ's decision coming out only six months after the final arguments were heard, the case is "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, an expert in Chilean international law.
And not to delay Bolivia's policy any longer, these four years may be a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the Bolivian administration now", said Zárate.
Morales's hostile rhetoric has diminished Chile's little compassion, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile at one point would continue to talk, but it would be too difficult to have a conversation afterwards.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decisions are usually made quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of strife for the common good", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America - used maritime issues as political aids.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to have direct access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past".
North Korea says a nuclear ceasefire will not happen unless it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not have signed their nuclear ceasefire earlier if it did not trust Washington.
Ri is speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be looking to restart nuclear diplomacy that was stalled more than three months after Singapore's with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri said it was "just a dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington was cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a major ceasefire move.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is really serious about launching weapons that it sees as the only way to guarantee its national security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for the preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces its latest design of large headgear on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your hat collection or block out sunlight altogether, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a variety of large-sized bizarre headpieces for their SS19 collection on the show stage that embodied the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have been sending their own humorous designs onto the stage.
A prominent design by Valentino is a water-yellow super-hat decorated with thick artificial fur that broadens over the model's head.
Other large-size accessories include jewel-decorated turnips, smart hats and even pineapples - but they're not designed to make your head hot.
Thom Browne also revealed a strange choice of masks - and the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had been sewn on his lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than elegant.
One design resembles scuba diving gear equipped with snorkels and goggles, while another looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you stick with the big fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that a very large bonnet may be heading for the main road near you.
The big-size hat is warmer than 'La Bomba', a two-foot-wide straw hat that has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label king behind the highly impractical hat has been featured on social media sending another big design onto the stage - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wrapped around the bathing suit she's wearing.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia edges and supplemented with white leather handles, featured prominently in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I'm looking forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags arriving on the main street for next summer - because the designers have made such a huge impact and it's hard to let the demand for large-size accessories go.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship.
Scottish private schools maintain a record of performance for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector can and implemented the early school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and subjects of choice are sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his native language it will reach his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's test results, we can see which language is the top subject in the league table with the highest graduation rates in private schools.
68 percent of students who study a foreign language get a higher A grade.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students getting higher A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also got A's.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject of choice, being held in the same way as STEM subjects in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
That's why, over and over again, language skills are a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more prospective job opportunities requiring language, these skills are especially important in this globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having these skills for life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent cannot speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French being the only language of conversation used by the two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for kids today.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus more on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages seen as particularly important for the UK as it looks ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there are often many languages to choose from in private schools, with teachers who are experts in that area.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
There is no denying that in this day and age, in the global business environment, that language continues to be extremely important to the future of a country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as a skill for international communication.
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's all right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be over one and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers scout Mike Trudell has suggested that James may be playing in a limited amount of minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a pre-season game to be ready at this stage of my career", he said.
The time of the Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun his campaign for a rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote held for his pick to fill a vacancy on the federal bench, Trump is aiming to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in Nov.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm ET on this Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's trial of federal court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is strained over sexual misconduct charges with Senate confirmation votes expected to be suspended for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of this rushed meeting is to help the Republicans gain momentum in the run-up to the November election.
So, the Trump campaign says the five rallies next week are a "strengthening of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is critical to his agenda so the president will go to as many states as possible in our busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to support him", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to fight in the hopes of still being able to make it to the singles match on Sunday
After three draws, the corner-country game on Saturday night is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time.
The swing momentum is a concept of sport that is an invention but it is really believed by the players, and even more so in competitions like this.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They have a six-point lead and now it's four points, so we're bringing a little momentum, I guess", said Jordan Spieth as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, four points ahead with 12 more to go.
The Americans, as Spieth said, felt they had a bit of an edge and a sense of drive, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each having three out of four points.
Spieth exhibited a venomous game from scratch on the green and set an example for other players.
The cheering cheers became louder as he continued to walk, making the crucial slip to match the four points when he and Thomas were behind by two points.
His slip shot that gave them the win on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheers, which tells you that he believes the Americans are still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all there is to all these players now.
18 holes to show power.
The only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undisputed Ryder Cup legends.
This couple of different characters from Europe are attractive but they're favored four points out of four and they don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to do bogies on Saturday evenings, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday evenings and the final nine holes on Friday mornings.
The duration and the way their energy was delivered and shown by the supporters was proof they were the players to beat on Sunday, and no player was more popular to block the possibility of a European win during the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
They better be in different holes.
However, the talk of a European team winning is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it easy for Sergio Garcia, the four-man hero this morning, when he was matched against Alex Noren.
A bogi and a double on the first nine holes put the Spaniards and the Swedes in the lead.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and is far ahead on the final day but this four-session also shows Team USA possessing a courage that was previously questioned by many, including local fans.
The Europeans lead 10-6 heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe brought a comfortable lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after rebounding from a four-ball and four-player match by 10-6 over the United States.
Two great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead by two wins over Tiger Woods who are struggling to bring their Le Golf National win to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn struggled to retain the trophy seized at Hazeltine two years ago, overpowering the flawed American team in the morning four-ball session, with a 3-1 draw.
The U.S. team put more competition in the four-player game, winning two games, but failing to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 in Sunday's singles match to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive points during his and Molinari's time, dubbed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend was the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in a 5&4.
Woods, who went through two tough matches on Saturday, exhibited brilliance but has now lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-player games and in seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during the morning four-ball session, returned to match Henrik Stenson in a four-man match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - ranked number one and three in the world.
Europe is not so lucky on a quiet, relaxing day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the gauges for America with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 defeating Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 game in a four-player game that was lost on the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team trailed by four points to advance to the singles, even as defending champions Furyk's team needed only a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of second place, the counterattack on Sunday seemed beyond their reach.
North Korea says it's "unlikely" they would voluntarily disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions had caused their deep distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that his country would voluntarily release nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "important austerity measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing nuclear test sites and pledging not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, it is impossible that we will disarm arbitrarily first".
While Ri berated North Korea over Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, the fact seems significant because it does not reject voluntary denuclearisation as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for a "nuclear cessation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump gave assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea sought to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow the recommendation to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on 'ceasefire first' and increases the pressure level in the sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposes 'declaration of end of war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that restrictions can weaken us is the empty dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions are only worsening our distrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader brokered during a United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister mentioned only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party in the ceasefire issue were South Korea and not the US, the nuclear ceasefire from the Korean peninsula would not have found a stalemate".
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump named Kim as the "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still needed to be done and sanctions needed to remain in place until North Korea ended its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we experience a complete, final and verified nuclear ceasefire".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would then visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go smoothly.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea in the hours afterwards to have condemned him for making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to reveal missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "similar measures" that Kim sought were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and were heading towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been giving all its students more sleep in an effort to combat the growing culture of caffeine-based 'all-nights' learning.
One faculty member found that students at the world's top universities often fail to understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is providing a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of good sleep habits to help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students were sleep deprived for the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of the dorm room, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons, then encouraging participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", adds Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'staying up all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough quality sleep should be the students' 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain into a starvation mode, making it hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking his class last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should consider using alarm clocks before and after bed, and be aware of the dangerous effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, the winning goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another defeat on the field as Dolly Menga's net tied weak Steven Gerrard's team with a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were still looking for their first home win since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager to cause his side to fall eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership rivals, Hearts.
It exploded in the seventh minute before halftime and the Rangers seemed to have no idea how to even the score.
With Rangers now down to sixth, Livingston climbed to third and were just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers may face another problem after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after throwing an object from his team's range.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in his side's run to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after beating Ayr.
Holt retains the same Livi 11 team that stole a point from Hearts last week and he's certainly happy with the way his team has been playing that has worried their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the game but Livingston did more tries on goal.
They were supposed to score just two minutes into the first touch when Menga gave way to Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed.
A free kick from behind Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass the ball behind goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it was all but a hopeful turnaround in the last 30 minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been awarded a penalty in the 45th minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to give up just two runs in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily defended Lassana Coulibaly's horn and the weak fellow Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the rhythm of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to cope with Jacobs' planned moves.
Scott Arfield was just stiff when Declan Gallagher slipped the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the trade during the break by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost gave an immediate impact when the winger handed the ball to Morelos but Kelly who impressed came out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing team to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending long passes after long passes.
Holt's team should have widened the gap in the final rounds but McGregor defended well enough to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's horn slipped from the corner of the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton pleaded for another penalty kick during his clash with Jacobs but again Thomson ignored him.
Calendar: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
As the foundation of science ever since, the Geiger counter has been the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unnamed scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger detector, used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can actually hear the atomic effects of radioactivity in the mineral".
Evans: Yeah, it sounds like it now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creations that bear his name endure.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' malignant cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involved is to extract immune cells from patients, transform them in the lab.
It can "see" the proteins that are common to many cancer cells and then re-inject them.
The experimental vaccine has shown encouraging results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, recovered from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results suggest that we have a very good vaccine".
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating leukemia.
Kanye West attends a pro-Trump rally, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It's not well received
Kanye West was mocked in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song that night titled Ghost Town where she wore a "Make America Great" hat, she went against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I've asked white people a lot of times and they say, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
Look, if I'm worried about racism, I've moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star contests Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't aired, the Kanye West video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
Not sure if Rock was trying to make fun of West with that post.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has been having difficulty behind the scenes about his hat.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They're bullying me!
Then they said, "I'm in a non-important place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added, "Do you want to see the insignificant position?" saying that he would wear my Superman coat, because that means you can't direct me.
Try the love"
His comments prompted at least two mockery by the audience and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one attendee telling the publication: "The whole studio went silent".
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with his I Love it performance, dressed as Bottle Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who sent a message: "To one of the bravest of men: THANK YOU FOR BEING A CRITIC".
But according to the talk show host, Karen Hunter, West is "just being herself and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe accepts and shares an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free now.
So did we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as "the man formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the song refers to the music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later also as the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in a stabbing incident at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, is a toxic maniac.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the sword hero Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has dismissed the stereotype of the macho hero, saying his on-screen roles meant young people often felt like they had to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes 'something is wrong' and questioned how to deal with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt 'very strong' about dealing with the issue.
'I think it's a little bit strong personally, at the moment - where is our malevolence wrong?' he said.
'What did we teach boys as they grew up, in terms of the problems we see today?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: 'What is natural and what is taught?
What is it that's taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel they have to be this man?
I think that's one of the big questions of the moment -- how do we change that?
Because there's something obviously wrong with young men today.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be acting in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series ended next summer, saying he was "done with the battlefield and the horses".
In November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a pirate.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that has ever happened on Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show, so in that way, it gave me a future family and my life started from here,' he said.
Rose portrayed Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow played by Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, marking a change from the previous one.
Typically, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of those infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be on the rise.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Most disease spread is due to inadequate sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP senator data, citing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations by one of her staffers that she had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insists the claims were spread by members of the "ultra-right" and the website.
"Fraud, fraud and more bad fraud", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly circulated included the home address and phone number for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, broadcast by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses identifying the source of the shipment linked to Waters' office and disseminating information to Waters staff members, Hill said.
"These baseless allegations are false and a lie", Waters said again.
"My staff - whose identity, privacy, and security have been compromised by these false allegations - are completely unconnected to this leak.
These baseless allegations are completely false and fraudulent".
Waters's comments quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he has no Congressman qualities.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't get mad.
They can't resist.
They can't question the prosecution's motives.
They must feel calm".
Fleischer said while comparing Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true", he tweeted.
In fact, Waters said his office had notified "relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed", he said, "and they will be held accountable for all their actions that could be destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - the deception of the weak-willed Rowan Atkinson
It is common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English scam-action-comedy franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a satirical joke about how badly we're becoming a new export opportunity for the country?
However, the eye-popping and bored Johnny English has a chance to mess things up for a second time - the name signalling above all that he is a widespread comic creation designed for the territory of non-English speaking movie audiences.
He's certainly a stupid secret agent who's been acting weird to soften the glamour of having Clouseau's personality, a little Mr. Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
He was also inspired by the mysterious international traveler and spy agent Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in a now-forgotten television commercial for Barclaycard, leaving a mess afterwards.
There's a great moment or two in J.E.'s latest film.
I love Johnny English approaching the helicopter in his medieval suit and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy was on the air, but his comedy was very weak and bizarre, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
The joke felt as if it was being promoted to children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's unintentional mistake was not being innovative and focusing on the Atkinson movies in the Bean persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret web network, exposing the identities of all British agents on the ground and disappointing the agents in charge - a very minor character for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for the arrogant and struggling prime minister with political collapse and unpopularity: Emma Thompson gave her best with this Teresa May sidekick but there was nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence adviser told him every active spy had been compromised, and he needed to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is crippled and now works as a schoolteacher in some fancy places, but gives lessons that are not suited to being a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers spy science at an academy like the School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a flamboyant character played by the rather nefarious Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the great Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Undercover Secret Service, are back in action with the beautiful seductress character Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being influenced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventure with small tasks: disguising themselves as waiters, setting fire to and burning a French restaurant; laboriously smuggling himself into the luxury cruise ship Volta; and English sparking a chaos as he tries to use Virtual Reality headphones to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's home.
All the funny scenes were well done for the final round, but because it looked friendly and low-key there was a little bit of a children's TV show feel about it.
It's a rather simple film.
And like all the other Johnny English films, I kept thinking: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that was really suited to her talent?
The Na'vi Labour Party planned for the British people to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but being paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
It would see staff enjoying three-day weekends - but still bringing home the same paycheck.
The source said the idea was "in line" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: 'The policy study is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but working four days a week is an aspiration that is consistent with the party's approach to balancing the economy and favouring workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration was not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to advance his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power away from the "faceless director" and "scratchers" at the utility firm.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in the water company may not be able to recover their entire stake because the Labour government could make a 'cut' on the grounds that they are deemed to be wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and created an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 per cent of private sector firm equity to employees, who would receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to give their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I wanted to attend the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the accusation came out, and I said, 'Did you do it?'
He is firm, determined, clear".
Anyway, Graham's vote is already cast.
"I've made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a heavy toll", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett is adamantly denying it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he named couldn't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
Say you don't see any change".
Is the World People's Day and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Folk Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive lineup of superstars and an equally formidable mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather at the Great Central Park Grounds to not only watch acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively opposing it.
To receive free tickets to the show (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), the concert goers must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how far are the people of the world with 12 years to go to achieve their goals?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to get people to demand action, or just another case of clicktivism - making someone feel they've done something by just signing an online petition or by sending a message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who urge movements with different goals.
They say these actions have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will bring about change for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least $10 billion of that amount had been claimed or collected.
The group also estimates that the identified funds have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some notable committees include the Food Power, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unbalanced nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 petitions from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, the federal government and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make this unbalanced social inequality of nutrition a thing of the past", said Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced to fund a project, Nutrition Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children in need.
Answering one of the FAQs on his website that asks "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: This is a difficult and time-consuming journey - sometimes we will be disappointed and despairing.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because when we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among several artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy as a barrier to prevent Russia from exporting oil.
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil in markets, including in the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russian involvement in Syria - as is known, involving themselves at the invitation of the Syrian government - was supposedly to find new oil markets.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is to control the oil supply as they have done in Eastern Europe and in Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the officer, there's a way to solve this problem.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to blockade to ensure their oil cannot be marketed", he said.
Zinke said this while speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that bills itself as the "voice of the oil consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, and stressed that they were the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is more or less the same, affecting and replacing oil", he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its economy so dependent on oil.
The statement came as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe that is much cheaper for consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
As a result, Trump officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "heavy-handed" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin a target for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will increase the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters and is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin's opposition to Washington's so strongly blocking this project is for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am convinced that we agree that energy supply should not be used as a weapon of repression and that consumers should be free to choose", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US action has provoked discontent from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and also on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our country's energy supply". Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think hard" before becoming a presidential candidate following the midterm elections.
When the question mark was opened with residents of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider running.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and fix our broken government and this includes putting a woman at the top", she said according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will think hard about running for president.
Warren expressed his concern about President Donald Trump during an open question, saying that Trump is leading our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was very vocal in his criticism of Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh for the federal bench.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before the vote is taken".
However, a poll on Thursday showed a majority of residents in the area represented by Warren felt Warren was not fit to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies.
Thirty-two percent support him fighting.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting his potential to run and 48 percent disagreeing.
Other high-profile Democrats who are also being discussed as potential contenders in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin focused on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) track Palin at the Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, after coming home, I can feel the feelings of other families who are going through this PTSD and those who are coming home with injuries", she said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the incident of her son's arrest was "something significant" and she said of her son and other war veterans as, "They came back different, rather harsh and wondered if they would be commended for their sacrifices to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, disturbing a domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington backing the strike against the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support opposing a U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence attacks.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friend's petition in court Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and his son's violent gang had harassed him but US officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He's in a Texas prison.
Prosecutors from the states that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries plagued by gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum application policy reverses a decision made in 2014 whereby the Board of Immigrant Appeals had allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District of Columbia's attorney general, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "does not degrade state, federal and international laws that have been in place for decades".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances leading to the application, and to prevent it would violate that principle", according to the friend's statement to the court.
Prosecutors also dispute that the policy of blocking immigrants from entering the U.S. would hurt the U.S. economy by saying that it is likely that these immigrants would become entrepreneurs and "be the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered an immigration judge to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence crimes and gang violence in June.
Asylum will be granted to those who leave their homelands for fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or adherence to a different political stance, Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to solve all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Rescue efforts are intensifying in Palu while the death toll is doubling
For those who survive, the situation is more critical.
"I feel very depressed", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was nursing her baby boy with a fever in the run-down Palu city evacuation centre.
Every minute, ambulances are bringing bodies.
The water supply is very limited.
Residents were seen slowly returning to their homes, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save what they could.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which was too devastating.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside as aftershocks still occur.
Tears flowed as he scanned back as the quake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
There's no way to save ourselves.
I was stuck in a collapsed wall, I guess", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife's voice crying for help, then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and son.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accused China of backing out with propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper detailing the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid ad in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's top-selling newspaper - for the China Daily after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election explains what US officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure the Chinese state.
As it is common practice for foreign governments to air advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial move in this trade war is to target exporters in states like Iowa that support the Republican Party represented by Trump, say Chinese and US experts
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said the Beijing move has hurt many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a newsroom in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now more bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent newspapers.
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government embraces the freedoms practiced by the Americans, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press", Branstad wrote.
"By contrast, in the Beijing press, there are very few voices of opposition and you cannot see the real views of the public on the direction of China's economic state that is worried because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also added that one of the major newspapers in China refused an offer to publish his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans are turning a blind eye to women voters ahead of midterm elections because of Kavanaugh's story, analysts warn
While many prominent Republicans support and favor federal court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faces sexual harassment charges, analysts warn they will prompt a response, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
High emotions overwhelmed the story and most Republicans stated in their records that they would proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be changed, said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell Center for Studies in an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is not sure that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s move to force the FBI to open an investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a rally in the Senate courtyard as the Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say this is too high; it's true.
This is probably higher especially for female voters who will be voting from the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president and rarely vote.
Before Ford's public testimony detailing the sexual assault allegations against him by the federal court nominee, analysts speculated that there would be a massacre if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has been a very complicated thing for the GOP", said Michael Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds as a federal judge, it's also about how the Republicans handle this issue and how they treat him", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told a news release.
However, the American public seems to be split and doesn't know who to believe in the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies with more than half in Ford's favor.
A recent YouGov poll showed 41 percent said they would or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or might believe Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other allegation, reports Deborah Ramirez of The Guardian.
Last week Ford made a sworn confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh alleged he was drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez also said the federal court nominee also showed his penis in front of Ford at a party while he was a student at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creators of the World Wide Web plan to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is an open source company based on Berners-Lee's Solid software.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real goal is to take over the world.
"We need to do this now", he said of this startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It may contain a list of contacts, a daily to-do list, a calendar, a playlist and other personal professional supplies.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and all at once.
What's unique about storing data in this private store is that it's up to the user for who can access the type of information they need.
This company is running it through data.
The impetus for Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring specific resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own standalone apps without being centered in any location using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee also said he and his team are not in any discussions with Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change where all their business models will change immediately.
We're not asking for their permission.
In an article in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, its mission is to provide a business powerhouse and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of new websites built using Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been arguing loudly about the need for the web to be free.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the Web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The priests of the First World War Victoria Cross are celebrated
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combat soldier has been commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Father Benard Vann who received this award on 29 September 1918 in the raids at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by snipers four days later and without realizing he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was erected and unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a magnificent symbol" because the stone would be unveiled 100 years after his grandfather's daring act.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the de Saint-Quentin Canal which was filled with thick fog and passed through a fierce machine-gun attack.
Then he went to the border and with extraordinary courage and command before he went to the border with a single shotgun and shot three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's actions are something I'll never be able to repeat and so touching.
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Competition.
Micheal Vann said "I feel very honoured to be part of this movement and also adds true courage to the support that has been given by so many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they were given Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 but are disappointed by the main show.
A list of 13 matches from San Jose, including the six major matches that will be broadcast live each night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, UK viewers were stunned when the broadcast switched to the Peppa Pig show.
Some of them are angry because they stay up all night to watch this game.
One fan said the switch to the children's cartoon channel was a joke that didn't go through his head.
"The government regulations indicate that the broadcast at 6 a.m. is not suitable for the game so they had to broadcast for children", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
Khinzir's father, yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they were working on rescheduling the broadcast so that UK viewers could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about rebroadcasting, I think we can do something", Coker said.
But at six o'clock on Sunday morning we couldn't do anything until Sunday, our time, which was Monday, their time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, when that broadcast was switched, there was a lot of texting and it wasn't all that good to hear.
We're working on this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more of a government issue.
I promise this will not happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that's impossible for the fans.
This is a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley is a low-life about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling humiliated by his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
He was 24 years old and didn't realize it until he was in high school and realized that not everyone was like me.
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said after his father's title, he wasn't too concerned with winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this long-running show, Kris Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
His sudden appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" his peers growing up because "he wasn't socially accepted as either a man or a woman".
He said: To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others is what has driven me and given me the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was something he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to get more countries to stop criminalizing homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live in the open without any problems and wanted to give hope to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the incident of falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - was "unexpected".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years her senior, last year, but she said their age gap was never an issue.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- she competed in her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later -- she says it's very difficult to find someone in her age group who goes through the same challenges.
The couple became the parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley says "all the perspectives of his life have now changed".
"If you asked me last year, it was just about, 'I need to win the gold medal,'" he said.
There's actually more to it than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
Her son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if their tickets to London 2012 had been bought - because he wanted to sit in the front seat once.
"I don't have the heart to say that I'm not going to be there to sit in the front row".
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and was legally dead that I realized that he wasn't going to live forever", she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic games and won a bronze medal.
"I realized this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country in the Olympics, there is no other experience that can match this", he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which she sang with during the preparations for the Olympics and still makes her rummy.

Mickelson is not so prepared for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he must be prepared to make up for the game's performance so he doesn't end up in a tailspin.
Mickelson, who will play in this biennial event for a record 12 times, has been recommended by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes games on Saturday.
Instead of being the usual focus for the United States, these five major champions spent time cheering and practicing in the hope of improving the quality of the game.
A man who could not hit the ball straight even at the peak of his game, the 48-year-old was not a good choice for the Le Golf National course, where the long distance was too difficult for a shot that didn't hit the target.
And if this golf course alone is any indication, Mickelson in Game 9 on Sunday will face British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start with 12 singles games, start with a hard-on, then Mickelson's play is definitely crucial.
Furyk is so confident in his players, that's all he can say.
"He understood his role today, and he clapped his shoulder and put his hand on my shoulder and said he'd be ready by tomorrow", said Furyk.
His confidence is very high.
He's a big name and he's done a lot for this team over the years, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine that he would play in two games.
I imagine more than that, but that's the way it is and the way we thought we should do it.
He wants to be in the same class as everyone else.
Mickelson is going to beat Nick Faldo's record for most appearances in the Ryder Cup this Sunday.
This may be the last time he will compete in the Ryder Cup which never matched his personal record achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence brings an injection of spirit to his team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, and he's really fun to be in the team room", she said.
I think all the young players have fun with him, this week, and it's fun to watch.
He's not just playing but more than that.
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knew their lead would slowly fade
The European team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knew from his experience that the position of being far ahead could be lost on the final day of the Ryder Cup and make things difficult.
The Dane first competed in the 1997 event at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros was the captain and led the American team by 5 points but was only able to win by a very narrow margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself after the lead in front at Valderrama; we also got the lead in front at Brookline but we lost and in Valderram we won, but we won thinly", said Bjorn after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and last night to be ahead by 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on that team that this game is not over.
We'll fight to the death tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and don't make any mistakes.
It's not over until the eyes are picked and it's on the radio.
We have a goal to fill this trophy, and we're going to focus on that goal.
I told you, I'm going to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we all have to realize who we're up against - they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy with his men's achievements on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I can't possibly be surprised.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow the individual achievements have to be high and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when things are going well but when you're alone then your full potential as a golfer is put to the test.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give your best tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he has to give the best in himself too.
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play better as individual players than in team events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three points out of four.
Furyk himself had a last-day experience where the score was changed, being on the winning team in Brooklyn before losing unexpectedly when the European team performed a miracle in Medina.
"I remember every word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had set the players on fire on the final day.
We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you all want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it's going to put pressure on the event in the middle.
We're gonna line up our players in a way that we feel is appropriate, and we're gonna try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with fighting back and clashing with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the top-ranked European players of the first division.
"I made this rule because I thought it would fit and encompass everything", Bjorn said of individual player choices.
The new German battleship is delayed again
The German Navy was supposed to receive its newest frigate in 2014 to replace a Cold War-era warship, but the ship won't be ready until next year due to system breakdowns and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The commissioning of the battleship Rhineland-Pfalz, the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately post-commissioning problems hit the fate of this massive project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood to contain features such as high-powered cannon, various anti-aircraft and anti-ship equipment as well as some stealth features such as reduced radar detection, red lights and acoustic capabilities.
Other important features are the longer maintenance time span - the newest frigate must be able to sail up to two years from her keel.
However, various obstacles meant that this advanced warship - said to be capable of demonstrating German power abroad - would be obsolete by the time it entered naval service, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German Navy officials refused to take possession of the warship and returned it to the shipbuilding firm Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known about why the ship was returned, but the German press mentioned some software and hardware failures making the warship useless for combat missions.
Damage to the software had to be taken seriously as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship would be operated by only 120 frigates - half of what was needed to operate the older Bremen-class frigates.
There were also issues where the battleship was too heavy and this would reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate battleship is believed to be twice as heavy as the battleship of the same class ever used by the German army during World War II.
Aside from damage to the device, the overall cost of the project - including training for the crew - was also an issue.
The project is said to have reached €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from the original price of €2.2bn.
The problems with the new frigate warship show how much the German navy has lost.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the parliament's defense committee admitted that the navy was facing a serious shortage of manned warships.
The official also said the issue is getting worse, as the old warships that have been decommissioned are not getting replacement warships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is harvesting bat life
A recent study being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to explain why bats use the shape of the earth's surface to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to new discoveries about the behaviour of these unique flightless mammals and may serve as a guide for conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bat, and the soprano pipistrelles bat as well as the long-eared brown bat and the Daubenton bat at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at specific locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also be creating mobile surveys using mobile detection devices.
The expert analyzes the sound of all the recordings to identify the frequencies of each bat species and the actions of the bat.
A habitat map and reports will be generated to create a full-scale map of the Earth's surface of bats' behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes the results of this study will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as creating grazing pastures and the best ways to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
Bats are threatened by building and development work that disrupts bat habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lamps are also a risk to bats as are fly traps and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
Bat's not actually blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location-detection techniques using sound to identify insects and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is particularly concerned about bats.
They have ten trained experts who often conduct surveys, inspecting the exposed sites and occasionally rescuing bats.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first bat sanctuary at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says this estate is the perfect place for bats.
"Thereave we have a very suitable place for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of big trees and a suitable habitat.
There's a lot more we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to survive and thrive.
He stressed the importance of conducting a screening before starting any maintenance work on the property because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy a bat nest that would contain the young bats where this could kill 400 females and young bats, and possibly destroy the entire local bat population.
Bats are protected and it is an offence to kill, harass or disturb or destroy the nesting place of bats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official for the Bat Conservation Trust encouraged the public to help.
He said: "There's still a lot to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their populations evolve".
Ronaldo denies the rape charge while his lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the rape allegations against him were "fake news" and said people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel who published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was later said to have paid $375,000 to silence the victim according to Der Spiegel report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news".
That's not true.
What they're saying today is fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's the norm.
They want to be known by my name, it's part of my job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", said the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "a baseless report and intrusion into private space", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek damages for "moral damage that directly impacted his personality, which may be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a luxury room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of passing the woman by without permission, according to investigative documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident the player knelt in front of him and said he was 99 percent a good man and only got punished for one percent.
The document confirmed Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but on the basis of mutual affection.
Mayorga also claimed that he made a police report and took pictures of the injuries he sustained while in hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court because he was "afraid of the reaction" and worried about being "outed by the public".
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the previous settlement because she's still traumatized by what happened.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester when the allegations were made, and this summer he had moved to Italian football giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will regret forever if it loses its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that this was a bit "worrying" because Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution, it would stop car production at its factory in Burnsaston, near Derby, temporarily.
"We need a solution", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of this would lead to shipping problems at the border if there was no solution to Brexit and this would lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view if Britain leaves the European Union without any solution by the end of March, we will stop producing cars at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Several other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover have also expressed concern if the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of carmakers is about the risk to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production relies on an assembly basis based on timely delivery of supplies without any need for storage with car parts being brought in to the factory every 37 minutes from UK and EU level for the booked cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without any solution on 29 March, there is a high probability of border clashes that industry players predict will lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
Toyota could not possibly keep inventory supplies for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that the future plans of the Minister of Finance Theresa May for bilateral relations with the European Union should be made in a manner that avoids any checks at the border.
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow us not only to succeed for the moment but to take advantage of this opportunity", he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but for the long term warns it will increase costs and reduce the competitiveness of the plant and will consequently result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a union member responsible for union management at the factory, said union members are already worried: In my experience, lost jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and robust plan for the future relationship between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, the White House says
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed to next week" because of ongoing disagreements over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a federal court nominee, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereafter impede Mueller's freedom to pursue the investigation has been the hot topic in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein planned to use a secret recorder to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
But last Monday, he made his way to the White House, despite reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him clashing with the confessions of Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting her, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, to which they both gave confessions.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing yet another full vote in the Senate.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date is not set yet, maybe this week, I think it may be postponed for another week given some things going on in the federal court.
We'll see about that and I'll keep the press updated.
Some reporters will dispute that Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10th.
When the host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said he doesn't hold many press conferences not because he doesn't like TV reporters trying to get attention but he also said: "I disagree because they do want attention".
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would grow.
"The president has held more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him", he said without providing any evidence.
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've done a lot of it over the last few weeks, and it's going to replace the press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the press when he is leaving the White House or when he is participating in an open question-and-answer session or during a press conference with distinguished guests.
One-on-one press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes makes freaky and weird appearances in front of a gathering of reporters.
The health secretary wrote to EU employees in the NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The health secretary has written to all EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter of resignation less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has also committed to cover the costs of applying for EU citizenship working in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: As of the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on withdrawal were ongoing, and were heading towards a decision by the autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations to face a no-deal scenario.
I know this is something that is very concerning to all of you.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contributions of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Partners from across the European Union and other countries, bring together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health services and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury following a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the second half.
"He was near the edge and suddenly he collapsed there", Reed said.
Coach and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information on the nature/ extent of the injury at this time" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt freshman, played his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He's done five cooks on Saturday before he's out of the game, his total for the season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the excess money will be used to help the homeless under the Tory's latest plan.
This move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - money from this will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
This move seems to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money from this proceeds will help the government tackle the problem of homelessness.
This surcharge - is an addition to the stamp duty that has been imposed including the higher duty that has been introduced two years ago on second homes and houses purchased for rent which may be imposed at three per cent.
The Treasury is expected to be able to raise up to £120 million a year through this measure.
An estimated 13 per cent of new properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, causing prices to soar and making it difficult for those looking to buy their first home.
Most luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "sunny" because many of the owners are foreigners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty to be reduced so more young people could buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of deliberately keeping property prices high by buying land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to tackle Britain's embarrassing housing problem.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the abolition of the "no-fault" eviction.
He also wanted more power given to council members to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - that life must be better for every generation to come.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair because it is much easier for individuals not living in the UK, as well as companies based abroad to buy a home than for British residents who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is a distant one, and the fact of living in humiliation is a reality.
Jack Ross: My main goal is to run Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to re-establish the North-East club who are third in League One, three points short of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for a B cap and that's it so far", Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampden with my dad as a kid, and there's something that always draws me there.
That opportunity would only come if I succeeded as a manager at the club level.
Ross' replacements as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he did not feel the need to follow in the footsteps of such a well-known name at big clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success at this point is... can I get this club back into the Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should be in the Premier League, he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I'll consider myself successful if I can get this club back into the Premier League".
Ross is just three years into management, after being assistant manager at Dumbarton and being one of the coaches at Hearts for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa back to the third tier after relegation and changed the fortunes of St Mirren from relegated to becoming Champions the following season.
And Ross says he's much more comfortable now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was an option", he recalled, "when dealing with Alloa.
I know management is more like me than playing.
It may sound strange because I've made it, lived happily ever after and enjoyed some exciting moments.
Playing it was a little hard.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the pressure and the pressure of the job as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I've loved all my adult life.

The best time to drink beer is 5:30pm on a Saturday, according to a study.
This summer heat wave brings good luck to Britain's troubled pubs but also to chain restaurants under pressure.
Pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurants saw a 4.8 percent decline.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy firm that compiled the figures, said: "Continuing heat waves and a longer England World Cup campaign means July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs are up 2.8 per cent, unless restaurants are down even more.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June was compounded in July.
The performance of pubs that prioritize drinks and bars is strong compared to restaurants that decline.
Food-oriented pubs also suffered badly from the heat, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
Looks like most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a food and entertainment analyst at RSM, said: "The decision seems to be the same and has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and social or sporting events are still the main factors in increasing sales in the overseas market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant group continues to suffer, with sales down 4.8 percent year-on-year, which must be exacerbated by the cost pressure.
The long summer heat is hitting the restaurant operators at a bad time and only time will tell if the colder weather we experienced in August will bring relief.
The total increase in sales at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July this year, indicating a dampening in the newly introduced brand.

Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director during the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a renowned Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explained the move was an opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive experience at international level for over a decade.
"He is highly regarded in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from his participation in the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.
The American athlete, who won gold medals for the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, now has four Olympic gold medals and is now covering for the BBC, after being unable to walk due to a transcient ischemic attack.
He made a statement: "On this day last month I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time could tell how far I'd recover.
It's not easy to be like I was, I have to learn to walk again and today I have to do an intelligence exercise!

The milk pump ads that make comparisons to cows bring conflicting opinions online
A company that makes breast milk pumps got mixed opinions online because their ad compared a breastfeeding mother to a cow being milked.
To launch what they call the world's first wearable, silent breast milk pump, consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous music video to show the freedom that mothers can feel using this new pump.
Four mothers dancing in a haystack of cows to a song where the lyrics read: "Yes, I pump my own milk, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't realize this is not a nipple, this is my breast".
And the chorus is: "Pump out, pump out, I'm breastfeeding the kids, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping my breast".
However, the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has drawn mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it gives a cheerful glimpse of the dairy industry as "horrible".
It's an unreasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows must calve and give birth to produce milk, but unfortunately the calves are separated from the mother within a few days of birth, says one author.

Another commented: "Semnys is a real trauma for the cows and the calves.
But what's the word they use to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: An ad that should not be directly related.
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "very heartbreaking".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I still gave her body milk.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy, but I took it as it was.
This is a product of genius", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at moms who pump (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "cow".
This is not an ad praising or criticizing the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all been dancing with pumps hidden in their underwear.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the assumption that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Pam Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be hidden in the shirt in the breastplate, giving women freedom to move, hold their baby, and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it really deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the woman pumping to the dairy cow, we wanted to put the body milk pumping and all the challenges associated with it in the main focus, while showing the fun and connecting ways to feel free through the use of the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's bomb has made headlines.

The number of migrants detained is increasing despite monthly border movements not changing much, due to the rhetoric and heavy policies introduced by the Trump administration, making the placement of children with surrogates more difficult.
Traditionally, guarantors were undocumented immigrants, and they were afraid of compromising their status to stay in the country if they took a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective survivors and other adult family members would have to hand over their fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be sureties for uncustodied children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either guarantors or guarantor family members, are here illegally and most of them are illegal immigrants.
With that, we'll keep hunting the individual", Albence said.
To process the children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days by previous standards, according to the protection workers.
Many will attend via video conference call, rather than attend in person, to appeal their case for legal standing before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, and this will lead to acts of bullying or attempted escape, according to the protection officer and according to reports issued by the system in recent months.
Supporters say that the concern is higher in larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs that children are struggling with feelings may not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They add that moving children to the camp town without providing time for them to prepare emotionally, or to say goodbye to friends may only worsen the trauma they are experiencing.
Syria directs US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country has spanned eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the position of deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism "will be subjected to appropriate action".
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the conference.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue "fighting this holy war until we eliminate the territory of Syria" from both the violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically to train and advise Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
The French have over 1,000 troops on the ground in the warring countries.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were favorable for their return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that caused refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return", he said.
"They politicize what should be a matter of pure humanity".
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomat said the agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in rebel-held Idlib created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish talks have diverted a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the region where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement has a "clear time limit" and expected military action to target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to arrange the first meeting of a new committee, which will include government and opposition members to draft post-war amnesty and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing current constitutional articles", and warned against interference.
Because Trump is going to win a second term
With that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expected, impeachment charges and scandal ended his presidency prematurely.
In what is arguably the most dramatic end to a presidential term!
So far, no sign of a weak observer.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average prime-time audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had been ahead of cable ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", a story about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the mess.
True, unlike what's on TV, the story line that originated in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or the health of the global economy.
Not keeping up with the latest developments is just a treat for the lucky crowd.
However, it strays far from being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a panel of experts arguing about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" in finding the source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 camel-skin bomber jacket ("thick cloth with pomp", says The Washington Post) and a sensational account by Stormy Daniels of the ah, Trump anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he does is like in a reality show that looks like he's bribing you with something every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars", about Trump's story with casting changes and daily plot changes (starting a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode or you'll miss it.
When I visited Fleiss this week, the weather outside his house on northern Kauai was 80 degrees sunny, but he was stuck in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He can't leave TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we did a crazy show earlier and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but the real ones are stung".

Foreign money flooded into the intense contest of the mid-chamber election
It's no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania election showed a cash flow, given that the re-federation of congressional districts showed two incumbents now running for the same seat.
The redrawn suburban district of Pittsburg contested the Democratic incumbent Conor Lamb - who had won his seat in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb was running against another incumbent, Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old county had been grim-sandered in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th inning game has started a fierce campaign finance contest between the major party financial machines the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District that was watched by the public.
The seat has been held by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
A clever bunch of politicians have given the Democrats an edge.
The U.S. Expects to Finish El Savador For Supporting China, Then Withdraw
Diplomats from the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the Trump Organization management team.
Government Department officials decided to recall the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines are only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including narcotics control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have a negative impact on the Central American country with its high rates of harassment and murder.
After an internal meeting was held, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, for a follow-up to a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing immigrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided they wanted the conference to continue, effectively halting any consideration of fining El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now deliver a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, signaling the import of the administration's place in the meeting, according to the diplomat.
And the three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no message or firm penalty from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were backed by outside analysts close to the administration and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
What will happen next may be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which now has strong evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also disrupt an investigation to investigate whether the Trump campaign has joined Russia in attacks on our elections.
If Congress switches hands, Trump will face accountability on that side, once he's ready to face the voters, and possibly eventually a jury of his peers.
This is all if, and I'm not saying that the fall of Trump is inevitable -- or people like him in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make an attempted coup against Hitler, if the West did not follow Hitler and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the chance to prevent the brutal murder that would occur in the years to come.
The journey of history revolves around such inflection points, and the unchecked journey of democracy will be accelerated or delayed.
The American people are facing some of these inflection points right now.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the paper reported that, last year, he had been planning to film the president and speculating that the president was not fit for the job.
Rosenstein said the Times's account was inaccurate.
"What are we going to do if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the clear allegations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And more than that, are we going to vote for a midterm congressional election that Trump will be accountable for?
If we fail that test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had taken over my embassy.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, following a series with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers are using this decision as a stepping stone to a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We played this tournament with the belief that we were going to get something and we got one point.
We might win at the end of the game, but the series might be a fairer result.
They might have played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hoped we would get three points but the match was difficult because they got good results in the previous games but, the audience supporting us, I am sure we will play well and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, with all the stuff that happened with my injury, and the trade in the club but there's a fun factor about this place now.
The squad is good and the team is having fun; the training is good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed".
Women can't sleep because of this pension savings worry
While survey participants had a realistic idea of how they wanted to be cared for, some had even talked to their family members about it.
Half of the individuals in the Nationwide study reported that they had discussed with their spouse the cost of long-term maintenance.
Only 10 percent talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to support them but don't take steps to talk", said Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance business across the country.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and child: You will not be able to arrange for a family to care for you if you do not tell them first.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as that choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
Funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Finish your legal paperwork: Finish your legal war at a time.
Put a health care representative in place so you can appoint a person you trust to oversee your health care and appoint a professional at your discretion if you cannot communicate.
Consider also the power of attorney for your finances.
You're going to choose someone you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your grandmother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Describe these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
"Not only is the money set, but who is the doctor?" asked Martin.
"What is the cure?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have a plan".

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, with the death toll expected to rise.
With no communication systems, authorities were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, the area north of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu over 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a local government area 300 km (180 mi) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The prefecture, an administrative sub-region of the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the Donggala watershed.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is only concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Acheh province, Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of that number in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of casualties on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Kota Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills at least 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya governorate in Acheh, causing devastation and panic, reminding residents of the devastating events of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis were triggered at the time, but over 100 were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded at the time.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son is being held on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of domestic assault, interfering with domestic violence crime reports and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, while the woman's friend was trying to make a police call to report the crime allegation, he had taken the phone from the woman.
Palin was remanded in custody at Mat-Su's pre-trial facility and held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he has pleaded "definitely, absolutely, not guilty" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, the teenager was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
This case is being referred to the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing domestic violence reporting and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend claims the guy punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after associating her son's violent behavior with PTSD following his service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake tsunami: hundreds of victims
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks are also affected with deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media showed the time of the incident.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the coast.
The prosecution is seeking an extraordinary death sentence for the suspected NYC terror attack.
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attacks that killed eight people -- an extraordinary sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953 for federal crimes.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in its path on Oct.
To justify the murder conviction, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice with intent to sue for murder, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder by illegal activity, which is often used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of terrorism and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "careful planning and planning", according to the prosecutor, characterizing Saipov's conduct as "cruel, cruel and degrading".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice with intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a long time since the Southern District of New York has filed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced after they were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, pleaded not guilty in the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, according to police.
Saipov said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the allegation.
He also asked to display an ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of theft.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "deeply disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We feel the decision to pursue a murder conviction rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, only prolongs the trauma of this event for all involved", according to Patton.
Saipov's defense earlier requested that the prosecution not seek the death penalty.
According to Tory MP Nigel Farage, he should be in charge of running the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during the protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip chief said politicians should "feel the pulse" of the Eurosceptics - as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested she should be given the responsibility of running negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the UK would 'come out now' if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faces is to resolve the rift between members who support the Remain Tories who join the city's Brexit protests.
The prime minister is working to ensure the Chequers tolerance plan remains in place amidst the onslaught from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
May's staunch allies are holding talks with Brussels despite the repercussions - and the power of Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or 'chaos-blue'.
Bone told the Out rally means Out in Solihull who wants 'chequers'.
He recommended that Farage be knighted and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If he was given that responsibility, we're out now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit but we must scrap the Chequers.'
Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We are not fighting in the world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not true at all.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who was also attending the march, told reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers are not popular with the public, the Opposition will not vote for them, it is not popular in our party and the activists who are on the streets and who have voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message to May, he added: 'The prime minister will continue to hold them if they keep their promise.'
Farage said politicians need to 'feel the pulse' if they want to betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
'Now it is a trust between us - the people - and the political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here to tell them 'we will not let them get away with doing so.'
In a message to the excited audience he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the substance.
'We are preparing to prepare the people's army that will give us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, self-governing, proud.'
Meanwhile, Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a rally in the city centre.
A group of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch at the weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they were facing with the party's app as the conference began.
'They said they could have IT systems in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borderless conflict, for borderless trade,' he added.
'It's all theatre.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to study to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat laid out his plans for the future during a town hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP state Rep candidate Geoff Diehl, who was the Massachusetts co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign.
He's speculated to run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday's noon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the town hall format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to come to Washington to fix a broken government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrest made in the shooting death of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at the 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They've been scrambling video footage of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was ultimately killed as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson confessed to being at the scene, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who was raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship gap when the team orders him to win, beating Sebastian Vettel
It was clear at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, "the Mercedes team's command played a key role in this race.
From a shaky start, Bottas started well, nearly beating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into the pits first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should have been final.
Mercedes then went into the pits on the next lap and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire-to- tire action which left the Ferrari driver inside free at the risk of defending himself after the third corner defensive action.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was in seventh place after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and did not change tyres to aim for a quick finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He first entered the pits on lap 44 but was unable to improve speed for the next eight laps as Raikkonen was in fourth place.
A tough day for Valtteri who's had a good race all weekend and is a gentlemanly man allowing me to bypass.
The team did a great job of winning first and second places", said Hamilton.
That's the language of bad gestures.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over the woman's insistence that he not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly comment on the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people to be "cruel and ugly and liars".
"One thing that can happen and a beautiful thing happened a few days ago in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and ugly and liars", he said.
"When you look at the exposure and the leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I'm not leaking it".
All right, hold on a second.
Do we leak... No, we don't leak", he added, making the senator's expression.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh Ford last July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leaks came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak the story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"He told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as requested".
But the woman's denial was not liked by the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday: "I tell you, that's bad gesture language.
Maybe he didn't do that, but it was the worst gesture language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means.
You see, cruelty, outrage, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control", Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the rest of the league
Patrick Dwyer scores for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the Elite League defeat for Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led by two goals through shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home field before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win for them.
This is the third Elite League defeat for the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from the bottom to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting this season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three.
The opening for Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what looked like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the home field goal at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the assistant to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants won the game during the first half when he scored his second goal of the night in the bottom of the first.
The hosts later regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the situation by scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined to help Nielsen give Dundee their first late game win in the second half and he secured the win with the fifth team in the penultimate half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers killed to ensure hundreds on board the plane pass the quake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as heroes after their victims after ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of passengers successfully took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the rubble in Palu City.
Even though his partner escaped, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung, refused to leave his place of control in the heavily shaking control tower at the Pearl Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu.
He did not take any steps to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he sensed it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We're arranging a helicopter from Balikpapan in Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken hearing this news", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is still rising due to many bodies still under the rubble as well as many uncontactable", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The 20-foot-high wave has destroyed the Hammer who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will be bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing a body back.
Clean water is hard to come by.
Small shops are being remodeled everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, International Red Cross Indonesia Director, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors but we don't know what we'll find there.
It is a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing over 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one passenger is missing after plane crash
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia said one passenger was missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, the company was unsure about the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed over water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday, seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses feel the plane was diverted from the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway in low-level conditions.
"That was a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers managed to cross the waist-high water to the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were in a state of panic and screaming, and he only suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said crews near the refurbished dock also provided assistance by using refillable boats to transfer passengers to shore before the plane sank into 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network gives 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered plane crashes in the last two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts give a timeline of the night the women were burned alive
Prosecutors relaxed the case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of smart analytics.
He outlined to the jury how he used cellphone records to plot the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he was killed.
Rowlett said she received some location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone along with Chambers's phone while he was prosecuting along with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in front of the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had "cheated because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction is, Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that after Chamber's death, Tellis deleted the call texts and Chamber's contact information from his phone.
"He's erased that woman from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that afternoon.
The High Breed: Is hip hop sensitive?
The hip hop trio wanted to change the negative view of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claimed hip hop had shifted away from its original purpose, which was to send a political message and address social issues.
They want to get back to basics and make hip hop feel popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
NY nanny sues a couple who fired her for "racist" text
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message that was mis-sent from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied they were racist, calling the lawsuit "a hoax".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"No more black skin", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, but instead she sent the text to Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, feeling "uncomfortable", fired Maurice, saying that his previous nanny, an African-American, was not doing her job well and that he expected the presence of a nanny from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demands compensation in the amount of $350 a day for six months, compensation for the accommodation he has been offered, despite the lack of a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to allegations that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's services was justified because they felt the woman was untrustworthy after offending her remarks.
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist", the husband of Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put the custody of your child on someone you've abused, even if it was a crime?
Your newborn?
It's not".
Disguising the appeal as "a surprise", Plasco said his wife was just two months pregnant and in a "critical situation".
"You want to put someone in a situation like that?
Not a good thing", added the investment banker.
During the course of the case, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them for their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers are concerned readers are having difficulty communicating with talking bears, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put myself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It's heartbreaking when we now know of Paddington's success".
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book, a little toy bear, felt optimistic about his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bitter sweet" after his father's death last year.
Of Paddington, he described him as "the most important member of our family", he added, his father proud of his achievements in the end.
"The father is a quiet man, he is not a big talker", he said.
"But, since Paddington is too much alive for him, it's like the feeling you have of having a child who achieves something you're proud of even though it's not what you made.
I think he sees Paddington's success that way.
"Though the bear was his own creation and imagination, "he always credited Paddington himself".
My son is in a coma and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, the girl was rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, Nice where doctors were working hard to save her life.
"Nad called me frequently to say that the situation was bad and she would not be saved", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did just that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctor gave her to pump her heart slowly out and out of her system.
He died before his time and this is all off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was all going to happen.
I can't scream or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now, grieving the loss of her son, boarded the plane with another passenger - who was unaware of the bitter experience she had.
"No one knows", he said.
"I bowed my head, and tears flowed at every turn.
It's hard to describe, but on this journey I felt a sense of empathy for Nad.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her".
Sad woman sends postcard to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide, working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a letter on Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to contact for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel like I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, says his son is a potential killer with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always say his smile can light up any room".
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was in "a place that was completely dark".
In 2014, Tyler's then 11-year-old brother found his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that this will cause the effects of other things to happen".
Davis invented the card, "to let people know that there's someone you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit in silence - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
"He didn't tell me that he was feeling sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his temper.
He's so sad on Christmas day -- when the kids open their presents, he doesn't look at them or anything".
She said the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but they had to let it go: "It created a huge hole in the family.
It's what separates us.
But we have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance while the FBI starts an investigation.
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a time-limited investigation, a limited scope - we can bring it to the unit", Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee is "kid-friendly" in a stalemate based on a deep-rooted belief.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due to temperament.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6th -- if, as expected, the Republican results are unsatisfactory, they will be weaker in getting the person they want nominated to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush had made calls to the Senators, lobbying them in support of Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through Bush had met his wife Ashley, who became secretary to Bush.
What happens after the FBI produces the report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It's not clear if Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to tie the series and confirm his position on the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and high rates imposed by people smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than political refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the deferred nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to move towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for slowing the progress of the talks since the event.
"Without any confidence from the US, our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not begin the disarmament of nuclear weapons first", Ri said in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotional", and inappropriate to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his behavior was not appropriate for holding office in the Senate.
Pelosi made the following comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they'll call her 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and being in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "exaggerated and a well-planned defamation" that was managed by the still-angry liberal Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was unfit to hold office on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I feel he has disqualified himself and his actions against the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if she was confirmed, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House.
"I'm going to say this -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he wouldn't be fit to hold a position on the Supreme Court, but only on the court that he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she was viewed as a conservative court.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided saying whether he would reverse the Supreme Court's decision.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'What fun,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to show it.
It was a fitting insult, an inflammation that lasted months and years, and he did not hold his anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't feel it is anything extraordinary, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive at one place, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had invented a technique, if she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry".
Then he went on.
And I think that's a very smart suggestion".
Crying is allowed as a way to channel anger because it's always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of my old job, in a male-dominated office, I found myself crying with an uncontrollable sense of anger, pulled by an older woman on the side of my neck - a cold manager I was afraid of - dragging me into the stairwell.
"Don't show them your tears", she told me.
"They don't know you're a frog.
They think you're sad and you're going to feel happy because success makes you sad".
Patricia Schroeder, former congresswoman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having a secret affair on a boat called Monkey Business out of the contest, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to stop her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates running and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Due to events at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in her efforts to set up the fund, and she vowed not to run until she had earned $2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found out that his supporters who gave $1,000 to a guy would only give him $250.
"Do they feel I'm discounted?" he said.
When she said she wasn't going to launch a formal campaign, she felt a range of emotions - grateful to those who supported her, frustrated by the system that made it difficult for her to ask for donations and that targeted non-candidates, and angry at sexism - and she felt overwhelmed.
"You'd think I was having a heartbreak", Schroeder recalled of the way the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking at the time, what would I put on my birthstone?
"She was crying"?
The U.S.-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The onset of the US-China Trade War may be daunting, and although the fighting is not yet over, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs that will affect $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, with the effect of taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way every time, most recently, by imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the US every time it acts, and the world's second largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington back down means to submit to the will of the United States, but to submit to the United States is widely considered too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two countries.
"The speedy political decision by whether Washington or Beijing can start an uncontrolled economic situation in either country looks more dangerous than what previous observers have concluded", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of its political refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation inside the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism", he said.
The government will continue to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The situation now prepares for the voluntary return of refugees, to countries they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and their searching grounds.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries supporting the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5, 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team captain, Thomas Bjorn, got the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, released a tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving up to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer excelled in all rounds, becoming the first of four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out in 5&4 by the lowest placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one Dustin Johnson, down 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may be playing his last for the Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish player Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
"I rarely cry but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", Garcia said after the European victory.
He has handed the job to John Ram who has defeated US legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The pride I felt, when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching the guy play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods suffered defeats for all competitions in France and currently has a record of 13-21-3 Ryder Cup work.
Odd statistics by one of the greatest players ever, winning 14 major championships second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game of golf throughout the game.
Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his crew, "I'm proud of them, they work hard.
We're delivering supplies to the European team this morning.
We're doing the best we can.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All 12 of his players played brilliantly.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love all 12 of these men and am proud to be captain.
You should raise your hat.
We have been defeated".
Red Deer Reduction: decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission indicates a general decline in Red Deer populations in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, clustered expansion conditions were reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County areas - indicating a reduction in concentration.
The Red Deer Development runs along approximately 130 miles of coastline from north of Pinellas to south of Lee County.
The cluster can be found 10 miles offshore in Hillsborough County, but in a less-populated area than last week.
The Red Deer are also seen in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or out to sea Pinellas County were reported in recent weeks, low to high concentrations in or out to sea Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or out to sea Sarasota County, background to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or out to sea Lee County, low concentrations in Collier County.
