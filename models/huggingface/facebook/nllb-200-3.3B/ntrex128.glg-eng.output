The members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they'll be taken for fools.
Dismay among some of the Assembly members, now referred to in English as AM, at the suggestion that they should change the name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose from plans to rename the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all walks of life fear being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said that his group was concerned that the new name rima with Twp and with Pwp.
For those who don't know Welsh, twp means parvo and pwp means caca.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the whole group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was keeping an open mind about the name change, but pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the Welsh name.
Regarding the issue of the AM title, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received majority support in a public consultation.
It appears that the MPs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could prove a headache for the Speaker, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disqualification of MPs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote will decide to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent while the churches of Harlem continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other.
He said he could understand why the bars were gone.
"People are socializing in other ways now", he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders hope, and sooner or later they'll be back where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with homeowner communities full of the kind of people who wouldn't help keep neighborhoods sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will accelerate the closing of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building badly, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly christened the carillon "the poor man's bell".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it otherwise: "A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who replaced it with the Riverside church's grandest carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that no one has taken his place at St. Martin.
The ones that have been occupying St. Martin's for the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish and composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese "seeks to pass on costs to the council, although the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent to the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A boy is injured by a shark while fishing for lobsters in California
Police report a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while scuba-diving for lobster in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement from catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting "They caught me!"
They got me!
He had a shattered clavicle, and Hammel said he realized it when he came to the boy.
"I'll tell everyone who comes out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescue worker, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but had determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials closed the access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty aisles similar to department stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable plunge into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home sales fall, the biggest beauty runners will be testing in 11 stores across the country, and then moving on to others next year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for what to fill the shelves that once filled televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated it would double its beauty product offering to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current collections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive zones similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by the younger clientele.
In addition, the fragrance shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's outlets; the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said establishments will increasingly look like shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores since it bought the two chains two years ago, and this has apparently boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to share the revenues of the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and attractive and convenient locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits".
Peter Jones furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11 million business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in a rage after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his Truly brand of home clothes and accessories.
Her company has been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones sparking by withdrawing from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at £1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to her housewares and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was definitely one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the project stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and home textiles, and could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are the parents of three children and have had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter on ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones stated last night that "we should not comment on his business affairs".
A complicated conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not appropriate for a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given in so easily?
Trump said in his voice as a news anchorman.
"I have not given up anything".
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after their initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three weeks after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things are going well with North Korea", he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship.
He claimed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: ending missile testing, helping to free hostages, and bringing home remaining U.S. troops.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, gesturing to the crowd he had just in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national agency for disaster management, assured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia endures constantly, the country is extremely ill-equipped to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly found on other islands.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands poses a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was deployed in Lombok to help earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorated infrastructure, and lavished money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is plagued by a severe lack of funds in the run-up to next year's re-election.
Mr Joko is also concerned about the continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes because of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still within 27 metres of Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot to the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the top left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga who was jumping in the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, get organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to gain as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came up to Kante and I said a word without thinking too much and I just fired".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed Mateo Kovacic on the heel on that play, before turning around mid-shift and rushing into Liverpool's pitch.
Kovacic put a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a nice deep pass leading Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second stick scoring with a left-hand shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything to step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated, 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call for anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have captured anything with the control room camera to contact us, as they may have information that is key to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a resident of Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation is continuing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have just been told they won't be able to re-enter the building for a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area was considered a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene, crying.
He keeps saying it's horrible.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymously with Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 citing the 247 record of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in the Houses of Parliament becomes the last monument to be affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
Its banning would be poetic justice for its Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its fanatic and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "disappointing" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclastic English Civil Wars were not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of their forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century view, and part of the historiography of a figure many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr Goldsmith stated to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than now, as the defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a fully complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A killer pig is slaughtering a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his nickname, "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a curb in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently travelled with his cousin the merchant from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent doorway.
He said there was a big male in the barn with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
"My cousin had his legs bloodied and slashed", the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", told the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the couple's farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had run a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife arrived and scared the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they have no intention of doing harm.
You just have to show them the respect they deserve, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and widespread rain to the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it flies over the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of over 135 km/h and was located about 400 miles (620 km) from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward, towards the East Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 liters of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the trough will create heavy and widespread rain in the southwest for the next few days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation approaching 50 to 75 l/m2 in some areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Parts of the Southwest expect 50 to 100 l/m2 of rainfall, especially over much of Arizona.
Potential for flash flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form canyons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally-sparked winds and dust.
The downpour will bring locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause minor debris flows and erratic roads.
These would be the first rains of the region's wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the late hours of Sunday and early hours of Monday, before the rain spreads into late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday, lasting until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature swings in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves large temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we'll be able to see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the central United States.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to re-emerge and expand again.
For the central and eastern parts of the country, a warm early October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks the passionate testimony of Supreme Court Justice-appointed Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues and the networks interrupt their regular programming for a Friday night news story: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's 100% sure that Kavanaugh groped him while he was drunk and tried to strip him at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20.4 million people had seen it.
The company has gained media audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that rebroadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people watching TV from offices.
To give you an idea, it's an audience similar to a football final or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement indicating that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning being beaten by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained with his eyes down for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you today", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, 'You have power while there are many women who are helpless.'"
Flake said his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the TV and cable networks were broadcasting live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate to submit it to a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, something a minority of Democrats were urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After further discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and damaging the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside his own on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the tariffs from each other was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murdered: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder.
Officers released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was given bail of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head that extends to the neck.
The department has commended the Louisiana State Police's fugitive unit, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police and the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-foot-1 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
"This is what we worry about all the time", Wade declared.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
The ash that Popocatepetl volcano spews has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunder and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray on windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists contained by riot police, roasting eggs and paint powder that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also skirmishes later that day with the police, who used their batons to contain the riot.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Neither forget nor forgive" clashed with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received at the protest, according to local press.
Tension continues to flare up in the region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent confrontations.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place equally but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence rally with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite winning a narrow, if decisive, victory in regional elections last December, this year Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their involvement in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"There's more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashes into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm (UK time).
Police investigator Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the fence and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a stunt was fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory.
The rising Livingston surprised Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to move up a level after Hibernian, in second position.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten away from home this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, from whom they are separated by eight points.
But first the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remain undefeated in the division for the sixth consecutive game; head coach Holt has yet to suffer a defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last season.
Livingston is missing opportunities in front of handicapped visitors.
Holt's team must have been ahead of the game long before they scored, as their control caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the scoring but his cross shot did not cross the goal line; next, Alan Lithgow's shot went out propelled by a head shot from Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The home team were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger the visitors on the free-kick.
And that's how the deciding goal came.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston made a serve in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to pinch Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that point the Rangers were dominating the possession but found themselves with an impenetrable defence that was taking a lot of work away from goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop on Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor held off a shot from Scott Pittman with his fist, and Lithgow sent the ball out on another of Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross-passes were produced in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were refused: one for a hand and one for a Halkett inning to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal by the Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they've been excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, but part of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organised defence while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall no respite throughout the game.
The Rangers lack inspiration.
Despite working well on occasion under Gerrard, this time they did not reach that level.
They missed the final pass, only managed to penetrate the home team once, all the way to a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are halfway down the board.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the lunch meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to mend relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflected the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies after being hit by car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford street in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 (UK time).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run in Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are road closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the riots
Six prison officers were injured in a brawl at the maximum security prison, according to the prison official.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30am (UK summer time) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
A Tornado unit of specialized officers has come to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are being held in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the penitentiary center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police officers had to go to the prison to quell a riot in which staff were beaten with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is most likely to occur early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service indicated in a Twitter post that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained depression or tropical storm status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended within 40 miles (64 km) of the Arizona border".
The latest National Weather Service models predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 in the Mogollon Range of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with 100 l/m2 total isolates being possible.
For those who are out of danger of flash floods, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, as the region is very affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain could be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which still has hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (136 km/h), is 400 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 12 mph (19 km/h).
The storm is meeting with cold water in the Pacific and therefore, losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Heavy rainfall could occur in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant flooding risk.
"Total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 250 l/m2 possible", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue to climb through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or its remnants is heavy precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
It is hoped that these rains could cause sudden water spills and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Assault in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 04:00 (UK summer time).
He was taken to hospital, where he remains stable".
According to Somerset Police, overnight three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area.
The officers asked for the cooperation of anyone who had a mobile phone recording of the incident.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the wrath and scorn of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the petty anger and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his accusation.
The president said Saturday that on that day, the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the finest jurists of our time with an unblemished record of public service", he said addressing the West Virginia crowd of admirers.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
"We have five weeks left before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don't compete, but I really do, he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "obstacle and obstruct".
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican Party aide told CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has killed hundreds and the death toll is rising.
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them swept away by giant waves that broke on beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered Friday to attend a beach festival in the town of Palu as waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters) broke ashore in the fog, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were killed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a gathering in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it swept away cars, logs, houses, everything it found", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled on the high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the national agency for disaster management showed many destroyed tents and buildings, bridges toppled and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Appraisal and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications were "totally shut down and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross reported in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", he declared.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In a fan recording shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building, frantically screaming warning people on the street of the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, water hits the beach, carrying buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that caused communications to be cut off throughout Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the army has already started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has now reached 800.
It's awful.
On the way to reach the city of Palu, where employees are sheltering in canvas shelters built in the courtyard of his office, World Vision staff witnessed scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's awful.
Even as the groups began the unpleasant task of setting up disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with extensive knowledge and experience from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of a province", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open ourselves to international help, but that time has not yet come.
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that would ease the dismal narrative of natural disasters.
A child was pulled out of a sink on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As someone with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional baggage", he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the paragliding community, he desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages only showed one grey mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered", he added.
They rob a bank of $26,750 while they're reloading a cash register in Newport on the Levee.
Early Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was loading a cash register in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, investigative officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cash register at the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's servant and stole a bag of money he was supposed to deliver.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects leave the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I used to be known as Kanye West.
For some time, the 41-year-old West has been known by the nickname of Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'", West said that same year while talking about his record with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, we are you, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that's in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye is another famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, though this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also took the trouble to put in and take out the script and use the uppercase letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
López Obrador promised Saturday in the plaza of Tlatelolco that he would never again use the military to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to boys who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are dragging young men into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in A.I.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a former executive at Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount it invests in AI in light of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made announcements about AI, even though the US lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China laid out its plan the year before: it aims to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the other countries are way behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the odds that the next AI breakthrough will be made in the U.S"., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-scoring American Othello player, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research's Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when he would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, says Lee.
"China is not driving academic leaders, it is driving companies", he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work on AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the US boost its efforts in AI.
"I think they should offer residency cards to PhDs at IA", he said.
The State Council of China published its Next-Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents allege that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result would meet the 50 percent minimum needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO from Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament have said they will abide by the result of the vote and make it final.
A change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The state election commission said that at 1 p.m. there were no irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes for the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high and not through the service door", Kavadarkov added.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of joining the EU and NATO", Zaev commented after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required figure.
Another poll by the Macedonian TV network Telma indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to go to the polls on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Agüero crosses all of Brighton's defence and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling provided the backroom for Brighton's 2-0 defeat by Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the 65th minute goal.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenses before heading into the open.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green sweaters.
He defied one defence before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch of the area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems in his foot", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to get him at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball deep into Brighton's court on that play.
He sent a nice right-hand pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several touches before driving Sterling towards the opposite post.
The Blue Jays got the ball in the goal before they left the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to throw the party for the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoff race, there wasn't much reason to force another ownership.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who take a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division.
The Rockies secured at least one wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close out their division title.
"Even if we don't play each other, we can at least touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing probably at the highest level I've played this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starter on Sunday, but they seem to be leaning towards Scherzer being the one to pitch in a situation like that.
Scherzer, who would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely pitch on Sunday on his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the result in the midterm elections.
"We played everything we did in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is a big, big... I'm not running, but I really am and that's why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say: "You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary, by malice, by meanness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're never going to give it to them".
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder".
"And you've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, worthless, disgusting, and liars".
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which received strong public applause.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
What?
No, mmm, no, wait -- that was the worst body language, the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is not so open anymore.
He's not tolerant of people expressing their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, and all for speaking our mind.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, which were, incidentally, issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I've been a Labour MP, the Friday night committee meetings have been exactly like that.
Sadly, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a more polite and gentle politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and judges whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to back me up and take positions with which I would never agree, whether on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a tremendous outcry and attacks on social media censoring the centre-right politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political in nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needed to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that open and that with every move of "no trust" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past few years I've received a lot of advice that I should keep my head down, not be so blunt and then everything would be fine for me.
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still at school, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government which had literally dropped my class, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East would be confused by my political views and that I disagree with the current party leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would only say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But in reality, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting in what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr are in the lead
It is possible that the last two attempts altered the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this enjoyable Premier League match from Tenent.
They're now leading the table and the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his risk-taking, that brought the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have been tested in our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "It must be admitted that Ayr has made the most of his opportunities.
A 14th-minute try from Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, conceded for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers count and Jason Baggot managed a wrong throw.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at half-time, he converted a solitary shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and a try from Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
This was followed by a prolonged stoppage by the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on the paddle and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further by a Stafford McDowall try, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having a player with a try from Bruce Colvine who was not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored a try from the penalty line on the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had done almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the throw in David Armstrong's area and sent it to third-line Gregor Henry to get the fifth try from the home team.
The Still Game star begins a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be set to enter the restaurant industry after it is revealed that he has been appointed CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the definitive one, and it seems that Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun insinuated that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving Glasgow restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': Inland Bolivia expects court to send it to Pacific
The sailors were watching a naval headquarters covered with equipment in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are awash with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to recover it".
In landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict over resources lives on, as does the longing to sail across the Pacific Ocean again.
If those hopes are at their highest point in decades, Bolivia is expecting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, hopes for a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICS ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outlet to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has much at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will give Bolivia the right, and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICC ruling comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", says Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have been behind.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current Bolivian administration for a long time", Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined the goodwill that was left for Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile, and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his nation will not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that it is a utopia that continued US sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will succeed in doubling the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that opened the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have been all over Instagram this summer, and these designers have taken their most amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide wing imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other large accessories included embroidered watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, but these were not designed to protect the head from cold.
Thom Browne has also revealed a selection of bizarre masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn on and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looked like a full-size scuba gear, with goggles and a tube, and the other one was a melted ice cone.
And if you're a fan of the big guy, you're in luck.
Fashion pundits predicted that the giant caps would make it to the store shelves.
The disproportionate hats come right after the Bomba, the straw hat with a 60 centimeter flap worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that's flooding all social media has brought out another great creation: a beach bag made of straw almost as big as the model in a bathing suit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, 'I hope the oversized hats and beach bags will hit stores next summer, as the designer has made such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools have a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community subjects.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible education for pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career of their choice and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
But if you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent examinations of this year, we can see that the languages are at the top of the charts and with the highest pass rates in the private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students achieved an honours degree in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all-round school curricula.
A survey carried out by the UK's Commission for Employment and Training in 2014 indicated that amongst employers, a lack of language skills is 17% of the reasons why employers have difficulty filling vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for kids today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ according to the school.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your children, private schools always have several languages to choose from and specialists in this field.
Scottish private schools specialise in providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, that languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edwards is the headmaster of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Lebron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's head coach, Like Walton, announced that James would play in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But there's still a lot of minutes to be decided.
"It's going to be over 1 and under 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to be ready", he said.
Trump's election events are coming to Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five rallies Trump has scheduled for next week, including stops in nearby cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it is voted on in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of this week's trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and is holding up the Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with new momentum.
So, the five rallies Trump will give next week are aimed at "empowering volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible for the campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, to be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and garner media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is last in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stamina to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating momentum pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept but one that athletes really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I guess we took that as a little bit of a boost", said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little bit of wind in their favor and much to cheer for, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each counted three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and he's leading by example.
Those guttural shouts grew louder as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
On getting the putt that won them the game in the 15th, he made a similar cry, the kind of cry that says he believes the American team is not yet out.
"You just have to focus and worry about your party", Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
The odd but adorable European couple have four of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That run, and the way it seems to flow its energy into and out of the crowd, confirms them as rivals to Sunday's strike, and there could be no more popular players to score a win when the sun goes down on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first run put the Spaniard and Swede in a hole they've never been close to getting out of.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stamina to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to climb four points on the leaderboard at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, looking to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, overcame a U.S. team that was missing in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but could not cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed on fourballs, they matched perfectly to defeat a dishevelled Woods and rookie American Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday with no grief or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's fourballs, rejoined his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, taking a loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant breezy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They took a 2&1 victory over Spaniard John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and won back Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history that a team has gone four points clear of the lead in the singles, although as the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's team only need to tie to retain it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were increasing his distrust of the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US", he added.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disengagement first on our part".
While Ri took up North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean Peninsula while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted relaxing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive objective, and even oppose the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions sharpen our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the other side of this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a stalemate.
Still, Ri's tone was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after "evil president" Trump called Kim "rocket man on a suicide mission".
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to totally destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that it would take two years, three months or five months".
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, on Thursday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: "Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we see complete, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had advanced, just hours before North Korea denounced him for making "mafia-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He noted that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and the move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are running a course on how to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all of its students sleep more in order to combat the growing macho culture of caffeinated, all-night studying.
One academic has found that students at the world's top universities often lack basic knowledge about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the course, a young girl approached me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which launched for the first time this year, teaches students the basics of how getting good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were experiencing significant sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, formers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it's not going to change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure for students to sleep were a growing problem.
Ensuring that students get enough sleep and get good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" in fighting stress, fatigue, and anxiety, she says, and even preventing weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain into a starvation mode, which causes the student to be hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to bed, as well as when they wake up.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks the Gerrard's men to the ground
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disorganised side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were aiming for their first home win since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side suffered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, which left them eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga attacked seven minutes before halftime and a poorly-inspired line-up of Rangers never gave the impression that it was a draw.
While Rangers have dropped to sixth, Livingston have climbed to third and are only one goal behind Hibernian.
And it could have been a lot worse for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after allegedly throwing an object.
Gerrard made eight changes from the team that swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was the same Livingston XI who netted Hearts a point last week and would have been delighted with the way his organised set-up smothered his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may be dominating the possession, but Livingston did much more when he had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-half short-pass sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered this great opportunity.
A powerful free-kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only nail it on the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their play in the offensive zone.
No doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt that they should have taken a penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
Rangers only made two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with head-kicking from Lassana Coulibaly and attacking from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again to match Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick Menga for a single.
Gerrard acted in the break by switching Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a switch that almost had an immediate effect as the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour the visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to push Jacobs back before Lithgow headed in from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty after tangling with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting -- that was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By wearing these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals".
Evans: "Say, it's probably going to pop right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to "see" faulty cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the faulty cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab.
They can see a protein that's common to many cancers and re-inject it
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech by wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was spotted in the studio after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again cap, she criticized the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white guy and say, 'How can you like Trump if he's a racist?'
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded images of West's criticism to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time backstage because of his hat.
"They passed me on the set.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat".
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was going crazy", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see me get stung?" saying that he would "use my Superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love".
His comments drew applause from the audience at least twice, and the SNL cast members seemed to be embarrassed, he told Variety, with one person there telling the publication, "The whole studio was absolutely silent".
West had been named as the final replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people baffled with a performance of the song I love it, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits: THANKS FOR FACING A GAME WITH THE MAFIA".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful".
"However, I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder for the stabbing at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is taking a swipe at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that said roles on screen translate into it seeming that young men often have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has gone wrong" and wonders how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "strong enough" to tackle the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. What did we do wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its overly masculine characters.
He went on to say, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young men feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
Because clearly something went wrong with the boys".
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that he is "fed up with horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way, it provided me with my future family and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family heritage estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health officials said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but they claim that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican Party senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican Party senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the statements were being made by "far-right" websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' department and revealed information from a member of Waters' staff, Capitol Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was made with anger", Fleischer wrote.
"He gives the impression that he has no temperament for being a member of Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, you shouldn't get angry.
He must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
You must remain calm and composed".
It appeared Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it was right" he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department had alerted "law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the culprits are found", he continued, "as well as that they are held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team".
Johnny English Strikes Again, the spoof of the powerless spy by Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for the Brexit transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of this Johnny English parody and action comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn (Johnny English Returns).
Will the ironic satire about the matter of how obviously stupid we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the uncompetent, bulbous-eyed, gummy-faced character of Johnny English has renewed his license to screw things up a second time, and his name is a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemaphile territories.
Of course, it's the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to glamorous flatterism, has a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a little that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he sowed chaos in his wake.
There's a couple of good moments in the last Johnny English outing.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor blades make a brief thud against its hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but it gives the impression that humor has little power and is strangely superfluous, especially when such "serious" films as 007 and Mission Impossible already use comedy convincingly as one of their ingredients.
It seems as though the humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or focused as Atkinson's silent film jokes in portraying Bean.
Now the perennially topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's network of top-secret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent on duty, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the ultimate for a pompous, conflicted prime minister, who is already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but there's not much you can do with the script.
His intelligence advisors tell him that since all active spies have been compromised, he must bring someone out of retirement.
And that's referring to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives off-the-record lectures on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and he is reunited with his long-suffering colleague Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service's mischief are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is perilously falling for the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous antics: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally brings them aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes total anarchy by attempting to use virtual reality headsets to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Of course, all the arrests are from that last sequence, but the way it's kind and scandalous, it seems to be from a children's TV show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make the British work four days a week, but pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but pay for five.
Presumably, the party wants employers to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in workers' favor.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day week as a measure to allow workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policies is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during their campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not part of party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply the possibility that current shareholders of the water companies will not recover all their investment, as a Labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand out 10% of private sector companies' shares to employees, which pack in annual dividends worth up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed for at least a week the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday's air interview, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"They say I'm going to the hearing.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, resounding".
However, Graham's vote seems to be immutable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I see nothing new".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive lineup of up-and-coming stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience attending had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the success rate of Global Citizen 12 years after it achieved its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand action or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism", people who think they make a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its followers, driving a different set of goals.
It states that these actions helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2,250,000,000 people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that so far the funds secured have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and developer company that has pledged to "help children develop to their full potential", with a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote of history", The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions on their website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just as with the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that preceded us, we will succeed, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to implement a "blockade" to hinder Russia's energy exports, the US Secretary of the Interior has announced.
"If necessary", Washington can resort to offshore to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's engagement in Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to deal with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe", he reportedly said.
Furthermore, according to the officer, they have the means and the means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice, they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace the fuels", he said, while referring to Russia as "only having a tactic" with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
The statements were made as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is justified only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance drew a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to distance itself from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider her 2020 presidential bid, Massachusetts senator says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government and that includes a woman in power", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider my candidacy for president".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented in a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator would not run, according to the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research and the Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported that nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names from the Democrats in relation to a possible candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by Track Palin at the rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through again, I can see reflected in other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers come back with", he explained to the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "come back different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what fellow militia and airmen, as well as other members of the military, have offered to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia defy new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a lawsuit over a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or organized crime.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington in support of a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Sessions v. Grace case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and their children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
He's being held in Texas.
Lawyers in the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers to the US, as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such prohibition violates that principle", the court's friend report explained.
The prosecutors went on to argue in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions declared in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as casualty numbers double in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"Circumstances are very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her feverish baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"An ambulance with bodies arrives every minute.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuous and strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake had shaken the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I listened to my wife cry for help and then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of abusing "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper touting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the US president, referred to the China Daily pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, the largest selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the US congressional elections, which will be held on November 6, a fact that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials coined at Reuters as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war as a result of the leveling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China's counter-tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an opinion piece written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was exposed that China "is intensifying this campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda ads in the American free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and the press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newsstand at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese people may have about China's troubling economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he adds.
He also claims that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, though he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh's disaster loses the Republican female vote just days before the midterm elections.
While many leading Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite various allegations of sexual assault, analysts are warning of a backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions to these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to go ahead with the vote.
"These things can't be undone", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November", reflected Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, opponents of the "November is coming!" flu rallied in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The Democrats' motivation and enthusiasm will exceed any expectations", said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that he's already tall,
But it's still going to be more, especially among undecided women voters from the suburbs or those between 18 and 29 years old, who even though they don't like the president, they don't usually go to the polls".
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash was possible if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week on NBC News.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her", noted Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of people surveyed either fully or probably believe Ford's testimony, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
Also, 38 percent believe it's more likely that Kavanaugh will lie during his testimony, versus 30 percent who think the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was drunk when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a college party when he was a student at Yale in the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google. He is the founder of the company that is called "The Internet".
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee hinted that the intention behind Inrupt is to "take over the world".
"We have to do it", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
Contacts lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser at the same time.
What makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company will provide the appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
"We don't need your permission".
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide a commercial power and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new web based on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as well as the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, clergyman decorated with the Victory Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War received a posthumous tribute in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was assassinated by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with unveiling a memorial in his honour at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, underlined the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of intense machine gun fire".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "great courage", led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without help from anyone, and shooting down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I could never live with, but a lesson nonetheless".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which was headlined by the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero is demonstrated by the support of so many people".
Peppa Pig is cutting the tape for MMA fans at the best time
Imagine you've been up all night to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when you get to the best part something stops you.
The San Jose card featured 13 fights, six of them majors, and was being rebroadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, the UK audience was stunned when Peppa Pig appeared.
Some were not impressed after spending so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these childish drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke".
"State regulations dictate that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and so it had to be changed to children's programming", explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's what it is".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, stated that they will take into account UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition", Coker said.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working on a solution.
When the change occurred, I started receiving a lot of messages, and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six, and we wanted to give our fans as much as possible, but we're overreacting and
They give us a lot of anger".
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims that he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
A guest on the first broadcast of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he started speaking out about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to put the importance of winning the Olympics into relative perspective.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first Laverne-led show, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to other people because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
She also stated: "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what has driven me and given me the strength to succeed".
I wanted to prove that I was "someone" so that people wouldn't feel disappointed when they found out about their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "was a complete surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20-year age gap between them was never a problem.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (at only 14 years old he participated in his first Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone your age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth changed Daley's outlook entirely.
"If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal", he says.
"But now I know that there are things far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for from his son was tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that I wouldn't be here to take that first row", shared Daley.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized he was not really invincible", she adds.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was my life's dream: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", she confirms.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes his hair stand on end.
Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
A Mickelson in poor shape ended up on the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will need to improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who is competing in the biennial event for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in either the fourball or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his moves.
Though he was never the most accurate of players, not even at the peak of his career, at 48 he does not fit into the tight-knit Le Golf National, where the tall grass often punishes the wrong shots.
And if that wasn't enough, Mickelson faces in Sunday's ninth match the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 singles matches, start well, Mickelson's performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly my role today, patted me on the shoulder, passed my arm, and told me that I would be ready tomorrow", Furyk shared.
"He had complete confidence in himself.
He's got a spot in the Hall of Fame and he's been a big part of the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end, that's the way it is and that's the way we think it should be.
Like everybody else, he wants to be out there".
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, a career that never quite matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk claims his presence also provides intagibles for the team.
"He's a fun guy, sarcastic, with wit and likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I like to see the good the younger players had with him this week.
It's much more with a good player".
Europe's captain, Thomas Bjorn, fears the advantage will be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead in the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Great Dane made their debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the goal line with a minimal advantage winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by a little", reflects Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over.
Tomorrow we have to go through them all.
We have to go out there and do the right thing.
This isn't over until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I will not tire of saying it, I am focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I am also very aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world".
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and we have to prove our worth there too.
It's great to have a partner by your side when things are going well, but when you're facing things on your own, then you're testing your golf skills to the limit.
That's the message you need to give the players, to bring out the best in themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he has to make the best of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than their teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those rounds on the final day, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but finishing as the loser after the European miracle in Medinah".
"I remember every damn word", he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players for the final day.
"We have 12 big games, but you want to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see momentum going in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those intermediate parts.
We've prepared our lineup with this in mind and we've put the players in the way we think we want to do tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
"I decided on this order because I think it covers the whole way", explained Bjorn about his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was due to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy newer frigates up to two years outside of the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuing delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind this return, but German media reported "crucial software and hardware defects" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the personnel needed on the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have a dramatic overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as many as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming an issue.
It is claimed that it has already reached the staggering figure of €3100 billion, up from the initial €2200 billion.
The problems of the younger frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is running out.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships to deploy.
The officer says that this problem is growing, as the old ships have been removed, but not replaced by new ones.
He also lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to forage.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats, as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map is then drawn to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results show which areas of habitat are more important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grasslands and which is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development affecting the nest and habitat loss.
Air generators and tree-lining also pose a risk, as do glue-covered fly traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind,
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organisation even has Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, estate manager, claims this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a large area for bats", he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
He emphasizes the importance of controlling the presence of bats before undertaking maintenance tasks on properties, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single mothering calf can kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There is still much to learn about bats, and for many species, we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims and his lawyers are preparing to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him false, claiming that all people want is to be known using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
The footballer allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after its publication, Ronaldo, 33, flagged this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, no, and a thousand times no.
What was said today is false", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"People want to be known by my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2019 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, bowed out saying that he was a 99 percent gentleman, but that that 1 percent had betrayed him.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the two had consensual sexual relations.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and told them about the photos of the injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was terrified of reprisals and worried about public mockery.
The 34-year-old says she's seeking to revoke the agreement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the UK
The UK would forever mourn the loss of its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need to come to an agreement", Clark added.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of no-deal Brexit, the impact of border delays could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will witness production come to a halt at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the supply chain risk in the event of no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes parts arrive from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of parts could result.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at the border".
"It's imperative that we have a deal and we want to have the best deal so that we can enjoy the success we have now but also make the most of this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Toyota's experience and other manufacturers' experience is that you need to continue these excellent supply chains".
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a Burnaston employee for 24 years and Unite's union coordinator, said his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I know that once these jobs go away, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
The White House has said that the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein could be delayed by another week due to the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Russian aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was on the verge of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday, was announced.
Trump stated that he would prefer not to have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, was featured on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week or it could be delayed another week, given everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed".
Some journalists have questioned that assertion, as Sanders has not held a press conference since September 10.
When Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of a news briefing was not due to an aversion to the grandiloquence of reporters, though she added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president", he said, though he did not cite any source that could support the data.
Briefings will continue, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than directing the questions to her.
You are witness to how we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a freewheeling and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretary to calm Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and its wish for them to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of us.
So I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the European Union and beyond, bring indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
Apparently, he fainted as he reached the line.
Coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen on the sideline before taking him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State coach informed Chris Harris, a reporter for WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also said there are no details yet on the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total innings on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total for the season to 18.
A stamp duty will apply to foreign buyers who buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK. This extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on the high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to people and businesses who do not pay UK tax, and the money raised will go to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent, could be as high as 3%.
The company expects the change to bring in up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, which is causing prices to rise and making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to access the property market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the estate transfer tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to remove the percentage tax revenue on moderately priced houses to fix the "shame of the housing sector" that is being lived in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on rent-seeking where the tenant is not at fault.
It also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new housing.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, we need to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is just as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based overseas, to buy homes as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to be able to coach Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is relishing the challenge of reviving the North West club, who currently sit third in League One, three points away from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once for the B team, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a boy, something I always wanted to relive.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's head coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio. He was also the first head coach to be appointed to the post of manager of the club.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims he felt no unease at succeeding such well-established figures at such a large club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will my success at this point depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly those of a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to get there, but I'll probably only consider myself a success here if I can get the club back to the Premier".
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
During that period he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and helped St Mirren to go from being on the verge of relegation to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he has ever been during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads", he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn't do badly, I made a reasonably good living and enjoyed some success.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I still suffer from stress and work-related stress, but I enjoy training.
I have always enjoyed training, and now that I am doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life".

According to one survey, the perfect time to have a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased consumption in the most struggling British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase during July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA business advisory board responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's longest stay at the World Cup have resulted in a pattern in July similar to that of June, with pubs enjoying a 2.8 per cent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered an even greater penalty.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business volume during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specialising in drinks were the best performers with consumption increases exceeding the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs have also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and consumption of food decreased by three percent".
Paul Newman, an employee of the leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to out-of-home consumption.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a 4.8 percent annual decline will prove especially painful if added to that is the continuous rise in costs.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant business and the weather will be in charge of telling whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breathing space for the sector".
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 operating groups with combined revenues of over £9 billion and is considered the benchmark for the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that are hidden from their parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
This news has caused an increased fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults in the dark.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in the number of "fake Insta" accounts (referring to the photo-sharing social network Instagram).
This news has caused an increase in fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenage girl asking to be "raped".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's director, Mike Buchanan, stated the following: "It is alarming that there are so many teenagers who are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Federation board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described this decision as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are sure Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from her membership of the council", Beattie said.
Doyle stated the following: "I am very much looking forward to being a spokesman for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic gold medals and who currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine whether I would recover and how far I would go.
It was a grueling job, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your encouraging messages".
An ad by a breastfeeding company comparing women to cows divides public opinion on social media
A breast-milk company has divided public opinion on social media with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To announce the launch of the "world's first silent portable breast pump", Elvie released an ironic music video ad to demonstrate the freedom the new breast pump offers mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of cow dung to the tune of a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I'll bite myself, but I don't have a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not goats, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on to say, "Mush, mush, I'm feeding the babies, mush, mush, I'm kissing my friends".
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on social media.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has provoked mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom claimed that it exposes the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, but in their case we stole their babies days after giving birth", one wrote.

Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't they use it to advertise a milk pump for mothers who are left with their babies?"
Another viewer added: "What a tactless announcement".
Other viewers defended the ad, with one woman even stating that she found the song "very funny".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Pulling out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I interpreted it as a joke.
It looks like a great product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad for mothers who are sucking their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they have been dancing with the discrete extractors inserted into their heads.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who are extracting their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can be discreetly fitted into a maternity strap, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even walk around while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges that it entails while demonstrating in a fun and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This isn't the first time Elvie's extractor has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly made their way to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained immigrant children has increased even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to assign sponsors for the children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80 percent of the people who are the godparents or household members of these people are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
For this reason, we will continue to pursue these individuals", Mr. Albence stated.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest instead of the previous 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference rather than in person to try to legalize their case before an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements to receive assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts according to shelter workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers said that such fears are heightened in larger centers like Tornillo, where there is a greater likelihood that a child's symptoms of illness will be overlooked because of their size.
They also added that bringing children to the campsite without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could imply a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be "taken care of in the appropriate manner".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue "fighting this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions were being provided for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would target jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for ensuring the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the body's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are expecting, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidency"
At this time, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, up 1.7 million from four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers on nights when major news events occurred.
"It's like a fire that draws people in because it's about something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? I asked her.
"He said, 'Because you make me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the plot that emerges from Washington may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the state of the world economy.
Disconnection from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it's more than being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin bomber jacket ("a garbage bag of arrogance", claimed the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's shallow descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night", said Brent Montgomery, a senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the character changes and the daily turns of Trump's show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get off the hook as Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all these silly shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss commented to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Foreign money is pouring in to fund House candidates for midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is receiving a big inflow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two incumbents in the race to fill the same seat.
This newly reorganized district on the outskirts of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which is largely overlapping the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans manipulated the electoral districts of the old districts in their favor.
The race in the new 17th congressional district has unleashed a campaign finance festival between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a close victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed a wide following.
That seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits give the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, and then backed down.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners fired the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to order the heads of US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to return "due to recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson in a statement this month.
However, the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid, has only been discussed.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed holding a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to chair the conference, now slated for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to him, diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations as long as the participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak as long as his anonymity was preserved.
Studying the past
The next negative case could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice case, of which there is currently ample evidence in the public record.
Reportedly, Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable by that body, just as he is preparing for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western front stood up and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killing that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is either accelerated or retarded.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the water up to his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording to the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that the information in The Times is not true.
"How are we to respond when the investigation just requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or his nomination to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the glaring allegations of sexual abuse and perjury?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands accountability from Mr. Trump?
If we don't pass those tests, our democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied my home, which was the seat of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw they achieved in Spain against Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favourable position to qualify for group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury has kept midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal are a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game thinking we could do something positive and score a point.
We had a chance to win in the end, but, in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
We were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to get the three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure that we will be able to fight for a positive result.
Last year was tough with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made to the team, but there's a great atmosphere right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget last season and succeed".
Women worry about saving for their retirement
Despite the fact that survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their families about it.
About half of the participants in this Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about the subject.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they're not taking the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance division.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to agree on where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Among the financing options for long-term care are a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider signing a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Make a written plan of the details so that you can be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who are treating him?" asked Martin.
"What medication is he taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan".
A man is shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (UK summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
Her injuries are not serious and police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a number that is expected to continue to rise.
Due to the communications blackout, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from Donggala regency, an area located north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is situated at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of Celebes Island.
The regency, an administrative region less than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal Donggala region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly at Morowali on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have affected the area in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands, located off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the deaths of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck Pidie Jaya regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but over 100 people died due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian resort island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest, according to a memo released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in pretrial custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, therefore" when questioned, the jail reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, with hindering the filing of a domestic violence complaint, and with possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His fiancée accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder she suffers from after serving with the Army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds of people
At least 384 people are reported dead after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are unavailable, and the death toll is expected to rise as the days go by.
The quake occurred just outside of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people, a penalty that hasn't been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, taking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused them serious injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes carry the possibility of the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in association with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said in describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as stated in the notice of intent to prosecute.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York hasn't prosecuted a death penalty case in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he viewed on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
You have pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of criminal mischief.
David Patton, one of the federal crown lawyers tasked with representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea to life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics (as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should take over negotiations with the EU).
Peter Bone, the MP, told the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left the EU by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May of reconciling the divided ranks of her party was made evident as the Remain Tories joined an independent anti-Brexit protest held in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers plan commitments amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to get a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, to force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr Bone said at the Solihull Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been put in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been given the job, we would already be outside the EU,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers' plan".
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated the following: "We do not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
Tory and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also joined the march, telling reporters: "All I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers' plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, he added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said at the rally that it was necessary to make "politicians feel uncomfortable" if they intended to derail the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Currently this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, she added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
We are mobilising the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we have become a proud, independent and self-governing United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists held up banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It is an absolute farce.
The concept of Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will seriously consider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a town hall in a western Massachusetts town.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 campaign co-chair in Massachusetts.
She is the focus of speculation as Trump's successor in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the city council format since Trump took office.
An aide asked if the president was planning to run.
Warren responded that it's time for us women to go to Washington and fix the problems of our government, and for that we need a woman in the presidency.
An arrest has been made in connection with the fatal shooting of LSU player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 a.m. eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win by overtaking Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who started from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone as he defended his position for the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the pack, something that would prove decisive.
Mercedes pitched a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after several wheel-to-wheel manoeuvres that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior at the risk of being left behind after a double defensive manoeuvre in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the starting grid and worked his way up to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of it by keeping his tyres to get faster in the final part and overtaking Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally bounced on lap 44 but was unable to advance any position in the final eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to secure the top two spots, Hamilton said.
A body language that's not very appropriate
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at an event on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate was demonstrating that people were "miserable, disgusting and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see that people are angry and that they are miserable, disgusting and lying", he said.
When you see these posts and leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't go.
I did not go".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you have any leaks?
Remember his response -- did you leak the document? -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, not at all.
I didn't go.
Hold on a second.
Filter it? No. " She added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to keep his confidentiality, and I did as he asked.
But his denial didn't seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the event on Saturday night: "I'm telling you that the body language was not the right one.
I may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life.
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repulsive, they don't care who they harm, who they have to trample to regain power and control, the president said in his second speech.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team lead before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to secure the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to come back to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the previous three wins coming to the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later from Beauvillier's assist after an assist from David Rutherford.
In a hectic early period, Sullivan re-entered the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead on the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard tied the game with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined together to help Nielsen overtake Dundee for the first time in the match late in the second period and secured the win by his side's fifth goal in the half of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed a hero after dying to ensure a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll stands at 800 and many more are missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of Palu City.
Despite his co-workers fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post in the violently rocking control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could be safely taken off.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
"It broke our hearts to hear", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be continuing to rise as there are many bodies under the falls and many of them could not be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves up to six meters high devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is a tragedy already, but it could have been much worse".
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one missing after plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one person is missing after previously claiming all 47 passengers and crew exited the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane flew past the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, commented that he had entered with very little height.
"This is an extremely positive thing", Jaynes commented.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to make their way through waist-high water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were screaming and scared, and that he had suffered a slight head wound.
The United States Navy reported that sailors who were working near the site on dock improvement tasks also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the aircraft sank approximately 30 feet.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in recorded airline accidents in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The U.S. Attorney's Office has returned to the evidence on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The analyst of the United States Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, he described to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of their death.
Rowlett stated that she received location data from several cell phones that proved Tellis had met with Chambers the night of his death contradicting her previous claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When these records showed that his cell phone was found with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for approximately two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"The scum of his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be set for a jury verdict that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and fighting social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hardcore hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City child care worker sues a couple after a "racist" message
A New York City childcare worker is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an unsolicited text message from a mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anguish at the discovery that childcare worker Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a note.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, stating that the caretaker who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job poorly and that she was expecting a Filipina according to the New York Post ad.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for severance pay and demands $350 a day for the six months of in-house work for which she was originally hired even though there was no contract in between.
"Look, I want to show them that these things are not done", he told the Post on Friday, later adding, "It's a case of discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent him a message that I had no intention of sending.
It's not racist.
We are not racists", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was due to a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come with me!"
After comparing the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a two-month-old baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to go after someone like that?
That's not very ethical", added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear as can be concluded in a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it was published.
It's very interesting to know now what we know about Paddington's enormous success".
After stating that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "grim" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and not a pretentious one", he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a son who accomplishes something: you're proud even though you don't really do it.
I think he felt Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave full credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad would call regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And he did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating was slowly being consumed and leaving his body.
He'd been dead for a while and now he was shutting down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she was suffering.
"No one has detected it", he said.
"I had my head down and tears were coming out of my eyes all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this amazing sense of solidarity for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her".
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel the way I have to feel every day", he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any room".
However, he left his job before his death and was "deeply depressed".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he killed himself.
Mrs. Davis commented: "I have a continuing concern that there is a side effect".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to speak".
Mrs Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs Davies' for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything to me about being sad or depressed or anything like that", he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day hit rock bottom (when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything)".
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "He tore the family apart.
He's out of control.
But we have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), we might get some unity", Mr. Flake commented on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "sinking" due to the paralysis of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
With five weeks to go until the midterm elections on November 6, if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush had been calling senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can muster at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is down under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un's rise to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, down from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in fees charged by people responsible for moving people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the widest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South (which technically continue to be at war) have improved markedly during the last few months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of parked nuclear weapons.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in principle to work towards eliminating nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US-imposed sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't trust our national security and, under those circumstances, there is no possibility of us disarming unilaterally first", declared Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and asserted that he was not fit by nature to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved in that way, I would call her a hysteric", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh appeared very emotional, at times almost shouting and talking as he described his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputation assassination" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not access the Supreme Court because it showed that he had prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you're not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court, but the court you're currently in", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions Kavanaugh might take against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to go to court and still expect us to say, look at that good!" asserted Pelosi.
And women need to exercise.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over, and you cannot expel it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, is it?"
She went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she would cry when she was angry, too, but she developed a technique that was that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm mad at you".
And then, he would go on.
It seemed brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, in which I started crying with an unfathomable rage, was an older woman grabbing me by the back of the neck, a distant superior who had always given me a slight fright, and leading me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you by coming to you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bids.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she couldn't consider running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was late, he was late in raising funds, so he vowed that he would not enter the race for president unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only contribute $250 to her.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" she asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and of anger at the existing sexism) that left her speechless.
"You would think she had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
"Did he cry?""
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial bombings of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and although the war is far from over, a detachment between the countries could prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year listing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with the imposition of new tariffs that affect the equivalent of $200 billion, taxing half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has counter-attacked in the same fashion time after time, most recently by raising tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to emulate the US measures, and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will emulate them anytime soon.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be far more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ready to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would appreciate any help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the United States' sixth consecutive defeat on European soil and has gone without winning a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battling player of the tournament, threw the ball to the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has shone in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European player with the most wins in the tournament, with 25.5 points.
"I don't cry very often, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I was able to help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the singles match on Sunday.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that kid play", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 majors, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to stay off the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber round of golf throughout the tournament.
United States captain Jim Furyk stated after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, for a moment, they put the Europeans in a difficult situation.
We fight.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Their 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll get out of the way.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's for the hat.
They were superior".
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the commission, increasingly uneven flowering conditions are being observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km of the coast from the northern counties of Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Concentrations can be found 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Red tide has also been found in Pasco County.
You've been informed of the presence of mid-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, low and high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, low and high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, low and mid-level concentrations in Charlotte County, low and high concentrations on or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation are reported to be continuing.
There's been no reported cases of this type in northwest Florida for the past week.
