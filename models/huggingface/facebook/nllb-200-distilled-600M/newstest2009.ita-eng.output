The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered its losses.
The CEZ shares accounted for almost half of the daily trading volume.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the previous day, which was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the Wall Street stock crash.
We also see a market reaction to the vote in the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
The collapse of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, the shares of the Asian stock exchanges plummeted dramatically, although the indices, however, later that day erased some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index during the day erased almost 4%, but later also a portion of the losses stabilising at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Sydney Stock Exchange stocks were down more than 5%, but eventually the losses were down to 4.3%.
The local index shows that the Thay-Wan Stock Exchange has fallen by 3.6%.
"The planning of the bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world", noted Hong Kong's head of the Securities Office, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, manages its own financial policy, thus not dependent on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
The US legislature, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return to dialogue quickly and approve the financial support proposal.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer consequences.
The US stock market crash
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system support plan, which was to have provided $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Czech crowns).
Lawmakers have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US stocks on Monday experienced a slaughter and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest collapse in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar drop was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the US government can issue $700 billion to the banks.
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of understanding of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be held early next week.
The US legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the bailout plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost 12 trillion crowns).
But it hasn't been said yet.
The congressional representatives, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the bill and voting on it.
The financial support plan will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
The economists believe that the announcement of the financial plan should be the first and most important psychological factor to awaken financial markets.
But then we will have to return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which we can in practice achieve market support.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made a big step forward".
"We have clarified our differences of opinion on how to present the market stabilisation package", said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, to Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislature delegates met Saturday and Sunday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-marketable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses for financial companies and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
"We are in the final agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market".
"We still need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we are there", said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is strikingly affecting the sharply collapsing stock markets.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the market on Monday following a congressional decision.
But for now it's not clear exactly when the two houses of Congress will vote on the bill and whether negotiations can be stopped at the last minute on some issues.
The legislators hope it will be passed in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount of the scheme support shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the remainder of the money if it feels the program is not doing its job, blocking the next $100 billion and the final $350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Even if the President can veto this decision, Congress can override its veto.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has remained, that is, to obtain financing to buy passive mortgage securities, the price of which has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", the Republican senator said.
President. - The next item is the report (Doc.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's positive development and appreciated "the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restrictions on gold parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the financial programme, taxpayer protection from losses, closing the budget for reductions, and splitting the financial plan.
The new law also has to limit the so-called gold parachutes for the managers of companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee to monitor the funds.
These should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step forward towards an agreement that will work and be useful to the market and also to all Americans", said Paulson.
The plan is designed to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government should negotiate new mortgage installments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly installment costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals.
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and government will divide losses among themselves", Marek told iHned.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not so crucial, according to Marek.
"Most importantly, this week the congressional representatives should reach agreement on support for this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time", Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against cell phones
We'll advise you how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
This makes it clear that it is best to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons to get a self-reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
You might not be able to buy an expensive high-quality recording to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these music products do not come out as LP's and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
But if you have hard rock, jazz, or blues vinyl on your shelves, you're probably dreaming of a recording like that.
It also works with portable music, i.e. music compressed or simply in MP3 format.
Here too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the 20-crown marketplace.
Two extremes between which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It's the battery life that matters.
Some high-quality music players are able to do much more than just read music, which mobile phones do not by mistake.
There is no other device as universal today as the mobile phone.
Besides the primary functions, phone calls and texting, it can read music and videos, record both and it has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse, and maybe even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palm trees, you'll also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the sooner the indicator on the screen will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap phones, don't count them as lasting more than a few hours.
If you add in, from time to time, a few calls, get yourself another battery charger at work for safety, that goes for the most expensive appliances.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least nine hours on continuous function with a charge.
Another problem exists when you download music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players can do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used on mobile phones.
Readers, with a few exceptions (iPods) do not need any special software.
Just fill the machine with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create a multimedia library by themselves, sorted by the performers' names, album name, genre or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you should be particularly concerned with the battery's strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, clearly, ease of use.
If you need music primarily in the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you'll need just any cell phone that reads MP3.
This is now possible, clearly, on any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what formats your cell phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support all of them, and the majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format, which is among the most widely used, the majority of devices support music in WMA format.
Less is found in the AAC (formatting used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
You just have to visit the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a cell phone reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is usually limited to the radio moment.
The prices aren't very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either via GSM, the internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones with them.
Anyone who wants to hear something is stuck in their pocket while the MP3 player is left behind at home.
But it also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least the wireless earpiece.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small portion of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-reader devices is, for many, the price.
The cheaper ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones, and even the 3.5 mm headphone jack, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The advantage of readers is, among other things, easy handling.
The simplest ones, not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice), are really something anyone can handle.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling at one time to the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally stalling the launch of the mobile internet and consequently a giant data bill.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Also for the purchase of the respective card, you are in the 2 000 krone.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the more expensive ones can do it with 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you prefer to use specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of service so you get closer to the same MP3 player.
In this area Sony Ericsson has made more progress, with the walkman line having the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide the same service and price range up to 4 000 kr, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, generally up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe .
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, something is missing here  a virtual operator that forces traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe has been mentioned many times on Mobil.cz.
Finally, this was confirmed by the Czech Republic, which noted that the price of SMS is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regularizing roaming charges may lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
It may sound absurd, but we also have three mobile networks and coverage that is highly above 100%.
The mobile telephony operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ) head Pavel Dvořák has also often stressed this point, saying in the past that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer has many possibilities (otherwise it might be difficult to find other frequencies).
But there's another possibility - the virtual operator.
The very entry of virtual operators into the market has led to a significant price decrease, which should have been the reaction of traditional operators.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices were heard in Britain as we do.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such workers and that they can be truly successful.
We must not go too far in the end for examples.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the mobile operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic is owned by U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a much more concrete task force.
In order to be able to function effectively, it needs far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not involve relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators usually come in at low cost, offering low-cost calls and SMS, which is often in line with the more restrictive service offerings.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS services that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even betting on a not-so-distant group of money can be a pretty good move.
This operator is pointing, so to speak, specifically at men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operators they like and can trust", says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also affirm a concept similar to that in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators rely.
Moreover, from a service point of view it is relatively saturated.'
In the Czech Republic, no possibility, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there ever is an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk of expanding this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations have little to look forward to.
Mobilking will be switched on in other countries in our area", Jana Studničková, press spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, told Mobile.cz in a telephone conversation.
He thus confirmed indirectly that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favourable to this view.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitors from being created.
For some time now, it has been keen to launch a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a strong interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner you do, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them", says group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information suggests that we may have the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, an impenetrable wall of silence stands around his creation.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no one with a complex and serious project has come to us", Vlastimil Sršeň of Telefónica O2's press section told Mobil.cz in his statement.
The specificity of the Czech market is also the subject of other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2 statement: "So far we have not seen any business project that is vital and beneficial to both of us, on which to build on".
He adds: "There will hardly be a virtual operator on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
We should have had a concrete agreement at this stage before the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.'
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common high-speed mobile internet network.'
Competent authorities - with the accompanying operators
The attitude of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The troubles surrounding the creation of the U:fon show that when operators are interested in something they can row from the same side.
Perhaps the pressure was on ČTÚ at the time of the creation of U:fon towards T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from ČTÚ's webpages.
But now U:fon is just an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has been only recently strengthened, especially with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
As regards the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and above all on his services.'
The attitude of mobile operators is, however, surprisingly uninteresting in the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only the attitude of the CTU that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - it has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
The Commission has also proposed a new proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
This, however, took its typical position in the face of the whole problem.
'The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure lease agreement between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the potential buyers' offer has probably not been attractive enough for traditional operators", said Kristián Chalupa, from the ÚOHS External Relations Section, in response to our question.
This statement by the operators' representatives may not come as a surprise.
But the office, which must defend the interests of consumers and ensure that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the overseas countries where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services".
But of course pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and price reductions are not in the interests of the OHIM.
What is truly shocking about the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three actors resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is a matter of opinion.
The same price for petrol for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competition.
'The Section has found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position and therefore has no correspondingly greater responsibility for its market behaviour.
The telecommunications regulator may also lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile network market for virtual operators,' Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points .
There is of course the relevant market analysis carried out by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are the only market in terms of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has - logically - the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion, it has to be dominant.
But even if we do not admit this argument, it should be a little alarming for the UOHS that three mobile operators are doing so strangely similarly.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all operators.
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not promoted until the recent Telecommunications Act was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
This is something that the representatives of the UOHS must know better than they do, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
You can do it when no one's looking
We are not aware of the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which are even present in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established persons.
The magic is that the company is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, he then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
'If the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, arise, it could be a breach of contractual conditions and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company,' Martina Kemrová replied to the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers can be involved.
No operator is defending himself against such an attitude at the same time.
The fact that these companies are not indifferent to their business is that they make a profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, and therefore cannot have it in full as regular customers of mobile operators.
But that's exactly what should be a little strange to the CTU.
In addition, another question arises for the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to this attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It must be added that the OHIM has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and whose business conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, in almost all countries where operators were born, traditional operators were trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were pretty much identical - too small a market, too saturated a limit, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries, regulators have intervened in these very cases, not to defend mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with informal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and others came to him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves off each other like a hot potato.
We cannot, in our experience, get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in these cases makes them more than comfortable.
But we're not throwing the sponge.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will appear to us very soon, the Czech mobile market will start again.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it is unlikely that ÚOHS would remain impassible to the rejection (discrimination) of the other operators concerned.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one.
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj" in a solemn way on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State.
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available  solo with male or female vocals, choral pass and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful.
He has already told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he has chosen singing solo variants, singers with younger voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to make sure that both and the choir have clear pronunciation, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony", he reported.
Then the national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in Josef Kajetán Tyl's original work Fidlovačka accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It's gained popularity and people have spontaneously made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The Prague MHD will accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, tram and buses with an electronic card in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
Right now , about 100,000 people who have their own Opencard can get it .
Passengers can purchase the 30-day and 90-day annual card (starting on 1 January 2009) and at the same time charge their card at the Infopoints and the Transport Company offices and at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The vouchers can be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers benefited from the service before noon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the railway stations where they used to line up for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased online and recharged on the Opencard at one of the 12 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a trained staff gateway that will help them make their online purchases and will also record their credit card", said Martin Opatrný, project spokesman.
In addition to the library, it will be possible to upload the electronic vouchers to the Opencard ATMs and self-service machines that are installed at the subway entrances.
What are these ATMs like?
They are red, resemble ticket wipers and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stops.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný concluded.
The cutting will be controlled by the driver instead of the ATM.
The ATM service that will be running from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after you pay the cutting, it will load on top.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the urban train and bus lines from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the train systems added to Prague integrated transport there are card reader controllers which check the timing and zonal validity", explained the method of checking tickets Filip by the organisation Ropid, which sets the timetables for public transport in Prague.
The buses have card readers integrated into the driver's case.
During the climb, it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the specified point next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded logs.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the charged cards, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information", Drápal added.
Passengers who take city buses and do not remember, when the card expires, can go back to the self-service ATMs, where they load the cards onto paper.
Here you will see the validity information of your documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is shown in the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, some Sudeten German groups reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is primarily the result of the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemian Science Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask the US President in their letter not to allow the return of the "Sumava district" occupied by Hitler under the Munich Agreement to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter, signed with the words "People who care about the fate of Šumava with all their heart", reads.
Since, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia  knowing the Czech national character - gives Sudeten Germans hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to assume the protectorate over Šumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without respect for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed in no way, in no way, to the victory of the Allies", it says in the letter.
The authors cannot sign it because they are afraid of the "Czech oppressors"' thirst for revenge.
If the president of the United States were to doubt the beliefs of the Germans in Šumava, he would simply organise a referendum in the district on whether his people want to become part of the United States or live under the dominion of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive to our knowledge of postwar history, some witnesses say it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least realize that this would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German Budějovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in the prison camp at Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans visited him so that he could teach them Czech.
"These people thought that once they got home the Czech would be comfortable", said Chalupa.
He said that none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war had any hope of being deported from the Republic on the basis of Beneš's decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This is also the name of the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will be shown on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol.
And also remind him to put his seat belt on before he leaves.
It is aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What's going to be in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood, there's the word "you'll pay".
This must symbolize that a person can pay with his life in a moment of distraction.
The ads will scare the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has taken inspiration from similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of dramatic accident victims are commonly seen.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is when they go by red, for example, and they save time.
The staff is the danger of a fine or an accident.
The risk must be reminded of to drivers", says the Ministry of Transport psychologist Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce hospital.
And that's why we need press coverage, and especially negative publicity, the psychologist believes.
He says that warning signs are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it", warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The Prime Minister of the Israeli Provisional Government Ehud Olmert has expressed his support for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
That's what he said in the dialogue he published Monday in the Jediot Achronot newspaper.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) areas, if not all, will have to be returned", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the same percentage (of Israeli areas) to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want to be attacked by scammers or spies, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, in which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic sites", which are located within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,' he added.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Mr Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believed was the necessary condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They must renounce their current relationship with Iran; they must renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must renounce their permanent support for Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus stewards illegal?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on a bus that makes long-distance trips
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency bus, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the traffic law", says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week's accident that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure seat of the bus at the time, although there were two other seats still allocated.
But the bus can crash or brake abruptly even when it is distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus has standing seats or not according to the traffic book.
If it is not approved, passengers must sit.
The buses of the Student Agency are not standing, the company's director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálnĕ.cz.
"We have assessed this with the Ministry and initially it did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
It was later revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned seat", he expressed his view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role  no law deals with the regularization of this role".
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law only recognises the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined,' adds spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic at the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is quite clear on this issue.
Depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
All right, here", he says.
It categorizes buses into urban ones where there are standing places and maximum speed limits, interurban ones with standing places with maximum speed and long-distance ones without standing places with maximum speed and seatbelts with seat belts.
It's like flying, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers during a quiet run, the situation can be compared to airplane service.
It's not safe there either when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can shake his head".
"If the bus brakes abruptly, the laws of physics are obviously valid.
Just like the city bus or the tram.
The carrier must resolve the safety of stewards with a regulation", he says and also understands that, from a legal point of view, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that provides steward services.
This one employs about two hundred.
The director does not consider their job dangerous even after the accident.
"As soon as I feel compelled to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce expenses", he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, justified the absence of stewards on its means as an interest in safety.
"We don't have a hostess, we've been fighting it all along.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
A great tragedy has happened.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the bus's road.
The bus driver tried to avoid him with a sharp maneuver, but he hit him with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were occupied.
"You can't reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they're flammable".
The firm plans to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court's ruling to pay damages to the girl's family, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The law review?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, which has been working on by a team of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport for more than a year, could lead to a more precise definition of the movement of stewards on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results.
They are not considered as such by buses, they are more concerned with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and cell phone use while driving", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewards' activities to be a major threat to passenger safety", concludes spokesman Havelka, adding that bus safety control is the responsibility of the police and the security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf are on Frankfurt
The words of the WestLB director's letter to the staff of the house are not missing.
In the letter published on Monday that it could form 'the centre of the capital market of the savings fund financial group' through the meeting of units of the Düsseldorf banking institution with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank.
West LB would launch a 'competent block' with lasting profits in such a venture.
In addition, such a union could be a decisive impetus for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
That's what it says when a board of directors wants to demonstrate their capacity for action in difficult times.
Because the affliction of WestLB is still under great pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, which has long ago warned the North Rhine-Westphalia regional government that time is running out to find a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Banks already know about because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been discussed for quite some time, including by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, reported at the time of the presentation of the first half of the year's turnover that a merger of the house on Via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB made no sense.
However, the Deka board of directors, which is half led by regional banks and savings fund consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct joint venture talks with West LB.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the talks, as they say in the business square, have just begun.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important business centres in Frankfurt, and this is not the first time it has been mentioned when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003, for a short period, it appeared that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this three-man association.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Hassia opposed Helaba's participation.
The other two institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought of merging Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, Helaba's chairman of the board, spoke out against design games to reunite with his house.
I would like to say that the Commission has already made a number of proposals.
The elections to the Bavarian Parliament have passed, so a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank and the Baden-Württemberg Bank may take place first.
For Helaba, this is not good news at all.
If the pressure increases for more mergers, the partners will soon be gone.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of savings banks Assia-Turingia, which shares 85% of Helaba, has set the stage for the meeting with WestLB.
It would be only NordLB.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just a count.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June Merl noted that the decisive question on the business model for securing the future of regional banks had not yet been answered by the German savings banks association.
The West LB division may also come out in the end, which is not desirable on the part of the West LB.
The letter from the Board of Directors thus expresses the desire to aspire to a 'general solution' in any event.
We shall see how the merger of the individual parties with Deka-Bank works.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena, it's the first time, while for Luke, it's the third or fourth.
This time Elena is at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser 5-liter barrel, stands a massive beard and shows about 200 travelers what deep tones it can produce from its throat.
Elena gives Luca a slap first and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart this evening at 23.45 with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra", arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another only Brazilian travellers.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing the flag in their hands, having already celebrated at night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not something for Italians.
Mark wears a long coat with a fake fur coat and a pair of silver-plated glasses.
They've been at Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year.
Night trip, day party, return at 10:30.
"Sleeping at night would only create useless expenses", says Marco.
The cost of 45 euros includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian standards of genuineness, the sickness fund and the German guide.
And so at night the buses leave for Brennero.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the bus is silent, the passengers are sleeping.
Better yet, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian-marked buses on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6.30 a.m., as planned, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
One, put on the yellow hat.
On the left side of the book is "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When they open the doors of the beer tendon it means running!"
"Run!" Run and take the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not in front, or we'll block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the active space!"
The bottle costs 8.25 euros, Marco shouts.
And don't forget to tip the guy.
"To show the security service that we're good!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10.30 p.m. we meet again here, okay?"
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street, one follows yellow caps to trees, street signs, and even a billboard of a major Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the festival, known as "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures, it is said that 50,000 people are leaving to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced with 7 High Adige officers, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes statistics on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical care ahead of the British (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially beloved by Italians is the Hofbräuhaus.
Notti insonni per i creditori del Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word 'relative' and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from the critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
The DAX-listed real estate lender Hypo Real Estate gets a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turmoil.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part requested.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
The bottom line is the losses of the DePfa affiliate.
The State financier, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced itself in the short term  which is no longer possible because of market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million, and its share of equity had also fallen from 1,6 to 1,45.
Current income and net income from financial activities fell to zero compared with last year, and earnings from increases in demand and certain actions and the settlement of credit provisions fell by more than 70% on the 5 million euro.
Only thanks to higher income from the repayment of subordinated compensation costs resulting from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the repayment of interest under the single text of the tax laws and the management of business by business associations, the negative profit was quite moderate at around 16%.
The former public financier, after being privatized in 1990, was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were scrapped in Aareal Bank.
Since the income from traditional state financing was too low, the Depfa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects by private and public investors (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now depreciate the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007 they had already been reduced by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important state and infrastructure financier.
It is more dependent on refinancing in the market among banks than other institutions because it has no client deposits.
The collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago has largely drained the lending of banks, because banks are accumulating liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs some 50 billion short-term refinancing funds for a part of the Defa's credit portfolio.
Hypo Real Estate claims that the group's financial needs were covered by the credit for a period of time and that the company was protected from the influx of the mostly non-functioning international money markets.
Other sources say that the money will ensure refinancing until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Steering Committee, Georg Funke, said that the HRE Group would not need money markets anytime soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) rely on the fact that the HRE Group's marketable position is still ensured.
This is what we hope for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and immensity of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After the bank learned that it was about to fail on Sunday night, the momentary bailout failed to calm the spirits.
The share price fell by 75% to EUR 3.30.
They're pretty good at mortgage rates.
While the debt of the previous grade is almost immovable, the rates of deferred loans are falling.
The loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate are mainly affected, including those due after 2009.
The HRE loans were once considered as an alternative investment for speculation, but now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, as the crisis in the banks and the institution itself has intensified and the Depha has been responsible for the crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, you can expect to depreciate your annuities within the deadline.
Or it comes into play, which nobody dares hope  that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But as for the information that has been turned upside down by partial stateizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will create a sleepless night for long-term investors, especially, with the decision to break their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop, on her first day of school, is supposed to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: "German is completely "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana knows the word since Mangas- in the new Japan Story Exchange Log.
The First Day of School in Japan
I was so excited.
I was having a hard time going to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way by myself, and fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first lesson does not seem to have been fixed as we have in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 a.m. until a brief interview with the professor begins at 8:40 a.m., the so-called "home room".
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, and I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have my school uniform, I put on an old hostess skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
I sat down in front of the chair, dressed like this, and tried to pronounce it right. "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and I'm celebrating my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, laughed and made a sign, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew this one from my Mangas.
It's in the Japanese girl's survival vocabulary and it means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my seat.
The girl next to me thought, "It was an honor to sit next to a student exchange".
The rest of the class was quietly continued, but when the gong sounded, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking and laughing and asking me questions. Then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break everyone opened their Bento.
My hostess also made me the lunch basket-- it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some kind of meat and tofu rolls.
I don't even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums in salt, brrr!
Bento's not just lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a homemade Bento, prepared quite artistically, in the hope of meeting the boy during recreation.
I read it in my manga.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I would like to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
"Why I'm fascinated"
I've been reading the Mangas for years now.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning a little Japanese.
I was completely convinced I'd come once.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They keep us here a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life".
Anche i ratti hanno dei sentimenti
A rat or cockroach flee when they feel danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals too have feelings.
Ma come si potrebbe verificare se, quando si comportano nel nostro stesso modo, hanno le nostre stesse sensazioni?
For some years now, the Internet magazine Edge has been publishing articles by well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in una serie presenta risposte scelte alla domanda: "Che cosa crede che sia vero, senza poterlo provare?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, but I or anyone else has yet to prove it, since we cannot prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, we should at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
Appena ci rivolgiamo alle altre specie e poniamo domande sul sentimento o in generale sulla coscienza, entriamo in un territorio impraticabile, perché la base di riferimento non combacia.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do, which is, it pretends to be dead, runs away, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, which is why some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I can't believe this.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to communicate our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked to human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In humans this large area is much more developed than in other primates and seems to be completely missing from other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our prefrontal cortex-dependent consciousness, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the basis for the assumption that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature should be seen in the way man speaks: Since much of life is connected to language, it is often said to be connected to conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness is not dependent on language, it would affect it so that the animal's consciousness, as it is made, is certainly very different from the circumstances of our consciousness.
So it's hard to figure out how the conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it can't be measured as an internal and subjective thing, analyzed through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will put us in big trouble.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
You could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies of primate short memory, particularly in the example of visualization.
So this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, goes first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What, then, is the definition of feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
So what we refer to as "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like the body's reactions) occupies the working memory.
Thus, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and especially humans.
With the speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In this respect Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activity of the sensory regions of the cortex and cerebral palsy, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless focused more on the cerebral palsy.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, this could definitely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
I cannot, purely theoretically, dispute this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear to rats and humans is likely to be felt by the senses in both cases: but how could it be, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach in danger runs away like he's afraid?
In my view, the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital resemblance.
And that's the neural comparison that continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephals, cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the paleoencephallic brain responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than rat emotional sensations.
However, there are advances at the neural level here, provided that the same procedure is abandoned on rats and humans.
Just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't research their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered nearsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually bump into a wall.
I'm a practical emotional person, by the way.
UEFA President Platini: forwarding to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland", said Wasjunik.
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries".
Both host countries are busy with the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the maximum speed", said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"We will be constantly monitored by UEFA"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish association PZPN was suspended from the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a serious danger that PZPN would not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer".
Many members of the first division were convicted of manipulation only last season, and the start of the League was eventually postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid repeats indignantly
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about the private life in interviews, and now she's having a crush on her ex-boyfriend: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her ex-boyfriend Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He foams with anger and recoils.
War of the Roses is delayed for ex-spouses Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now have a nasty fight with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed her reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful".
The extent of the betrayal she would only know after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul stripper" was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women".
Dennis Quaid's reaction to her publicly declared adulterous husband was a clear blow: it would be "unheard of", the 54-year-old told the "New York Daily News", saying "Meg is repeating and reworking the story of our relationship once again".
It would also be "deplorable" for Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, again to "be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion that separation means for every child".
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and soon to be a father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airline and hotel tickets fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel accommodations have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter, it observed a marked decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, overnight stays in many places have already fallen.
From January to March prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined rose by an average of around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar quotation as the reason for this, which would lead to a "slow desire to travel among American tourists".
The recession in hotel prices would also affect financial centres such as Frankfurt and London more strongly than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3%, even holding the record in Europe
The trend in the first quarter also increased as regards flight prices:
Due to the rise in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, and long-haul fuel-intensive flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of Economy Class air tickets fell on average by 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and in the Business, the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9%, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for domestic flights in Germany, the study shows prices have even halved.
The reason for the price drop would be, on the one hand, downward economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has fallen.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, would put increased competition pressure.
The Commission has also taken a number of measures to ensure that the airlines are able to meet the requirements of the common market.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a simple goal and methods the SV Hamburg becomes a capitalist.
At Borussia Luhukay, he still can't find a working group of 11.
Kristoffer Klein is making a bad luck landing for national player Marko Marin .
The Gladbach player came in late first and failed with a shot on the cross.
His message was worded precisely, passed on to his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal", said Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist at HSV for almost three decades, enjoying an even higher estimate than some older players.
And so his warning was heard in the higher realms.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of head coach Martin Jol of Hamburg.
His order must have played like this: Here's the second goal!
The change of position has not taken place.
"Not everything here was beautiful to see today", admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted to relax more".
For the 1-0 Hamburgers must thank Mladen Petric for his head shot (11) and the fact that Gladbach's many weak players could not hurt Hamburg's weak players.
"It was a dirty victory", Martin Jol summed up.
The SV in Hamburg will be 121 this Monday.
The spectators had already celebrated themselves earlier, Saturday afternoon, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing rating on the video screen, which legitimized their sports company as the first in class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can fix everything", said Marcell Jansen.
He feels that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late  the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the gate Petric as well as Jansen blown at FC Bayern  slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more dribbling", Jol sings out forcefully.
After the defeat of the vote
Wall Street is full of fear.
Early reports of the bailout's failure temporarily brought down the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest one-day point loss in its history.
Later Down recovered a little.
At about 8:30 p.m. the world's largest stock market barometer listed a good 5% short of 10,579 paying people.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was flat with a deficit of more than 7% out of 1,548 points
The biggest loser at the time was Dow American Express, which paid us just 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could do it .
The shares of Goldman Sachs have fallen by just 10%.
Just a few days before, the great investor Warren Buffett had joined the firm.
The rescue plan required financial resources to secure the so-called mortgage documents.
The amount must be paid, however, not in one shot, but in degrees.
The State had to maintain the shares of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate rate of quotation, to reduce the debt to the State treasury.
The trend of action in Europe and the USA in the downturn
The billions of dollars of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not remove investor doubts.
The stock price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling sharply and the German stock market index is falling sharply.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is back despite the planned financial market bailout by the state.
The dramatic loss of the course of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank has dragged the German stock market index into deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender have temporarily lost three quarters of their value despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, the Commercial Bank has lost more than 20%.
The German DAX stock market index has slipped well below the psychologically important 6000 points and is listed with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
The world stock market is falling to its knees.
Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first business hour, or 3.3 percent out of 10,809.25 points.
The House of Representatives voted to approve the rescue plan, and the Senate voted on October 1.
The other European exchanges have also been able to move in one direction: the FTSE index has fallen by 3.2 per cent in London so far, the CAC 40 index in Paris has fallen by 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark index after initial profits fell by 1.26% from 11.743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index has slipped 2.1 percent from 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex stock index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed with 12,595.75 paying.
In the MDax, Arcandor's shares are divested after the capital increase was announced.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed new shares for 23 million .
The business and tourism group also stated that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been creating confusion among scientists: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, she now suffers from freezing death.
Scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon for years.
Swing-by is a spacecraft flight maneuver in which they gain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical record as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised scientists for years now is that rockets do not behave exactly as one would expect under the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
Physicists have so far been unable to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong before, and he tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter that could be even very close to Earth", he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
Evidently, an attractive force emerges from it, the effect of which on other celestial bodies is evident.
It is, however, completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter accounts for at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
The abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt will be free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros in ransom.
In a shoot-out before the release, six kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The redemption negotiations are already underway.
The Germans are always the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are examining their health status", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions were reportedly safe and healthy, state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear, so the kidnappers, after being told by an Egyptian public security officer, would have been ready for the abduction to be completed before the Sudanese army killed six of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the official said.
It would have been "only a matter of taking hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the Sudan, Chad and Egypt border area fired at six of the kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany, the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The German newspaper El Masri El Jom reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostage women after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been held until the kidnappers had a safe way out.
The German Embassy in Cairo has refused to take a position on the report .
Abuse by the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led to a woman committing suicide, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of sexual assault.
The Crown Court of Truro learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court learned that Ms. Randle had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a little girl living in Coventry, Trerise molested and bended her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent much of her time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a great surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "gotten to live".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She's believed to have strangled herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended with "I bound her and bandaged her".
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrifying to your victim, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more difficult is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up in court".
I notice the effects Stephanie's parents describe having had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly probable that she had been a promising and happy young successful woman".
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was on the move from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the Waterloo train.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there's nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They'd think this was being handled internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents that were lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies are taking care of B&B's account
British construction companies could face a bill of over £80,000 after the Bradford & Bingley bank bailout.
The government has given £14bn to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was "irritating" that companies and their members had to pay.
The £14bn loan will be eventually paid off when the Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have been prudent are now being called upon to pay part of the bill to those institutions that have been much less prudent.
I'm not sure.
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits they had, and that the companies between them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions which have behaved prudently in the recovering housing market are now being called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions which have been much less prudent".
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options are available to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account", added Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5 pence a liter
People in Jersey are dealing with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be a wholesale price increase for its milk for an extra five pence per liter from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether to dump the price increase on their customers.
Before the February increase, wholesale prices changed for the last time in 2002.
Refusal of bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament
This case is one of the many corruption charges we have against you.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the coming weeks but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the military-backed provisional government of the country give him full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on parole, it is unclear on terms of her release whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he'll appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The high court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application stating that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on word for medical care", says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the High Court's order".
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government allied with the military took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan polio campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to violence linked to the Taliban, says the UN.
The UN has been running a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this is happening despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses the legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in the rival ITV.
BSkyB was ordered by the competition court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously argued that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the US Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special Public Defender to review the firing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Justice Department criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Series allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or proven", said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the fired lawyers had not been rated worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the firing was politically motivated.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in legal action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for the firings, and he eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he was primarily responsible for the firings, that he had abdicated his role as leader and had been exceptionally detached during the trial.
Other officials, including former senior Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf Era will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be withdrawing his special gold award at a ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to earn the recognition.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the 1977 hit album Meat Loaf.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of them".
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocalism that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for almost nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an operation for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel his concerts.
It turned out later that he had a casket on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, some merely for use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street without making Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy road.
There are no traffic signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal Atlantis.
The road must have fans, though.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
We want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the old gentry district.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping him.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the County Board, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay agency outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the District Director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left for city ownership, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place", he said.
"There may be proposals to fix and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it would reopen the small road and install seating, including some for a café that the real estate company hopes to lease the space to.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was first made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity", he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Housing Preservation spokesman, said it was the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical mark.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The terrain was beautiful", said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was filled with garbage, clothing and pieces of buckets, posters, leaves, ropes".
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the piece of public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity  a fragment of almost unchanged city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Slightly Nostalgic Look at the Ending City"), published part of a Town History Address that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, doorless alleyway, dark even during the day, and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and Saracen-style windows, with weeks-old newspapers hovering along the basements".
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat was running swiftly through the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
There were graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer lying next to a bunch of fresh, abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggested it needed to be a little bit more embellished.
Mr Fields, for his part, said he thinks some people even underestimate the attractiveness of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places".
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Review, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow at California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School".
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's education projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", which is true.
To address these shortcomings in achieving goals, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in classrooms in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students at the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are recent arrivals, are studying English.
But among the fourth graders, a staggering 100 percent of students passed the top-level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally astonishing 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on the art of the English language.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of skills and an "no excuses" attitude.
And this is also where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, that the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion".
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico, and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not have been able to identify who he was".
"It works", he observed, "it works for us".
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools with English students?
The school's results make the answer to that question very easy, but the education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent Mr. Obama's answer from being predicted.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the point trivial when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure your children can speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or downplay them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the American financial market bailout plan might not lift the economy.
Oil futures dropped 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Stock Exchange in the morning.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plunged to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety hit investors again Monday even after congressional leaders said they reached an agreement over the weekend on the biggest bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final phase of the phased merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the hectic weekend's negotiations had led to a bailout deal "seems to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equities, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption declines due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The second quarter's performance is a team record.
After spending more time in the Jets uniform than anyone else in the last eight or more seasons, defensive back Shaun Ellis thought he saw it all.
Then he watched the second quarter play on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a rematch.
"Never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the threatening clouds that overwhelmed them with a feeble game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left in the first half.
"I have not gone out of my way", said Favre of all the passes that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think".
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith has planned another crossing and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens is putting a fumble to Warner.
The last turnover, the forced fumble by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal, for a 34-0 lead.
That's more than the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the craziness of it, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both of them -- the Jets gave up 21 unanswered points in the third quarter -- Mangini said, "I can tell you I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third".
There were a lot of spots in a short span of time".
Gebrselassie rested to surpass his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again why many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a favourably flat race win in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for a career so amazing that it produced a world championship or world record for every distance from the mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would make her asthma problems worse.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-time runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have gone the long distance, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from the Brazilian coast won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest has left him cool, not rusty.
"I am so happy", Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had my doubts today, but in the end everything went well".
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, counting on the sprinter as if it were a mid-table race, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish Gebrselassie's greatness as a marathon runner.
With the four Kenyan passing on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, were competing in Gebrselassie after the riders vanished.
Just over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final jump to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but recovered to win in Berlin, making her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing her math right, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners go off with a big detachment, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and trials of a black life
Hidden in the theme park stretching out over the Orlando suburbs, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the gigantic, quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black incorporated town in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools, and no prison".
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city you described -- and that makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project -- remains a place in its own right.
It's as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with white men, who "knowing so little about us, don't know what they're missing".
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was invited to give an opening speech on race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told", said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It must be right".
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It's both a historic pattern of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example of the oak shadow of the rural culture of the black people of the South - sometimes despised, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida into a scene of black history and human drama.
Low as a crutch in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then deviated to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left", he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could only read and write".
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and whatever fits the passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly, this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora was telling it like it was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalized quoting men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it".
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family's move to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston was driving into the city, he would usually arrive without warning in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of decent clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others were submissive.
"People were always very happy to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
But, she added, rolling over in her chair in the backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaque-less grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremonies, and no big conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980's.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the city's western boundary.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff at people sitting on one side", says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a cucumber out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston petitioned the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school board "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite some positive aspects, is diluting Eatonville's cohesion and jeopardizing the confidence of its youth.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening", said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural divide there", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and made room for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - a black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like, "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I really don't understand".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookshelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came as his most famous daughter had reworked the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a lifeguard.
The community began planning a festival in 1988 dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans attended the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the memorial.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five lanes of the revived highway, brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city", Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd put it simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's image of itself.
Those from out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, started appearing in large numbers, and residents started reevaluating the past.
Eatonville was added to the public register in 1998.
A new one-story bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a re-floored and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1800s.
(He's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for Eatonville's history, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A prior request for permission is required for most interviews, and some things -- like murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields -- are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat, bright red teacher, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet as the Hurston Festival expanded, a high level of civic pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, troubled and everything, no better, no worse and proud, creative, hardworking, dumb and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It's a sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned how to describe Eatonville properly.
"Many people, if they've just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's a really nice city".
Here in New York we all talk about finance fluently.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they wouldn't notice they're in the eye of the storm.
They would never have guessed that glass offices, beehives above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City are having their worst "bad day at the office" every day since the 1929 crash.
Farmers are shaking metal carts for tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretched shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees still line up for their morning bagels at food carts on the sidewalks, and it's still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a workday.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the thing so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's door to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service door, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of the people in front of me, who I would have learned from Starr, my "trusted banker", were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places where they commute, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrift (somewhat like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, was placed under control, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and the commissioners who were standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
The average New Yorker has become financially competent in recent weeks.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its fatigued CEO Dick Fuld in familiar terms, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed doorkeeper, almost 50 years old from my condo, has changed the subject from our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my delivery.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left-wing right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry signs like those on the street representing mosques with a red line running through the middle.
The police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties won a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the extremist motives driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if the incident is connected to the election in any way.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred near the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria has meanwhile embarked on a spiritual search journey following its right-wing turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with a strong anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, suggesting that they are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicate that change was being brought to the fore by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
I'm off the road for Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities who were monitoring him that he wanted to go to Spain by crossing France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent Police last Thursday after they provided evidence to the magistrates of Glitter's previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford Prosecutor's Court hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Precinct, Kent Police filed a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days' notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities can lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible moves around the country.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have the right comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent Police and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any potential risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't let him pass the passport check and he ended up flying to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in, and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the praetorium of Uxbridge, west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him in the sex offender registry.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source at the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character".
No heels or flyers or old clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they don't have to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatrical nature of some shots with singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, which is growing every day", explains the artist and makes it clear that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but by seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these great men, you don't have to portray them on stage.
Because their personality and character are inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco players with my camera".
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remind of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day".
Not the dance, the singing or the playing itself, but the artist's personality, his character, capable of capturing the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, is and has been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited during the exhibition.
Passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject".
Although the concept is different in "Flamenco-People", the photographer admits, "I love to portray people, to get to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or a short moment.
I think portraiture is the hardest kind of photography.
You meet or face people, characters you sometimes don't even know or who give you just a few minutes to take a picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas concrete".
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled "Flamenco-people", is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "lucky" one
It is set in places he doesn't know yet and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is grappling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
The writer, who has always been a favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is working on today "is a coincidence" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it".
"If I had good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible", he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants  an early edition of Dickens' book "Our mutual friend", filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, recalled how he was born the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "the pleasure of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous reworking; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more anticonformist".
Time is holding the Pozoblanco Festival back, depriving it of races
The celebration of the races that were supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bulldozers selected for the races had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has been heightened against this festival preventing us from celebrating two out of every three days.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bull run.
The billboard featured Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion, Daniel Luque triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after bullfighting with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the audience than by the race itself.
The worst of them all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned the whistles of much of the audience.
A van with 2,000 pounds of hashish crosses the checkpoint in Alava.
Five minus ten in the morning.
Officers alert the two occupants of a van to the highway and instead of stopping, they flee.
Officers briefed the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping, fled.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After chasing them, the agents managed to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement from the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and falsifying public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were conducting a transport check on the N-1, where it crosses the Armiñón municipal district.
They were stopping a van for inspection when the driver, in violation of the orders, accelerated sharply and passed the checkpoint.
Officers pursued the vehicle until after a few miles, it stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
Ertsaintza agents were able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note of an inspection of the truck, an Iveco Daily.
The hash panes, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight analysis.
Furthermore, since officials determined that the registration number had been 'duplicated' as it did not match the one in the documentation of the van, the arrested person was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing its investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Detainee A.A.J., 28, was taken to the police station to conduct the appropriate proceedings and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing risky maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a California highway spokesman who told People magazine.
The witness specified that at about 4:30 p.m., the Locklear "was crushing the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden back and forth maneuvers.
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
This person alerted the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked confused", and that's why the agents took her to a drug and alcohol specialist center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress proved to be cooperative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol was dismissed from the beginning, although "as observed by officials at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked into the local jail around 7 p.m. to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a rehabilitation clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to take responsibility for the Silva case
The coordinator general of the UI and a member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to decide on the case of former Youth and Sports Advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following accusations of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take its own responsibilities", Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has so far been an adviser in the Council of Civilians.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva would have committed.
He also stressed that training is governed by "very strict codes of ethics for all public functions".
"Blood of May", the epic Garci bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, over two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in theaters, to become a four-hour television miniseries on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and he believes he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of 2 May medrilegno.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the scenarios and costumes appropriate to portray a "stunned Spain that mistook the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence led to a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII", Garci noted.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to Alatriste's or Los fantasmas de Goya's - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes predicted by the set design that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator for almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, staging with actors, with whom he often uses to try before filming with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating", considering that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers, some of whom are in the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known".
Garci doesn't expect any awards from this movie.
"You think you're working for the afterlife at first, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you just want to make one more movie", says Garci after more than 30 years of acting.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sicilian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sicilian dancer pays tribute to another dancer from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free dancer and an oriental dancer.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's emancipation, the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and she championed the cause for the abolition of corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me.
The dancer says: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather the spirit from it.
The titles of her dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco to me.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangas.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance style also fits into this aesthetic", she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been his student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he accepted to work on my work and I am very honored".
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi by Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola by Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have been all-round dive, and who have always had many enthusiasts".
The work also contains some form of the life of this woman, which takes place in distant places, particularly for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, as usual, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers her and much less considers her work as something of value", says Bayon.
The show will begin today at 8.30pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
With the publication of the Diary of a Poet Newly Married, the Triennial also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Cultural Assessorate of the Andalusian Junta to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the re-release of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House-Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Cultural Advisor of the Andalusian Junta has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia de malcia" and gives the idea of the powerlessness of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
And yet it cost him a lot to get him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he's been retired.
And they also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of his existence".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerated.
He died a father of cinema and of the country at a particularly dark time, for fear of terrorists and markets, with the American people's self-esteem on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so hard, men so virtuous and still admirable, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, she embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won causes, from the Anti-Drug Foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of an overdose to the creation of the home-grown, organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has had to go beyond a suicide food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without regard for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man died, an age passed.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He set a very high standard for all of us", notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for righteousness and for a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some people try and Paul Newman is a good example.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful, though he certainly did not miss the opportunity to be.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is proud that his daughters are also his admirers on earth, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a passionate philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 attempt, this could happen in 2016.
I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were taken into account in the evaluation process and I had to examine it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the backrest, which assumed he was going first.
It didn't sound like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, it's to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid tails during the race).
No, not at all.
You had to go just to get the back (first stupidity, just go for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only 'S' size shirts (second stupidity, because I need an XL size).
What kind of world are we living in?
Is it the crisis that they decided to buy only small, less-fabricated shirts and therefore cheaper?
Well, things like that are inexpensive compared to the day of the race itself.
Besides having to go very early to get the chip, the queue was 15 minutes long and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected to attract more than 11,000 people.
So, as was predictable, the race started that we hadn't even put our backpack in yet, although once we were successful in the venture, the recovery turned out even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the 40-minute wait, which was accompanied by attempted popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
At least 500 people tomorrow will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, won't even be ranked in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, didn't record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if I'm asked about the perfect race, this is not going to come to my mind.
So I think we'll continue to dream of an Olympic city well prepared.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft previewed a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in Microsoft's illustrated case, a shuttle service to move around the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
With a camera and a system for recognizing shapes and faces, this receptionist is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group people into groups of conversation.
In the example video, the receptionist notices a third person, but realizes that she does not belong to the group she is talking to and that she is not a social worker.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and says that he will be available soon.
All without the blue screen.
- That's very impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will have fewer associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers had the essential functions and less commercial waste, they would go five times faster.
A complete discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version, has continually added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing its importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is essential for hardware and software to communicate.
You do the same job as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more attention to the web browser.
You just take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox -- or Chrome -- and every day we spend more time browsing the web than in a remote window environment.
What's half the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They really need it desperately, and I'll give you a small example.
I took the photo posted in this post at one of the recreation facilities for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
A sign on the liquor machine urges them to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, moreover, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be launched in the first months of 2009, but probably by the end of the year, if not even 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
Cell phones, after all, are becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is painful.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Costa Azzurra, Leonardo of Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and Al Pacino as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forced man with the pointed mustache lifting weights in the circus.
It's basically a typical men's shirt, with a cotton inside, sleeveless and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the English call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" stands out from the others for the high quality of the cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive coat of arms and the small (almost recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" stands out from the others for the high quality of the cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive coat of arms and the small (almost recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most emblematic shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And beware, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous tanks.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't bother me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
At present, the Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion venture very seriously.
For Monica, they're more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris that Mango's new headquarters was promoted, along with the presentation of the most important awards sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Hot and shy, he'll get you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the fall-winter Mango season, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
It's been a very busy day, but at the same time, exciting.
What elements do you have for your new Mango collection in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both like the movies of the '50s and '60s, and we get a lot of inspiration from that.
Then I love getting lost in the city and watching women dress, how they mix and match their clothes.
You're a dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even though in the end, it all comes together and there's a lot in common.
I loved clothes from my childhood; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to browse my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, as a dancer, I always paid close attention to my dress.
We know dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the sage, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you get your wardrobe, that's when you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you got into a crisis?
But no, I'm not.
Never felt better. I like the idea of 30.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience of enjoying life without making any mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl, and that's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body asks me to be a mother and I also want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not too worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're expecting some movies from last year to come out in different theaters.
That's right, and I really want them out.
As a woman coming from the theater, I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything to be immediately and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" to come out.
Let 's see if you like them .
You debuted on the runway a few days ago with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we showed -- I brought two pieces of our collection to Mango -- were auctioned off to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
There's so much being said about her, I know her for a long time, and I can tell you that's not true.
Besides, I'm with this good part of you being involved.
He asked me to march for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help women in the Third World, you can't back down.
Recurring drunk drivers will have to install an alcohol lock.
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol use to install in their car the system that prevents driving while intoxicated or if they are not breathing in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Prosecutor General, according to which it will be a pilot project of one year.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since he will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the Attorney General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation for Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) will also participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers who report drunk driving more than once return to driving.
Alcolock would avoid this, because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver is not breathing, or when a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is detected.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with such devices can reduce infringements committed during the first year of introduction by up to 65%.
And in Spain, it's estimated that it could save 115 lives a year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to curb these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for criminal procedure would require organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
The European Parliament will vote on a PSOE initiative to install this system in school buses tomorrow, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and no peep-toes.
At 5:40 p.m., according to the schedule, the Spanish plane carrying the Asturian princes landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well.
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the Asturian principles are and the importance of travel.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the 27 Navy personnel's military cord offering their respects.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, is wind-blown, very sober, does not wear her usual peep-toes, perhaps they have told her that Mexico City was threatened by bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before they go to the room where the official committee is waiting for them.
At the door of their hotel, one of the city's four largest, they are awaiting a spirited Mexican television reporter.
The Best Prize Fashion Can Offer
There is probably no place in the world more suitable to present a fashion award than Paris and probably there is no more exquisite and elegant designer than Valentino.
Mango has just launched the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in the fashion field.
He's offering a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, the Belgian winner of the first edition, Sandrina Fasoli, was looking at her drawings in the Mango window at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
It is also the company's second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square metres of space.
The first is in London.
The many events, coupled with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxurious dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
With the closeness of the finest Chagal canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, it was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a House dress and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy of almost two meters in height - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honours of the house and knighthood which he ended, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the store in pants and shirts  drawn by her own hand  transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the ballet room and she, recalling other times, grabbed a bar and drew a "grand plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the palace premises, but she had shown us her son's photos on her cell phone first.
The next day we were delighted to see Olivier Martinez, another young man riding his motorcycle, and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and making sure there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, there's the road.
1001, the stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic, hectic everyday life.
And as if that weren't enough, they're all gathered together in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
Wake-up is almost a punishment when you ring it every morning at 7:00, but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the frenetic rhythm of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is pain in the back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is no one or two methods for combating daily exhaustion and the difficulty of getting out of the world of work.
No, this number is nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage, or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in her book a "menu" of options tailored to each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress book is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calmness will reach bookstores thanks to publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone feels that it is not possible to achieve calmness in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "handbook" denies that belief.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline is not already flowing into your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, shut your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in Your Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I'm not talking about those who wake up very anxious to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but those children who talk while they're asleep.
The first time it happens, you're scaring at most, but it doesn't really matter much.
It's a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquy.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with a high fever episode) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes these are episodes linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night sweats (bed peeing), or sleepwalking, but this is not necessarily the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stressful situations or over-excitation.
In any case, it is still a relatively new phenomenon.
The intensity of its appearance is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (hurry, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be wise to observe the child and, if necessary, to consult a specialist to see if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We said that this is a benign alteration and therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stressful situations).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to over-excite the child before he goes to bed.
To promote calm games and to avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children who find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleepwalkers appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's unaware of what's going on, and you'd interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember, if you seem very anxious and the episodes are frequent, it is best to see a doctor or to see where such anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You'll get nothing, because he's asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you can hear what he says but not see what he dreams to say, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of information and the conclusions it may lead to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him questions at night to learn his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Something like that causes a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's just a few minutes long episode.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found their way home to victory after a long, fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Negroes created the most networking opportunities, turning one into a game win.
The pace was not very steady during this meeting where the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the guest team captain Kauffmann who took the seventh with a long shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other they provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a long distance, then Hirn tall, Romain top and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the center of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in the attack tip.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais' first net for the Illhaeusern, well placed, he recovered a ball thrown on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Danes will not be able to take advantage of this and will not cause any problems to the Ilhaeusern XI, who have only retreated to "strengthen" the defence, except in the very last minutes of play when, after a rockabilly action, the ball was crossing the line.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Britain.
In the face of the demonstration by the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning to enchant its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come forward with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that coincides with the general meeting of the 'Crisis Committee', set up by Breton fishermen to take measures to deal with the rise in the price of diesel, which reached its record high of over €1.14 a litre.
According to David Martinon, spokesman for the Eliseum, the President "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to ensure working conditions and salary for seafarers".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy standing still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "slum operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of jamming.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors already proved their determination by burning tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as they began demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to ports along the Atlantic and English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where fishing boats were stranded at the docks, or at Havre, where some twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, on the Atlantic Loire, have stopped the blockade of the famous Total Donges refinery in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they have decided to wait for the meeting to be held at the Ministry on Wednesday to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday on the future actions of the movement and on its possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the move.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not give up" and "they have no intention of moving to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gasoline, currently pay about 50 cents a litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with gasoline below 0.30 euros a litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have all hailed the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The aircraft manufacturer is counting 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest airline, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first half, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for the 30 to 120-seat range.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, a financial services company set up by the U.S. monetary authorities, would sell more than 15 percent of its assets to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider selling most of its assets, in addition to selling life insurance to the international market and the United States, the paper says on the basis of authoritative sources.
The AIG board met on Sunday evening to consider any divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was received from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to sell include the airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision on these divestments has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the cost of having the US authorities seize 80% of its capital.
The French government has been trying to get the government to stop the violence.
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic collapse on Monday after the House of Representatives voted against Paulson's plan to save financial institutions: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) is higher than on 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the leading technology securities index, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 extended index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralised at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal to the market, that Congress is unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market relied on the project", he added, fearing that in a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying . . . then the witness would quickly be passed on to the Fed  Federal Reserve and other central banks to resolve the crisis, further limiting credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief financial and economic officer at Global Insight.
And again highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged for Wachovia's banking assets to be bought by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent action in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are facing not just an American crisis but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasury Bonds fell to 3,632%, compared with 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year yield fell to 4,161%, compared with 4,357% the day before.
Obama in the lead in the first televised match
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates for the White House, here's a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters have announced the respective victory of the televised duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup poll, which a poll published Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat won the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39 percent of them considered Obama the winner, while 25 percent pointed to McCain.
A great performance by his list mate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has a good sense of humor", Bill Clinton warned this weekend, however.
McCain, 70, has never stopped promoting his undeniable foreign policy experience, pointing out the "naivety" of the opponent in the first-hand arguments.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he has often stated on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president", he assured.
This has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without any delay, it proved concise and precise.
He promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama", a Democratic commercial this weekend reiterated, reprimanding the Republican for not taking the necessary steps to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina in heavy rain for an election meeting.
The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the best person to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic insight to Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of poor economic policy adopted by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain".
Reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street riots, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided the highly unpopular, $700 billion bailout request that Congress passed last night.
In Minsk, "didn't you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents marched on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening shortly after the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn't even vote :"What's the point? They'll do whatever they want with my vote", says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression on foreign observers with the aim of reopening the dialogue with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian officials and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections are deemed legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the electoral committees and our observers were unable to participate in the vote-sharing", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, a diverse alliance of 12 parties.
"It is a change of scenery", says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case the executive.
If opposition deputies enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals".
The opposition has a duty to enter the political game as "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don't reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election process, will recognise the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation rates appear too high and that the generalization of early voting (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) has led to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you not notice that there were elections?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in parliament, the most suitable ones in power".
The night silence falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are complacent about their success.
The encounter - Blood is safe again
HEMA-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as HEMA-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the public's trust, seriously shaken by the blood-infected scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves run by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and public protests, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994 led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at shedding light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent a similar disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was delaying a report, some provinces set up a committee to devise a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was heartbreaking.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve blood test safety and field research over the following years, we have regained public trust", she explains before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the woman who has been its president since 1998.
"And we had no idea if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
We therefore based this on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, which states that when you have doubts and you may have a serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which manifests itself with a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, blood was refused to those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Now, for some years now, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode thus showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle".
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NTAs) that allow the presence of the virus in the blood of donors to be directly recognized, rather than antibodies against the virus, which were the basis of the tests used up to that time.
TANs have reduced the window period, from the time the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood through our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to identify them has been greatly reduced.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood samples will have to be distributed before anyone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years for a transfusion-transmitted HIV case to be detected.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health, says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the bloodstream by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant,' continues Dr Décary, before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Needs increase as the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has implications for the number of donors, which on average only make up 3% of Quebecers eligible as donors.'
However, all healthy persons who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who offer to be donors are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the disease is prevalent, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory that can meet the needs of hospitals.
The cases of shortages are very rare.
But the members of this group of donors need to be renewed as they age and are no longer able to donate.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to withhold it and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that it is hard to find an hour to donate blood", says bereaved Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, abounds with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank entry of our 1,000th cord blood sample and expect to take more than 1,000 each year.
They should be proposed for transplantation early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection practice as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", as Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the semi-final
Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-finals of the A-League, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday in a decisive second quarterfinal match at the Stadio Saputo.
Antonio Ribeiro, the midfielder, scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless first period on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Remember, in the first game of the round-robin on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundlers completed a 3-1 lead in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still be in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed later in the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and his aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and collected a pass for the win, in the fourth of Hab's preliminary games.
The only network signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable".
"He tried to overdo it in the first period", noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation".
Charest points north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the end of the Liberal Party General Council, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
'Expand the boundaries of our last great northern border': this is Jean Charest's longterm ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of visual instruments with a strong visual impact, at the Quebec Liberal Party General Assembly.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Image Mill".
On three maxi screens, they confused the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with Google Maps, maps, etc.
Big money like in the middle of an election campaign.
During the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The 'Northern Plan' is the fourth point of a 'project' the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a 'new economic space', which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be 'a jewel of immense potential', but did not comment on timetables or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities for future projects would be.
It merely pointed out what it considered to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has seen several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "two times the size of France" is here, Quebec.
It's not just here, it's in us", he insisted, as if to evoke a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future", he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind his back.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at a press conference.
"It's a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line that has not been agreed on for a long time and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government", he said.
In addition, "in view of climate change, the North must be reassessed", he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would be in their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP for the PQ of Ungova), have already opened the door to consultations with some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a major meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "common views will be provided"
The development of the North would be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'project' as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who have gone before us, we know how to stand out and turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party headquarters.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois power station into the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, the creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, which nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, the creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he made use of another conservative reference, this time the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In its comments on the project for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stated that its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will make it", he confessed to his activists, raising applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a polling in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It stresses that it is certainly very involved, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, particularly of 'constitutional aspirations' that went smooth as oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the draft North Plan has been met with skepticism.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, has backed the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
She said the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had, 'we would have made progress today,' Marois said alongside Jean-Talon's candidate, Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of Plan North.
"What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a spectacle", said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Justice Minister of the Harper Cabinet, who allowed himself to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "disgrace" to Canada.
Dishonoring a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and deserves all our admiration says a lot about the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We are now faced with a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated a citizen of its detained population to the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time the charges were brought against him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier to rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the defendant's guilt.
It is also important to note that the Commission has not yet decided on the basis of the present proposal.
It is precisely this same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We don't realize it yet, but we're witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", a word Harper keeps on bragging about and sounds so senseless on his lips.
We have reached a point where there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be mistreated, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned at the discretion of a minority government leader until now (see what happens after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches virtue, respect for law and order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Here lies the shame, Mr Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In the 17 September issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Managing Director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million defamation suit against three authors and a small, squattered publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in defamation cases, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to take a stand against his own.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publishers of the book Canada Black will have to spend a considerable sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly unlearned weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the pockets of the mining company with virtually no funds.
In these unprecedented armed conflicts, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that will silence the opposition and to frighten anyone who dares to speak out again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that it should have presented its own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are normally held by exchange of views and not by a slam dunk.
It would have been enough for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have much confidence in the public and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of the Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is clearly evident?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to the well-paid lawyers and not to the whole of Canada; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the denigrators have a say.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand  or doesn't want to understand  is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but based on civilian exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of mugging (in pursuit of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just issued an ultimatum to the authors of Canada Black urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal discourse, the lawsuit brought by Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It blocks the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics for the world's richest companies, and to file multiple lawsuits, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific norms as do the authors of Black Canada.
You have a right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as well as the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street  Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the top congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the largest savings plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been plaguing Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for checks on the effective implementation of the scheme by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new arrangements to contain the number of houses foreclosed on for failure to pay, and a right to inspect the salaries paid to the managers of the protected enterprises.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress toward an effective market agreement", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made to protect the American economy and people from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted this way, invaluable upheavals and upheavals would have been poured into the daily lives of Americans", said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a further bankruptcy on investors.
The deadline agreed was for the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidency, who joined the negotiations later, were rather supportive of the agreement, but did not hesitate to express their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular one that will allow owners to maintain their homes and one that concerns salaries for managers of state-owned enterprises.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary", he commented on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to ask if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to analyze the details, but I hope so".
"From what I've read, it's something we all have to digest and it'll keep us going".
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to use taxpayer money to buy back the dubious credits, risky assets and irrevocable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that led first to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (mutuations), then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulted in liquidity freezes and the dissolution of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge that aired the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems they have been out of the loop since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone, a provision was added to the Congress that if the government were to face losses over the next five years because of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for an initial payment of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion could be added if the President deems it necessary.
The 350 billion payment should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get a stake in the protected companies that will pay dividends on profits and sell it back when the waters calm down.
The plan provides that the Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to a vote of the House of Representatives, and a vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given the go-ahead.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the draft, both among the Republican and Democratic parties.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you", said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House finance committee, addressing his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not taking advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed the "sceptical caucus", Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us saying: we ask Congress not to jump to conclusions and to consider carefully the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the test of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would abandon the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) to the US mortgage crisis.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money", said the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos, yesterday.
In return, they gain influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It's certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain".
During this period, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seems to be nationalising another bank on the brink of financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be buying the branches and customer accounts of the UK bank.
Since the start of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
For a long time, blue-eyed beauty was her sleeve, for others her weakness.
You've got rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the cheerful smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful ones devoted to true holy monsters.
What a consistency!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the twentieth century.
Less monumental than Brando, who he resembled and was for a long time a kind of rival on screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but he was also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
Mixed couples often produce magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will come one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
Because he recognized himself as an untouched safe made man, a Pacific war fighter, proud of his combat skills, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale, he later attended the Actors Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the driver who placed second at the 1979 24 Hours of Mans, as well as a sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
He leaves with the shadows of a secretive, discreet, busy star, allergic to the scandals of show business, whose mystery will never be fully revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend, Paul Newman's passing was a heartbreaking one for film fans, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through its performances.
They confuse the memories of Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy and the boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Tin Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, he is remembered as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that failed to keep its promise.
Many other Paul Newman have gone down in history.
Rocky Graziano, the criminal, the tormented, the violent, the unforgettable in Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and resumed after his death, which he officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice bad guy in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Spit, Robert Rossen's magnificent film (1961), Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 out of 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was his.
He's the one.
The ages follow through her path.
Young people know him best for the cult film Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in which he plays Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in Mr. Hula Hoop, the Coen brothers, in 1994.
The circle had closed with a final role as Irish Mafia godfather in It's My Father, 2003.
Unlike most film legends who soon abandoned the profession, Newman will stay in the theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its boasting, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performances exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic, or desperate characters, of whom he expressed sway and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, was a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated the film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a quiet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old co-army partner Robert Redford (who had acted together in The Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with endless sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generousness and love of life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great civil rights, ecological, independent film activist, a Hollywood drift contender, is now extinguished.
We'll have her face splashed out on vinegar bottles, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging her a bad taste choice, even though she was born a gag.
However, the proceeds from these sales went to his Foundation for Disadvantaged Children.
Newman, instead of lying on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said, "Everybody and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it was just as privileged for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, then, and much more.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & Associates factories?
The hearing of the criminal case against János Zuschlag and his associates will be held shortly, on 8 October.
The politician and his associates are charged with repeated commercial fraud committed within a criminal association that caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
The Prosecutor's Office said that the money obtained from the bids was used by them for private purposes and that they often certified the activities by means of false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totalling 65 million florins, ended up in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in some cases in the pockets of some people.
According to the method disclosed by the investigating authorities, they withdrew the money obtained from the tendering procedures on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false.
For the purpose of making them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the market in Józsefváros, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on which company to issue the invoices, it was established, among other things, during the hill trip over Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for consumption, and the model of these was followed by the preparation of the invoices to be submitted to the tenderers, including those of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
A large part of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri who, according to our information, has written the reports necessary to obtain the financing.
One of the choices of Lados' "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 persons from Biztos Pont Egyesület.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, wouldn't all go into the restaurant together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of formal and substantive errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however, the bill included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fancy invoices exaggerated when they reported Pigal Kft., also a restaurant company, whose accounts - according to the information provided to the judicial authorities - did not even include documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and the match of our company Iva were in the wrong place".
He added that, apart from the formal reasons, there was no mention of the fact that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, when they have 11 rooms in total and there are not so many beds.
By the time the bill came through, it was catering and their restaurant had been out of business for a while.
The regular invoicers did not bother to learn that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only organises travel abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice that they were paying in cash for travel to Hungary, which was not in line with the company's invoice-issuing practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included in the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is VAT-free.
The amount of the Iva was also incorrect on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company's services were subject to the 15% and not the 25% VAT rate indicated on the invoices, and the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the 'issuers' have ruined other invoices, in the case of a firm they have indicated as activity carried out by road freight transport, as is known from the prosecutor's proceedings, which was not carried out by the company originally established as an investment consultancy.
Furthermore, it was found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont, of XXI, were false because of formal defects - a case formulated in non-conform invoice, a false stamp.
The same was true of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters also failed to pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when a group from Fiatal Városért Egyesület had lunch there in 2001 and that is why the company's liquidation curator, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They deliberately issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers is those who were aware of the need to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the foundation Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
It also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 provided invoices worth around 5 million florins to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, which did not have any real economic activity behind them.
Nor did the money move because the bills prepared were then cancelled, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing invoices includes those who are linked to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorised as the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not present there, who deals in fuel and vehicle trade.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of IT equipment, worth around FUR 18 million.
According to the investigation data, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005, purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov reportedly submitted documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the counter was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies was actually operating, because according to the defendant they had not received employment.
The companies were nevertheless useful to him because, at the request of the defendant, Mr Zsolt Szente, the editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov issued 15 invoices for a total value of FY14.2 million to the various entities.
The prosecution considers that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as the Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for Biztos Pont's tender.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a call for the Socialist Party's public utility body, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per person but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the invitation.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecution, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession has so far not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in return for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended at this point, as his demands for a reduction in his prison conditions, namely the granting of house arrest, have not been met.
While the perpetrators of unsolvable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can walk freely or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of over-bidding: Why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are more likely to spend more, to overvalue goods.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have uncovered the neuroeconomic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study in the journal Science, men do not want to lag behind in a bid like eBay's auction, so they are willing to pay a higher price.
Researchers have tried to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the nervous system level through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the main element is bidding more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex gets intensively functioning when you lose the game.
This area of the brain, along with other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-gratification" of the nervous system.
So the researchers say the price hike is explained by the intense reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists in the research group conducted a financial follow-up survey.
In this investigation, three groups tendered against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the actual value of the product concerned and made its bet.
Another group, besides this, was promised another $15 prize if they won.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose money if they lost at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By testing the neurologist's hypothesis, the members of the "loss" group were willing to bet higher than the control group or "win".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These have hitherto explained the phenomena of auctioning with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we have come to a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is the leading cause of death in Hungary.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients is 100,000, of which only 7,000 are treated.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name for infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical of which are hepatitis and yttrium, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. infected water and food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal leaks, saliva).
For travelers, it's helpful to get vaccinated against A and B viruses, there's no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots form on the skin and white of the eyes, the stool becomes clear and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is that only one in ten people is estimated to receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know they have the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, often with the first symptoms appearing after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and conduct regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease, it is worthwhile to see a family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
When the disease is recognized in time, it can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus ceasing its infectious power and preventing the formation of tumors.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by the World Association of Hepatitis.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, its causes of development and early detection.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as a sort of pain reliever that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists as possible, while all were watching a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholic believers were able to repel much of the pain.
Through the research technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of studies involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University.
The test went exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharge and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the experiment subject.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's Hermeline painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a religious status among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in that time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone was taking care of" them, and "they calmed down and were filled with peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image with strong effect even for atheists, but the appropriate image must be found.
"We need to find an image that makes them feel very positive, like a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the results.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality", Wright added.
After the excellent results, the only question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the day of their tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in people's pockets as much as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what kind of clinic they go to and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, that is not enough yet.
But as for the skeptics who compare themselves to the Orwellian nightmare, they don't really see the essence of Web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to adhere to the original goal of Google's founders which was: "let's put all the information in the world into one system!"
According to the Google CEO interviewed by the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it's still in the early stages of being able to handle all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said: "I wish Google could answer questions like, 'What do I do tomorrow?' or 'What would be the right job for me?', but software doesn't know how to answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that when they search the internet, they are recorded exactly what words they are looking for, from which IP address they are searching and on which page they stop after searching.
The use of Personalized Search, launched two years ago, enables users to store their browsing history, to look up what they have searched and clicked on, and to generate much better results in the long run.
What if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - users worried about Google's data monopoly ask themselves.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the internet users are caused by the fear felt for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but can also be provided to third parties in reasoned cases, in which case nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Google-run Orkut community page.
Internet users concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, sighed with relief in May when the firm - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even later, Google cannot be forced by any constitutional clause to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully seized nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search terms obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still has failed to obtain individual user search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear providing their personal data are spitting on Google because they believe that their privacy and privacy will be compromised by starting to use its services and are upset by the rebellion against the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft, liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both are fighting for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, doesn't ask its users for an identification code, doesn't ask for money for its services, the source code is kept updated and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which involves one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these changes for each individual, the essence is the same: show us ourselves.
A young average can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, can insert them into systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also write blogs where his latest photo galleries are automatically displayed on Flickr or Picasa.
In the meantime, we read of numerous examples of how the girl, seeing the series of pictures taken in the morning by her friends, can easily tell who her treacherous boyfriend spent the night with or whether a company can fire an employee because he wrote a sincere opinion on the top of the company: one thing is for sure, the concept of privacy has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live online live in a way that shows themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time not leaving traces voluntarily).
There are not many people who don't deliberately sign up for community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from word processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions that aren't tied to huge server parks and that don't make up our best profile yet.
The public is not even waiting in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
The company's $156 billion worth is now worth more than IBM's ($140 billion), Intel's ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola's ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens advertising agencies' revenues, and services introduced in record time cause major problems not only for Microsoft but also for many software development companies.
However, critical observers alongside all this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, completely rejected the protest of employees after doubling the line of the company's kindergarten, considered repeated dining for the daily pleasure of employees too expensive, but all this belittles the fact that in 2006 Google turned the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter out all results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the firm seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, but one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will move the world to a point: while some believe that Google's scanning and archiving project of books and magazines will take on proportions such that the firm will soon be in front of the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the famous Cory Doctorow's Scroogled story describes the future with Orwellian accents, where a man with Google data can be approached in a frightening way.
Two minors helped the double murderer of Ózd to make his tracks disappear.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, who were well-founded suspects of helping to dispel the traces of the crime, the Borsod Police Questor spokesman said on Tuesday.
The young men have confessed to the crime against them, they are currently charged with aiding and abetting.
The two minors, two girls, according to MTI information, are defending themselves on their own.
Favouring is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man from the area, was placed under house arrest on Sunday.
He's a suspect in multiple counts of premeditated murder for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, so last Wednesday he deceived his creditor into a construction site in Ózd where he killed himself and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, one sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon on the spot.
Police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered €200 million, or about 5 billion Czech crowns, to buy 100% of the shares listed on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 says that the Polish offer represents the highest figure ever for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner among all interested parties and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5 to 10 billion crowns.
Under the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Česká Spořitelna Bank with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13,5%.
The economic crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on the international economic crisis on Tuesday already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster was caused by the American president - the Republic accuses him of it - who was unable to consolidate his party behind a law that was quickly repealed, with the aim of remedying a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire super financier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11 attack.
Even a part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, reports the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a bailout doughnut to sluggish financial institutions and with taxpayer money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as a domino effect then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control over the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, the Vienna Der Standard reports.
The EU has so far not been too concerned about the crisis that has swept through the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'saviors' must not immediately throw away the €100 billion, but it would be better if they decided when to touch taxpayer money to prevent further damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the lobster
What better way to develop collision-control technologies than to imitate obstacle sensors found in nature?
Like the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the horns gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic boost on how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biometric robot, a robotic miniature car with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really closely resembles our protective shield - Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR and R&D technology sector, explained at the exhibition.
The role of the bee's vision is important, as it can see 300 degrees in any direction.
Engineers have used the idea of a telemetric laser to copy the function of the bee's vision.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a control to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the robot senses the obstacle and then, imitating the bee's movements, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels the size needed to avoid the accident.
This avoidance, unlike the current system, is carried out entirely instinctively.
"If it wasn't for this, the robot car wouldn't react quickly to avoid collisions", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steerability of the wheels.
So instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
BR23C is powered by lighter lithium-polymer batteries with a high energy density, which means that their lifetime is higher than lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh says the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot needs to process some input in a matter of seconds and react.
You don't need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so you only use a few tens of Kb of memory.
You don't need a gigabytes or a megabyte of memory.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate collision avoidance that Nissan predicts will be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Further application may be achieved by integrating it with the GPS satellite navigation system, which avoids obstacles on the road leading to the destination.
They also found the name of the very expensive baby.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout bill has been drafted for the purchase of disproportionate credit, to be applied in multiple parts.
The first step is to spend half of the sum.
In the new agreements, which lasted until midnight Saturday, according to East Coast time, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after days of debate, Reuters reported.
We have made some serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairwoman of the US House of Representatives, saying that the only thing left to do is to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the compromise would work and be effective, but there was still much to be done.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. local time (Monday 2 p.m. central European time) but did not bring about a major growth in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft economic stabilisation law of 2008, which concerns the programme, and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi Saturday night, then he cheered the news of the deal at the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which predicted that the $700 billion would be spent all on the purchase of bonds with disproportionate credit behind them.
Now as a first step, you can spend up to half of the $700 billion, $250 billion right after the vote in Congress on Monday, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credit behind them, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special board will oversee the program, which also includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion is dependent on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy loans, mortgages and bonds with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly - the relevant authorities of the Ministry have announced.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the means of concern for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the probable damage.
Mr Henrz Paulson said that the law provides the means to get $700 billion into the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it be buying the wrong financial means, or insuring them, or avoiding the risk of a major financial institution collapsing.
We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the newly signed law, he added.
Instead, the managers of banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think the government will limit their goodwill, defined by overseas slang simply as gold parachutes.
The limitations on payments will only apply in certain cases and will depend on how the Treasury Department will offer the aid.
The limitation essentially means that if the Ministry buys in an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute unless they retire the bankrupt bank manager.
When the direct purchase of disproportionate loans is made, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not exaggerated.
In addition, existing contracts for the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on the pay of CEOs has been put in place, said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the State has the right to appropriate a share of the participating banks, reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they can also ultimately benefit from the recovery of the economy and the bank saved.
The bill includes the President submitting to Congress a proposal for how to reimburse taxpayers for expected losses from the financial sector over the next five years.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed doubts about the project.
This is not what the American people have asked us to do, not defend taxpayer dollars, said California Republican Democrat Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that the actions were taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continue to rise
National industrial sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0,1% compared to the previous month, by 12,9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Statistical Institute.
The prices of the export sales of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher than 1,1% and fell by 3,9% compared to the previous year.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were higher by 0,7% compared to the previous month and by 3,2% compared to a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales in the previous month increased only by 0,1%.
The domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sector also increased by a minimum of 0.1% compared to July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in the leather and footwear processing sector (2,8%), especially bags and belts, with 4,6% and footwear production with a monthly increase of 2,5%.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemical sector.
Prices decreased in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a lesser extent in the wood processing sector (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing remained the same.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water sector, prices increased by 0,3% in August in industrial domestic sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, the largest increase in domestic sales of the processing industry was in the oil products processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of metalworking products, prices increased by 13.2%, and by 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which represent a decisive factor.
Prices decreased in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the electrical equipment and machinery industry (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price increases varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
Overall, in the manufacturing industry prices rose by 10.2% in the previous year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded last year's prices by 18.7%.
In the domestic sales of the target groups of sectors, the largest increase in monthly prices occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the consumer goods sector prices increased by 0.3%, in the energy and after-use sectors prices remained unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, the biggest increase in prices was observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16,8%), compared to the same month last year.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, and for investment goods, a decrease of 1.4%.
Industrial export sales prices in FUR increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, decreasing by 3.9% in 12 months.
The Hungarian florin weakened against the euro by 1.7% in one month, against the dollar by 7.1%, and strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar in August 2007.
Next year in the U.S. without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungary visa-exemption agreement could come into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister has discussed this in Chicago with local Hungarian representatives.
In his view, "it now all depends on whether the electronic access and control system is built overseas in time".
He pointed out that the new system will no longer allow entry, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian diplomat will continue the talks in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, who will be awarded the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with Star and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also took a stand for the bank bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the government's $700 billion plan to bail out banks, but there are politicians who are demanding the Treasury Secretary resign.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after days of marathon negotiations on Sunday night announced they had reached a deal in principle on the bank bailout plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of frozen credit market failures have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove more capable than their rivals in getting the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest economic polling, Obama has regained some of his advantage, while McCain's advantage gained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection measures which he also supported.
"Now we must act responsibly . . . , the danger is threatening your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability", he said before a crowd of 35,000.
He didn't let himself get away with calling McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "everyone will be hard pressed to bring this down . . . but doing nothing is not a viable path".
The Republican senator said the proposal included the creation of a finance minister's monitoring committee and limiting the good outcomes of top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit role in the deals, instead he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press release from the German-speaking world
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole have voters become more self-aware - so Der Spiegel analyses the weak CSU result in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation.
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents, analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
Christian socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was achievable exactly ten years ago was completed: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state was over.
As recently as 10 years ago, in 1998, CSU had fallen to 47.7 percent, the first time it had fallen below the 50 percent threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 again during the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is because of the continuous modernization in the region, which is consuming parents.
The sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but they were wrong about the timing, but secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation is accompanied by increased opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole have voters become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It's also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from CSU: the freelancers, the craftsmen, the graduates and the graduates.
Here support for CSU has fallen below 40%.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper "Who with whom?" in its article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing domestic political situation in Austria created by the elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public television the party leaders have barely shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed his willingness to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any event.
Repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has reacted cautiously to red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
If your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still an open matter in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
The BZÖ leader Jörg Haider reiterated his openness in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take on the responsibility of governing", Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, organised this year by France, with the EU's turn-based presidency, has opened in Paris.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP from the European People's Party, in her message to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress, called attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
The French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimír Špidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was attended by governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and human rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, Mr Járka recalled that, in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low education.
"Most young Roma do not have a medium-level degree and as a result of poor basic education only a small number of them can achieve a higher degree".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right and a key role in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
The honourable Member said that the wider context of Roma and non-Roma relations should be made aware of.
The sooner a Roma school starts, the more likely it is to become a productive member of the labour market; income taxes and consumption contributions contribute to the national budget.
"The right to European citizenship for Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools", stressed Lívia Járóka.
The European Union's unity of purpose and action is needed to accelerate the process of desegregation of schools and, according to the MEP, the proper respect of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is therefore of paramount importance.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be stopped, and Roma children must be given the opportunities of the democratic space so that they can contribute fully as citizens to the future of Europe", Járóka asked.
In the context of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' to be ensured for all, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, is to provide a single forum to promote the anti-discrimination and equal opportunities objectives set at national and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the stale Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the heads of the Bavarian CSU leaders have not yet been taken to the table.
The party chairman Erwin Huber and the regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in their posts, the question is how long mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two critically acclaimed politicians have said they are not being forcefully attached to the chair.
They tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" they demanded personal consequences for losing the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union achieved 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber it has fallen to 43.4%.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "absolute monarch" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of Germany's GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region are still important to the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to coalite anyway in the future.
As a first sign of the reorganization within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gains a seat in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the right-wing Free Electors for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup d'etat opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple to treat the woman with great ambitions without regard.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their efforts to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber, who has been in the shadows for some time, will also take an active role.
On Monday, Huber issued some statements to the CSU that they deserve more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a key role in the 2005 national victory, is restored with common strength.
Merkel, who is not hiding her disappointment with the failure, said the loss of CSU ground would not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
The problem is that the CSU is not going to be easy to manage, but the crisis of the Social Democrats is still going on.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria at 18.6%.
The Council has not yet adopted a resolution.
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is a sign of the well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, and according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by the voting scams.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (UDF) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, with his presidential term renewed for the fourth time following constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections held under the circumstances discussed, would "grant" some seats in Parliament to opposition representatives.
The SCO thus waived a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has asked for a loan to reduce the increasingly expensive Russian natural gas imports and has agreed to give the Russians the Beltransgaz gas pipelines that run through the country, was seeking to improve relations with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter due to the political situation in Belarus that is considered to be anti-democratic.
He referred to a distinction that the OSCE has made in evaluating the election campaign on positive moves rather than shortcomings, such as a ban on one third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, the opposition says that there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to make a small comparison with Moscow and continues to deny Georgia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has already considered the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate in the 2006 election, it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that "the government has been afraid to bring even one opposition into a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results but rather tries to convey to the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the most officially assisted group, the pensioners, does not consider it appropriate for the Lukashenko regime which considers the creation of social security as its main achievement.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increasing economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security "reminiscent of the silence of the grave", Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than a test of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in Palazzo Chigi's history that there were rotating doors for employees to enter and exit.
But starting today, this new measure is against the cunning, against the stamping, and then he goes to the bar for coffee during business hours.
The new anti-flames news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Rotating doors", says Brunetta, "are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services", says the minister.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism", Brunetta continues.
The installation of Palazzo Chigi is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and everyone cooperated".
I mean, no more breakfast during business hours, no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's words, which suggest, smiling, "a nice 7 a.m. cappuccino is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In the case of Rome, the minister also notes that "in three months sickness absences from public employees have decreased by 50%, i.e. an additional 60 000 people in one year".
It also stresses the need to make public administration more efficient.
The Minister explained that the wage dynamics of the Italian economy over the last 8-10 years have been double that of the private sector and well above inflation rates.
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta Decree by joining the Codacons' appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Works is today flagging numbers about the lowest number of sickness-related absences from work - writes the consumer association - the population of 'working cattle' is growing steadily.
In fact, thousands of decent and productive public servants in Italy have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree".
In particular, the Court will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatment for disability dependent on service; the extension of the available time slots for sick workers, within which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat the risks of accidents at work.
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
In fact, for 2007, Inail data confirms that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, Anmil is celebrating today in all the Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Workplace Accident Victims, which is being instituted on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data circulated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial importance of prevention at work", says President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to the President of Anmil, the National Association of the Handicapped and Handicapped at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The President of the Republic expressed his "deep appreciation for the constant association commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and public awareness".
"A genuinely shared indignation has naturally arisen in the face of tragedies that, by their size, have caused media outcry and public engagement but daily reality brings us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness of young people looking to work are particularly significant.
It is necessary to keep the phenomenon alive, not to be alarmed about its social gravity, but to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to bring it to an urgent end".
"The data on workplace injuries seem to indicate a slightly positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive", said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'downward trend' to result in less attention, because it is when attention is relaxed that tragedy strikes.
"We believe that there is still too little to do to combat the phenomenon of accidents at the general level and that the contrast can be exerted through multiple actions.
We believe that greater controls and inspections are needed, but also that greater training for workers is needed, starting from the school world".
'It is necessary to make further efforts to communicate and raise public awareness.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency".
Mercandelli also denounced "the gradual deterioration in the levels of compensation protection for workers' victims" and the "assistence derivative towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
'The aim is therefore to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker,' he added, 'so that the fate of the injured person should not depend on spontaneity or the periodic release of the workers by the legislature.'
MP3 players under indictment, endangering hearing
Listening to music at high volume for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
The European Commission, in a communiqué in Brussels, quoted the opinion of the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (CSRSeri), published today.
"This scientific opinion", the note reads, "shows that 5-10 percent of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to music with portable musical instruments weekly for more than an hour a day while holding the loudspeaker risk permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical instruments and high-quality cell phones may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings - continues the EU official - present a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is that we must raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology".
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the directive to the Member States.
'Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and related equipment.'
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
These damages can be greatly reduced by reducing noise levels and exposure duration.
In its opinion, the European Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limits on maximum permissible noise at work.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of five years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital, which has set up its new headquarters this morning behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commissioners will draw up the Rome guidelines.
Once the talks are closed in March, the Board and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the official press release of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there", emphasises Alemanno.
There is no overlap of roles, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
It will be finished in March and then dissolved, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome, the capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there is quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics is crushed on the daily management and on the emergencies that come up from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The mayor of Rome also points out that "this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the citizens of Rome and will serve to reason and involve the best intellectuals expressed by the capital".
Germanno said that "it is necessary to have a strategic reference plan, not closed or stationary, to allow our city to make a real leap of scale, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician who wants us to be independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big, tough face: he thinks he's going to win the highest office in a nation that's ever had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial in nature and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president?
Again, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi in the southern United States wrote an editorial: Once in the ballot box, we know exactly who the American patriot will vote for.
It's a side of the American mindset that's been kept covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, and then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain".
Some people swear, if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly seems to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his term. 89 percent said Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the ass.
There are 4,500 soldiers in Iraq who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet Iraq was for the most part Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
In the United States, the economic downturn is also felt in journalists: it's time to cut newspapers, and many blame the Internet for the "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and their mental controls regarding the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly state that they were less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
And the cuts in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the papers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten senior newspapermen and executives are convinced that journalism nationwide is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are opening a doorway to the Internet, viewed by many as the "killer" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run newsrooms -- that is, the editors -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national executives are confident their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage drops to 23%.
Some people think it's about "job safety".
Executives who think they'll lose their jobs within three years are 47% nationwide.
For staff reporters, it's 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
The directors are almost always paid a large salary, while the editor can earn up to $10,000 a month, in addition to the pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, to be fair, often get sick during the year.
It's all about the weather.
The Court of Rome, Daniel Coppola remains in custody
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the appeal of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl counterclaim investigation.
During the trial, last week, he obtained his discharge from the homeowners' quarters which was converted into a residence requirement in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial town to a residence in the capital.
However, according to the court, these moves (which the PM opposed) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the House vote against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirmed this yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to those in Washington and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, by the way, which has become overwhelmingly alive with the vote I mentioned at the beginning.
But this is just one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake may be predicting or already leaving to be seen: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
In both the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of long-incubated phenomena that solidify in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these is the realignment, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of state sovereignty in relation to a sort of renalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, close links with foreign countries, but which first and foremost involve very broadly the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who are also elected officials.
I mean, the crisis seems economically global but politically it's almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of the game or to have little to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union, which is divided as usual between different interests and different state strategies and is unable to decide on any common policy.
And so it is that from the government of each individual state everyone expects interventions, rescue and rescue plans, new rules, and above all, funding: since when you get to the bottom of it, only the states have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to get things right.
They also have the necessary means and the right to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which no market or international organization will likely ever have in a comparable way.
This new emphasis on the national-state element is also in perfect harmony with the growing importance that recent economic developments tend to attach to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the net, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that the globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future would instead have to increasingly deal with those very intangible things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at it a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are still absolutely bound to a confined space, to a territory.
So whoever is in charge of it certainly has several more cards than whoever is not, who is unlucky to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news, however, which predicts a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who can take matters into their own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing, economically-specific leaders, turned out to be so inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
And together something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: a discredit, a lack of suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is, it seems to be increasingly taking place, in a wide range of people, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites that have been in power so far, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, they have made their own time and are increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, undergroundly fuels a branched but powerful movement to delegitimize the ruling classes and traditional political backgrounds, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral uprisings or the sudden upheavals of the collective mood of recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, some would say, are making it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, growing, potentially agitating to the brink.
In the face of all this, talking about a 'mass rebellion' on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not at all.
The Super Glue for Walking on Walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and walk on walls like Spiderman in the future.
It's the target of several American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
With a sticker of just two and a half square centimeters, the researchers were able to stick a 100-kilogram body onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDY  The American journal Science published the findings of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have drawn inspiration from geck legs, which are covered in microscopic hairs that ensure perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the reptile's legs and at the same time, "it easily detaches from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive", Liming Dai adds.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
I'm not a superhero right now.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a microfiber-like adhesive that self-cleans from dust when moving on a surface to maintain a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, which are mainly consumed in summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, when taken with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption by increasing or decreasing their efficacy, depending on the case, with serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has warned of the dangers of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with certain medicines, and has issued a new warning since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: One glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, cancel out the beneficial effects and put patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under indictment for allegedly increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamines and neurological medicines to levels considered toxic.
RISK FARMACY - The same Italian Drug Agency had reported this in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to be careful what you drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
Not ONLY Pomegranate - Experts say that orange juice and apple juice contain drugs that inhibit medication.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
This is the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These findings are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may change the information notes on medicines.
So always read the medical information sheets and if there is something that is not clear, don't let us be impressed but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neokeynean who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron was failing, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked many controversies and was for years challenged by the economist, but now proved accurate.
I am surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention, Krugman had said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a "very aggressive" publicist, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excess liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
It's the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystems oversees, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: the welcome screen and the revised and less Spartan interface, more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Also noteworthy is the interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting features of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing form, keeping the original look of the page.
Also on this front, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical Adobe graphics format with elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some of OpenOffice's features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD may also be sent to the home or workplace upon request.
And if the theme of free can be a catalyst for the spread of the word in the home, it is in the business world that the Open Office suite is trying to make the big bet, already relying on several projects in the public administration and schools.
And there are also companies that offer training, consulting and support services for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing in contrast to Word; Calc, the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and given that we are now at almost 3.600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive. It's the fourth doping case.
Another positive case in the last Tour de France: the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported by the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at the third-generation Era, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is one of those that were done in recent weeks by the laboratories at Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the re-analyses confirm the positive in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and face two years of canonical disqualification.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the news of Kohl's third-generation EPO positive status and told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive status.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber jersey.
The question is, is Italy racist?
Italy "has only recently become a prime destination for immigrants" who are reluctant to be welcomed.
This is what is making Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what is being asked in a long article in the New York Times which has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those with "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation the League wants to tighten the barriers to immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students who are victims of high-rent rent up to €900 per room
The university rental market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenant union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples, 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on a very serious character, to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families from their home countries should bear", explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office at Sunia.
In most cases, rental offers then contain a series of violations: free, unregistered, no-fee limit, linked sub-leases.
The Sunia needs special measures which, through the revision of the taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 euros for a single bed.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are charged for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move to outlying areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single bed in Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room costs 400-600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
The cost of a bed is 250/350 euros, or at least 350 euros for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater impact on the urban economy.
In the cities where rents to extra-Community students are more frequent, such as Perugia, there is an additional anomaly: an increase of about 25/30% in the fee charged to foreign students compared with that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historic theaters
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without a cinema is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively captures what is happening in the large Italian urban centres but also in the provincial cities.
The process of film marginalization, with the emergence of large-scale cinema in the outskirts and the consequent death from consumption of monosaurs in the central areas of cities, is one of those events that seems inevitable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
Historical places and memory-laden places often disappear, "it's like losing a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of the street and so many emotions", notes the director of New Paradise, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of artists, are clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the biggest costs are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna, with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian exercise has developed irrationally notes Paolo Protti, President of Anec, 'it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its attendees are willing to move into multiplexes.
The Commission has not yet decided on the basis of the draft budget.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
Between €16 and €18 million a year would be needed to support the sector.
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about the closures, decided to run to shelter with the signing of a protocol between the Comune and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote monosacred cinema in both the historic centre and the suburbs.
The rules include tax relief measures for operators and public mobility benefits: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area and will have special parking fees and parking spaces.
It is an initiative that I like observes Giuseppe Tornatore' and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by setting up other measures.
However, it is true that to combat the overload of multiplexes, traditional halls must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the Rialto or the now closed National Street Quirinale, where I've lived through so many shared emotions, to avoid seeing the black-dusted signs I turn to the other side.
Political ties and the arrested mayor of Joia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the choices of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli leg".
The charges brought by the magistrates of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for outside competition in a mafia association, are serious.
Also in custody are Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew, the lawyer, who is the boss' namesake, already convicted of association for mafia-style delinquency, and sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"In disregard for any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to Piromalli.
"It would have been so allowed to the leg", the judges write, "to enter officially within the municipalities, facilitating the already vast possibilities of control and administration by the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collaborations between local authorities and organized crime are numerous" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean".
This morning's arrests follow those of last July when police announced they had decapitated Piromalli's rib.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991, and again due to alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of its dissolution, had been elected leader of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 vote.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called in the case of the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli rib had even come to ask for the change of the A3 project.
The environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM writes, have revealed "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group notoriously close to the Piromalli, while aligning the public administration's choices with the interests of the cradle".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones come out.
It's an extinct field, occupying over 70% of the planet's surface, and now it's being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources they've set their sights on, and now they're trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 1970s, at the same time as the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When oil prices fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental concerns and the new rise in oil are giving the industry momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by offshore wind turbines.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there'd be the currents and tides.
Colossal to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy and these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering cooperation with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to start a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is a not uncommon signal, especially considering that in Alaska the United States continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also taking the sea-based energy route and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate an upward trend, observers say.
Technology to be improved.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubt about its environmental impact.
At present, plants such as those in Portugal or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to pose any major problems to the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, we must use technologies with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The wave thrust, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by piston and cylinder within the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
There are four such plants currently under development, pending federal approval only and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the turbine blades to spin, creating a rotating motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Electricity Research Institute, deserves the potential of the tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It's precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that overlook the coast, already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and projected up to $35 million in 2009.
