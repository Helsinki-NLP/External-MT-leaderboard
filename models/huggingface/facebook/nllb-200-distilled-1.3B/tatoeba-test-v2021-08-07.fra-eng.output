White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4 - checkmate and mat! This is what is jokingly called in chess circles the  mat of the madman .
White: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8, Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, wild on b8. White puts opponent in zugzwang by playing the turn on a6, after which Black has only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their wild to any other square on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances their pawn from b6 to b7 and offers check and mate. In the second situation, White takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
