The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefit of Colour People (NAACP) has published warnings for colour people traveling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, with effect from August 28, 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and inhabitants of Missouri to pay more attention when traveling across the country as a result of a series of controversial racial-motivated incidents that are currently occurring throughout the country,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said that this step was taken on the basis of current Missouri laws that facilitate the defense of racist-motivated acts in court, as well as the result of the actions of criminal proceedings that are disproportionately targeting minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are arrested by the police only because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed,” said for Kansas City Star NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel.
“We’re getting the greatest number of complaints.”
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization issued to the state of the United States.
Among the incidents the organization cited were racial-motivated harassment against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he had a gasoline in his journey across the state and was arrested by police without accusation of committing a crime.
The Travel Recommendation also highlights a recent statement by the Missouri State Supreme Prosecutor's Office, which states that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by the police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared – they should carry the money to pay the guarantee or warn their relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the current figures of the FBI program to report hatred acts, there were a hundred cases of hatred behavior in Missouri in 2015, bringing the state to the 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law that facilitates the complaint for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the states approved an immigration law that allows government officials to arrest people on the basis of a violation of this law, which according to ACLU is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recently lawyer groups have applied to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
She was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family is unhappy.
Model Sally Anne Bowman is killed.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by the chef Mark Dixie directly in the restaurant in which she worked.
The victim and the murderer had sex and smoked marijuana and then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the careful criminal work of searching the place of the crime.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for murder and rape of model Sally.
The court only acknowledged the attack of the teenager and the lawyer claimed that his client found the girl dead on the street.
Three years later, the police sentenced him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sprotson had fatal night disputes.
The killer said, "He was seriously angry and after his attack the girl began to scream."
“It even attracted the attention of the taxi drivers,” he said liarly.
The girl, according to his statement, had to defend, but she could, of course, in vain.
Lewis had killed her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven as a lie and accused him.
After admission, Dixie talked about his tenderness and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her former girlfriend, drunk alcohol and took cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally began to scream for help, so he attacked her from the back and placed her hand through her mouth,” the Mirror Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by the vandals destroying her tomb.
He has been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people at freedom who excavate these tombs.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror mother of the deceased girl Linda revealed information about the disappearance of the urna with ash.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they had always to attack when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
“The Czechs are neither sharp nor conservative,” says Martin Ráž, who operates the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic tools.
This is the story of the Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started unseen, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip to Moravia.
One of them brought not only a wheel, but also a box full of unusually looking vibrators.
"A variety of dwarfs and dolphins and all it was green and yellow and simply completely different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend and one partner decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of design erotic tools Fun Factory, which Martin was interested, and so offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to engage in another profession, he replaced him.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street a boutique of Intimity, where it sells erotic utilities in the way that luxury pockets or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
These are also design objects.
Moment, moment, you’re talking about this at lunch, do you think?
Don’t be such puritani!
The Berlin Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served the Intimity boutique as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than they are all used to here.
No covered outlets, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed rather than in the perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelka began to consider how to get the Prague trade, where it should be and how it should be named.
The name is loved by both.
“It’s related to intimity and it’s also, can be said, gentle,” he says.
It followed the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went parallel to various interior visualizations.
Finally, the variant won, which distributed the store into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, which is dominated by the bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
The space was found in 2013.
At first it didn’t seem perfect to us because it wasn’t on the main street, but again thanks to it he sat to the name of Intimity.
It is intimate.
It’s in the street next to the main, so no one shakes the customers,” Martin Ráž praises.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a shop that will be different, with brand goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed for entering such a business at all.
When I entered the Intimity shop half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
In addition, I didn’t even feel like I’d go to the erotic help shop.
Right next to the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from the boutiques with fashion.
Although there is only a female servant in the store, so that women don’t hesitate to ask for help, it doesn’t mean that the male foot doesn’t come here.
Most of the men go shopping gifts for their girlfriend.
"Men mostly don't know how to estimate the right size and choose a bigger," Martin smiles on a frequent mistake.
These are such those prejudices, those experienced cliques that women need some great help, and it’s not true.
Therefore, a man in good faith will choose an unnecessarily big vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black clothes, while women typically tend to a pink color.
The bestseller is a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face must be clear that I don’t know which beat, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is an untouchable clitoris stimulator.
Pere is in me the teenage need to take up with admiration of how serious the interpretation is given to me.
As if it didn’t.
In fact, it doesn’t fit.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn’t believe he was so well accepted.
This is the last revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a sea horse-shaped vibrator.
He took care of the fact that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe vibrator.
He completely broke the taboo, which in some men can persist, and that he sees competition in the erotic tools.
“There are various variations,” he continues.
With one engine, two engines, with remote control.
This is the favourite category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain breakdown is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least at us.
Czech women appear to prefer multi-purpose utilities and buy classic vibrators, although they use it only externally.
It is very popular in Western Europe, especially with younger customers.
And the men?
It’s hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be seen a little differently.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have help for them, but in a limited extent."The most is sold primarily by the masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
He focuses a lot on functionality and the experiences of use.
In Japan it is completely different.
This is surprised in me.
I thought Japanese women would suffer a lot of erotic aid, I argue.
“This is the internet reality,” it is explained to me.
The everyday is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic tools are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are a taboo for women."Only for interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not good.
On the contrary, we are a very friendly nation.
Unfortunately, unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and has already some experience, one with sexual life, one with some help.
It will come for something nice, more quality, by which it would complement the partnership life, or for itself." about returning, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelka care so that they convince each product whether it is perfectly functional.
We also don’t want to go into the specialty of bondage and latex, because on the one hand we don’t have room for it, on the other hand it doesn’t fit here.
Such things could disrupt those we are trying to target.
There are people who have always had a shame to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would look out on them.
A lot of the products displayed on the roofs are really pleasant.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
In general, the first award was the mentioned marine horse "and this caused a change throughout the industry.
It began to go away from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-free, different designs, different colors began to be produced.
The pleasant is that behind the design of some stands the Czech Republic, namely the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite delighted by how many people buy those design things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls from Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting within the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that the erotic help can be done differently, nicely, with the story.
Annin's story began as a schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also manufactured with us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it’s not a large-scale, but a small series, it’s more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I’m going a little against the current, but it seems important to me to keep the development with us in the Czech Republic.
It could be quiet that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything,” Anna later describes the situation, which with Martin agrees that our company is increasingly open.
There is no negative or rejecting attitude.
People are supposed to be disappointed.
"But you also begin to smile."Today, Anna Mareš has a vibrator on her offer, which you can make a personal message, and this year she plans to make her own lubrication gel.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other news should be added.
Boundaries of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what is right.
Is there anything that Martin Rage would no longer sell?
It is very difficult to define.
What comes normal to one, to the other may seem completely abnormal, so rather we define ourselves by a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them are going to any extreme.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the most crazy demand they received?
Just now in the week came an email in which some lady asked for a masturbation help for her friend with a nature of twenty eight centimeters long.
So we had to write that we unfortunately have nothing like that.
It’s still the question if anyone of us didn’t joke,” Martin meets me with a suspicious look.
This happens from time to time...
Injury for Karl Gotta.
Two Alzheimer’s cancers.
His friend Karel Štědrý is suffering from a serious illness.
The best friend of Karl Gotta is struggling with a disease that will steal all the memories of people.
“Yes, it’s unfortunately true,” confirmed the sad information of the Lightning singer himself.
I am aware of my illness, and I am still able to do it because of the circumstances.
"I take medications that have the accompanying phenomena of the disease to slow down," he added, thanking the loved ones for support.
The whole branched family went on to make Charles's life easier.
The wife of Eva tries to be at home, as much as it goes, after the father to the house on the White Mountain, the daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, the old son of Karel said Karlas.
He fought with cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavík to support him in his difficult treatment.
It has 60 chemotherapies.
He was able to go back to work on the tennis court and on the ski routes.
“Astrologist has forecast that I will be here until the ninety,” said Karel Blesku.
He is a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
“I repeat the words of the songs so that I don’t forget them,” Karel acknowledged.
At the same time, the actress Květa Fial is now fighting the same disease.
Do you have Alzheimer’s in your family?
Look how to behave with him.
The Chilean parliament has repealed the ban on interruptions, the law will evaluate the US.
In Chile, there is no prohibition of artificial abortion, and therefore it is not allowed to be performed for health reasons.
“I’m sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we’ve been discussing in parliament for more than two years,” socialist senator Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and is expected to receive a new president by the end of August, which is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law repealing the absolute ban of interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it says it violates the right of the unborn child to live.
The vote on the draft law was delayed last month until it was analyzed by a mixed parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, the parliament approved the proposal and the Senate re-approved it.
According to the new legislation, artificial interruption of pregnancy should stop being criminal in three cases: if the life of a woman is in danger, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, in Chile since 1931, that is, even before there women were granted the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute ban of interruptions was introduced in 1989 by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before leaving the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where interruptions are forbidden.
Other are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women in prison who are sentenced to thirty years in prison for interruption of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything sacred?
Trump’s White House is now the Statue of Freedom.
The unfake sign of a regime change is the criticism of the statue.
The Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else – see the carefully inscenated collapse of the statue of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump’s regime, knew what he was going to when during a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the topic of presidential proposals to drastically limit legal immigrants, he went out with a symbolic sequel on the Statue of Freedom.
It is worth adding that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
It would be a crowd of travel ships owners and the imitators of the Statue of Freedom.
However, he attacked its importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a poster with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the basement, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
“I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... the symbol of American freedom, which throws light on the whole world.
The poem that has been added to the subparagraph and you refer to is not part of it.”
Miller is right, but as he said, this is not history.
Emmy Lazarus says, “Let the poor go to me, who falls, who is poor, who is hardly free to breathe, who is a poor worm in the midst of full cities.”
And just in modern times we can better than ever watch these “bad worms” on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict about the significance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who, after her death, sought to put a poster with a poem on the foundation of the statue, knew quite well that she was put into a high political game.
The statue should express the union of the French and American Republican government by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female character is not abstract, but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: The Mother of the Expellers.
The combination of the poem with the imagination of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American Nativism.
And in the same way Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing practitioners have long been trying to reverse this meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist in the matter of Trump's coming to power - in 2010 argued that the Statue of Freedom in fact doesn't lead anyone to the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing American flame to the behind-the-world: "The Statue of Freedom goes forward.
It brings the freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The West does not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Limbaugh strangely faces an important thing.
The importance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the sight of an exhausted and wicked passenger who often, after a long and terrible journey across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart to a new land.
It is literally a view of the world by the eyes of people seeking shelter and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and hears their needs.
And that’s, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump definitely recognize.
Their path is not to light the way, but to dissolve the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the times when the British team had only two Scottish members.
Director of the United Kingdom Athletic Federation Neil Black said the strong squadron of 16 Scots in the World Championship team would be “a huge contribution to the team.”
For the 2017 World Cup in London, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected.
Black believes that something special is happening in Scotland and British athletics could learn from Scots.
“We’re trying to understand and adapt it – we’re going to work on it,” Black said.
“I’ve talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s related to what they’ve done.
The representatives of the Scottish athletics think it has to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think that too.
Whatever it is, it’s amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will pursue a medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in a 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen to be the captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her first speech was amazing,” Black said.
“A number of athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with an enormous feeling of pride and motivation.
The passion and uncovered feelings with which Eilidh spoke were irrepetible.”
Commonwealth's silver medalist, who will compete in running over the obstacles at 400 m at her fifth World Championship, said it's "incredible" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record for 1983 and 2015 is 7.
The runner on the middle track, Muir, set only five British and two European records in the last year.
At the MS will participate in the 1500m and 5000m race.
Another great Scotch is Chris O'Hare, who will run the trail at 1500 m. This season he won the British Team Race and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, on which she was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team said she’s “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues came into the team, but in many cases they’ll at the same time attack to participate in the final and the medal.
“The extraordinary thing in the team’s captain’s position is that I was elected by the other members of the team.It was a great honor for me, but the awareness that I was elected by the members of the team is pleasant about it,” she added.
“I am very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It shows where I have moved.
They are athletes who will think of the top places on the stage.
What about my first speech?
Yes, I think it has succeeded.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year’s championship because it takes place on home ground.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and to rejoice the fact that we are back to the Olympic stadium.
I got a second chance to the race and I’ll enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t lose your public position if you don’t tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take a long time to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political opinions.
This criticism did not leave him cold.
He did not try to silence criticism.
Because in 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be removed from us – and the stupid and the fool will lead us like sheep to defeat.”
This brings me to Maryland with Governor Larry Hogan, whom he needs to work to begin to behave like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was charged by the American Civil Liberties Union this week.
The governor’s staff rejected the appeal as unfounded and in the comments on the internet appeared many opinions such as “who’s interested in it”.
“It’s just Facebook,” said many users.
However, it depends on it.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It is the second highest popularity among all 50 governors.
Hogan is not exciting.
As you can see, your state guides with certainty of its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It has also been shown to be skilled in using Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters – an exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a naked head after completing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who turn to the governor's page - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by its employees paid from the money of taxpayers - is useless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor with the fact that the blocking of comments was from the position of moderating posts.
However, to use the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post has confessed a few real people who have been deleted posts.
And that’s exactly what they are – real people who speak to their chosen leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were kind and attentive, not rough.
The pastor in his commentary quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi’s lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md. asked for hatred crimes, but her comment was not hatred.
“I honestly noted that I’m disappointed by his insufficient response to hatred crimes and other current news,” she wrote in a comment section to the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are described as promoting the so-called collective effort, instead of being recognised as a greater group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called “centralized spam interest” would other people probably call “defense”.
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of staff to the streets, where they would collect and burn all printings with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in the digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for the shame of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, according to the district judge James Cacheris, violated the first addition in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also waited for visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the times of Washington, the low price of the mail had practically the same impact as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the number of daily press quadrupled, and its leadership position was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even at that time, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms like “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius”, wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people under the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions gathered in his office criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
He did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and intimidation lies in the foundation of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, abroad they consume more data than at home.
In foreign countries, the Czechs consume more of their tariffs than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation they have more time to browse on the web, and under the sunlight they do not have the possibility of connecting to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of the operators there at domestic prices.
This is the result of O2’s recent statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, the majority of Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the roaming system than at home.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Croatia, where over the winter the minimum of ours runs, this summer data consumption has increased even fifty times.
Italy was on the second place in the consumed data ranking.
The majority of the minutes the Czechs are coming from Germany, where many of them go work during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech travel agencies, Croatia is the most popular holiday destination for 800,000 Czechs per year.
People here, however, exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
"There would be dozens of millions of photographs in the transferred data," said O2 mobile segment director Silvia Cieslar.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighboring countries.
The first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for a walking tourism and an active holiday, for which we don’t have so much time to browse the internet.
“Through Austria, the Czechs are going just to the Adriatic,” Cieslar explained.
While the data operator noticed high annual growth after the release of roaming fees, the growth in telephone is much lower.
The number of roaming minutes increased twice compared to last year.
Germany is dominating over the rest of the world.
“Roaming calls are used by corporate customers on work routes,” Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golf player Ronan Rafferty will hope for a comfortable atmosphere in the next three days at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative district of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course after his way to the final passed to Paul Eales. This year he will play the role of the tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve been watching the Renaissance Club slowly grow in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love the top quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an enthusiastic defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 years of career.
“I’m feeling good about it,” said the Southport golfist.
“I didn’t have the chance to defend my victory at Extremadura Open because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Return to this part of the world is magical.
This is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember the last year, when for me and my wife Sharon meant a win really a lot.
It was a wonderful time that I will not forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“I always like to play at home,” Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to be good and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really like to play again and I think I’m going well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.”
The three players will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Parking fee is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two and more passengers.
All the profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Country of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cookes dinner, she does not use a bakery.
In fact, it rarely uses the pan.
In her wooden chamber, which is located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato – in the speech of the local “notes” – directly into the fire.
After half an hour, the potato comes out and tastes it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a blatant land - the house is not equipped with furniture - where at the same time he performs his daily work, such as washing the clothes in the wiped water from the nearby moisture.
In a room without a roof, the bathroom is filled.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any fields for cultivation.
Polygamy is common.
Work until late night hours is a danger: most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
“After the afternoon after 5 a.m. no one will be allowed to travel around the village,” Bardina says.
It is a rare look into daily life on the heights of Papui, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elderly were forced to vote in the form of public hand lifting before the occupying army.
The present protesting movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a so distant and destroyed city to which you get after nine-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach swinging by driving.
Public transportation does not work.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo plots, roofs of wave sheets in shades of grey and scratched color.
There were very few Indonesians, journalists, and practically no foreigners looking at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped the god named Uga Tamee.
And that’s not all.
“We were not used to wearing these clothes,” says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-filled turban, dark shirt and bright dress.
We used to wear only leaves.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia – 28% of the population lives below the poverty limit and the child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in all of Asia.
It is also the gold country of Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province of approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015, Freeport produced gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the mining of wood for an estimated $78 billion.
This wealth, however, is a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid the local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden huse and are therefore hardly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuan people have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s were equal to a genocide, the Asian Commission for Human Rights said.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful Protestants were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, the 2016 Brisbane Archdiocese report describes the cruelty that happened last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to the further report is popular rape and electric execution - and the brutal oppression of peaceful protesters.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because the incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was stressed by the fact that the Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but demography changes with the flow of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan cantins sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with arachide sauce.
People are struggling for survival.
“The immigrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuan,” explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved for work to the capital of the province of Jayapura.
“The indigenous inhabitants of Papuy—mama-mama—thus lost their job.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, named Jokowi, in his 2014 presidential campaign promised a solution to inequality and rights violations.
The former thesar saved and his way to the presidential palace in the 27 of the 29 districts of Papui, including Paniai.
But in Papua this has changed very little and the local people feel trapped.
“Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he will hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after the October inauguration of Jakowi, Paniai experienced a big shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children singed a Christmas song at the camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle came out of the night.
Two of the surprising children told them they should turn the lights on.
One of the soldiers was touched by this excuse and tone, and later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a stressful state persecuted a group of children and shot them with their weapons, victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then shot a group of children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was shot so strongly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the nearby election commission building and the following day the things were still up.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command and demanded justice.
They came with the ceremonial hunting locks and performed the dance waita - which runs in a circle and imitates the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
A number of protesters started throwing stones into the buildings.
With increasing tensions, the soldiers were sent an order through the radio: “If the crowd tries at least three times for resistance, you have permission to shoot,” TIME said in an official document, whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighborhood, recognized the threat and called on the inhabitants to split into their homes.
But no one had neglected his words.
“When I turned, someone shot me into my left arm,” he told TIME on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame does not know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There was a lot of people around and a lot of people were shot,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
“I ran to the body to make sure it’s really him,” Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME.
“I saw him dead... I kissed him.”
Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only “providing” the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder was by the Jakart media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
“I ask for an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated,” he said.
In October 2016, National Security Minister Wiranto announced that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Soon, excuses began to be heard.
“Most of the violent acts have occurred for a long time.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I want to say that we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task,” he said.
However, in an interview on June 5 for the TIME weekly, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he does not plan to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be submitted to court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than a thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniai, have been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claims with uncertainty.
“In the last three years I have been questioned a total of four times, but so far I haven’t seen anything,” Yohanes said.
“I’m tired.”
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid that the army will arrest me or someone will kill me.”
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai who are afraid to talk about the incident.
He was killed by the army after he helped burial four of the victims.
“After the funeral, the army began to look for me,” he said.
The shooting continues.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shoot people in the neighboring village of Deiyai.
The strike, in which one person died and 17 others were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the building company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned during fishing in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The villagers protested in front of the building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones and responding to them was a warning shooting.
Local residents, however, claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) started shooting into the crowd and killed one man.
“There was a panic, we were afraid of repentance,” said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to the arrival of the injured.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyaisk parliament demanded the punishment of the involved police officers and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central altitudes.
Many of them joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebellion army that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. They include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has in recent years arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of the inhabitants of Paniai, all under the excuse of “assuring national sovereignty.”
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papuai as “a tragic and forgotten place.”
Oil is burning poverty.
That little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is unavailable.
The inhabitants here grow their foods: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them grows four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes are worth just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport has opened more air routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, economic inequality has grown between indigenous Papuan and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to start a business.
“Young people are moving from the villages because of the lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Council.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papua due to "unfavorable cooperation with the authorities", all despite the fact that they received so rare permits to film.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi in his election campaign promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and transparency and development.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebellionest eastern areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-accreditation of visas and entry into the blacklist,” the statement said.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that the international pressure on the Indonesian in the case of Papui is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Salomon Islands – appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Council for the investigation of “many and widespread violent acts” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, said: “In Indonesia, a democratic system is still in place and the media are free, so it’s hard to hide evidence of human rights violations.”
The local people call for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people spoke, according to a source, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want freedom".
In 2019, further elections are scheduled in Indonesia, but the Papuan claims they will not vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobau, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in a constant fear of the robbery army - are wrapped in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, consider their voice as a “duty” that Jokowi must pay.
“They don’t want money, they demand justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims, the panic shooting continues in the last symbolic act of resistance: they buried the bodies of the victims on the ground in front of the police and military station.
Being aware that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not let the responsible people forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head shaken.
“What can we do?”
The French Navy has captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy detained a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth approximately $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment went to Australia.
A four-member crew of the ship was arrested, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The Yacht, named Afalina, flew from South America and the police pulled it to a port in the city of Nouméa, a metropolitan of the French Overseas Territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Service said it will, in cooperation with its international partners, strive to determine exactly where and where drugs are going, and to uncover the “Lithuanian syndicate”.
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures to stop large amounts of drugs that go to Australia,” said CEO Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive destination for its traffickers due to high street drugs prices.
The country also faces the problem of increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
Nowadays, this is not the first time.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to pass through the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don’t feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem can be in homes for the elderly, the solution would, according to the doctor of the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlové, be infusions of a physiological solution, which are swallowed with a thin needle under the skin.
These are only applied in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"And in addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so the elderly generally receive less fluids and very quickly dehydrate," Mádlová said.
Two liters should be drunk.
“But getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem,” she added.
It is often said that no doctors are looking at it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
"I think that there too should be gradually introduced so that they can get subcutaneous infusions," she said.
For a day, up to two half-litre bottles of a physiological solution can be supplied to the elderly.
Lack of fluids can cause malaria, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is a total loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get up from bed, he's talking confusing," she added.
In case of negligence, it can lead to a stroke.
The blood is thick and the vases in the brain are stuck, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Sleeping patients should not be covered with a pear, a maximum of a cotton plate.
The problem can also be one-time plays.
“It’s more careful, but it’s ideal for the patient to occasionally discover and let the skin ventilate,” the doctor said.
The Torch Cloud for the second time burns in Dubai
In Dubai, on Friday, one of the world’s largest residential clouds was found in flames. firefighters had to evacuate all the inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79-storey buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire in this high building, which has the appropriate name The Torch (West).
All inhabitants of the building were evacuated and no injuries occurred.The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and the alarm awakened, we heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor,” Geroge, one of the residents of the cloud, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), continuing to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing replacement accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could again raise debate on the safety of materials used to cover height buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which began with the Torch Cloud Drive after the 2015 fire, showed that the most damaged was the cover and external panels used to decorate or isolate.
The British police said the isolation and covering system of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed 80 people.
The results of the survey show that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carry forbidden objects on board the aircraft.
A survey among passengers found that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously brought forbidden objects through the U.S. Government Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoint on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim that they delayed to find that they were traveling with firearms, munitions or explosives.
A survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – and answered by more than 1,000 respondents – found that younger passengers were more likely to infringe the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to travel consciously with an object that is prohibited by TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with a few thousand stained hours was compared to less than 15 percent of X-Generation members.
Among the most common items that escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents consciously expressed a sharp object through warning, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted that they intentionally threw forbidden drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it has conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried out unauthorized items through the airport check and how many did it deliberately.
It is no surprise that most people who have transferred unauthorized items — whether consciously or unconsciously — travel by aircraft very often.
As the company stressed, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don’t know what fluids and in what quantity they can carry into the aircraft.
Therefore, it is not surprising that TSA has captured the largest amount of prohibited fluids.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would deal with books in the same way as the trafficked goods.
Liquid transportation is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on the Delay of Planned Emission Reduction Directives by Obama Administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was charged by fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt revoked his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration’s carbon dioxide reduction plan.
Pruitt presented changes within his plan. He responds so more smoothly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal appeal against his previous position at the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last date set to 1 October when the states should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation on the reduction of ground ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who held the position of Oklahoma State Prosecutor General before he was president Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent to stricter environmental regulations.
Since his residence in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden Wednesday turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA executor had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the integration of the Obama administration plan that required diesel and gas companies to reduce methane leakings.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the commitment of the EPA to cooperate with the states through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within a given time framework.
“For the previous government, the EPA administration often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for it to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further setting plans,” said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen claims to the EPA.
“We don’t believe in regulation by means of judicial disputes and we take the deadline seriously.
We are never concerned about our status and the authority that arises from it.”
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may, at a certain point, use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulations “base on healthy policies and the most accessible information”.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider translation of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who was the leader of the coalition of the states that appealed the EPA this week said that the group did not intend to allow in legal pressure.
“The conversion in the opinions of the EPA – followed by our judgment – is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman added.
New York has joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
A ground ozon occurs when the usual harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are grateful to Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s worrying what pressure should be developed to change the thinking of the responsible people and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biodiversity.
“We must continue to fight with the ideological drive of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests.”
He polished the man with acid, but it was not dangerous according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one moment you’re home with your family and you laugh, at the other you’re suddenly changing your whole life from the foundation.
And the worst thing is that you can’t do anything with it.
A similar fate encountered Andreas Christopher from the UK, whose face was filled with acid by an unknown attacker, who was eventually released from guilt.
The information was by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone at Christopher's was knocking at the door.
Andreas said he was going to open.
He thought that behind the door was probably a courier who had to deliver that day Christmas gifts for the family.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man who never saw him in his life, immediately after opening without warning, filled him with acid with the words: "This is for you, friend."
The pain was untold.
The clothes broke up on me as nothing and I only felt an incredible pain on my skin,” Andreas said.
The family quickly transported him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned a terrible news - according to the doctors he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Nine percent were affected by the face, which the doctors tried to put together with the skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of the eyelids.
This is probably the most painful thing I’ve experienced.
"You can't hide yourself from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today, Christopher has twelve operations, which are far from the last.
The injuries that suffer the victims of acid attacks, according to plastic surgeons, may require hundreds of surgical interventions and years of treatment.
Even after a challenging and long-term treatment, the victims have wounded tissues to the end of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and fight deformation and deformation throughout their lives,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopher is sure that an unknown man had to confuse him with someone.
The murderer believed he was revenge to a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the case and later found the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the surprise of Christopher's family changed substantially.
"Three judges eventually came to the conclusion that the punishment should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks with grapes has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Internal Affairs said that it intends to provide new guidelines to the prosecutors regarding the classification of grapes.
They should be classified among dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks do not give up.
They demand the UK government to impose stricter and longer prison punishments on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other grain.
They also require strict controls of the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous cloud-drop The Torch, which belongs to the largest housing buildings in the world, burned in the night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the eighty-floor building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
A spokesman said the fire exploded on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to a few inhabitants, it was the opposite.
“It started at the 67th floor, this is how they told us,” said one of the renters.
Also, according to another tenant, which was quoted by Reuters, the fire exploded in the highest floors and spread down with falling burning ruins.
We slept.
We woke up, people screamed.
“We ran down the stairs, it took us from the 50th floor about ten minutes,” George described the event.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the fires caught about 40 apartments.
On the ground the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to civil defence reports, the fire was under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the current has fallen in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire damaged the Dubai Cloud Drop The Torch also in February 2015, destroying more than a hundred apartments.
There are approximately 680 apartments in the building.
At that time, nothing happened to anyone because they managed to evacuate the residents in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and became the world's highest residential building with its 352 meters.
The record was recorded by another Dubai cloud crash next year.
A bodybuilder had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He did not win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, the sample of the twenty-three-year-old Ippolita contained a diverse collection of illegal drugs – from steroids through diuretics to drugs for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix did not help him to the title, he ended fourth.
The bodybuilder is now under threat of four years distance and criminal proceedings.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian rabbist Davide Vasta was positively tested on 11 doping substances, which was until then a record number in the athletes found.
The trillion player began, according to his words, to take steroids a year before he fell bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged herself with her ex-lover.
Lucka Vondráčková hardly entered the territory of the Czech Republic, is in one round.
It also draws attention wherever it comes.
The last time she fell in her arms was her former lover, Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years old and had a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old and definitely didn’t want to hang her career on a nail.
They went away, but friends remained until today.
This was also done at a press conference on TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
The two coincided in a blue color.
First they didn’t notice themselves, but then they approached, and Lucie laughed at Michal’s jokes, until she got in her stomach.
Then they hugged themselves and placed the photographers willingly.
Their encounters, however, were not a coincidence, they will play together a loving couple in the new series Primy Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life in Britain for preparing the attack.
The British court sent four members of the Islamist cell, called Three Musketeers, to life imprisonment on Thursday, according to the prosecutor's report, planning a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested in August last year.
The authorities believed they were going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, a knife with the inscriptions that in Arabic mean "non-believers" and a macet of a gun.
This happened when a MI5 agent placed a hearing device in the car.
“Recent assassinations have shown what horror the accused could cause if they were not stopped,” prosecutor Sue Hemming said.
Three prisoners aged 28, 25 and 33 years may apply for release after twenty years.
The fourth convicted, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years in prison.
During the London trial, men claimed they were innocent and the weapons found in the car were placed there by the MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the allegations of the accused.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
It was 38.3 °C in Hodonínsk.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnica na Hodonínsk, it was overcome on Thursday, which became the hottest day to date this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Unfortunately, there were not many temperatures recorded on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations over the past 30 years were recorded.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measurement stations recorded temperatures.
The temperature on Thursday was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednica on Břeclavsk of Thursday 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four decades and in Pohořelice on Brněnsk of the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three decades.
Both records, as well as the Guardian, came from 2013.
It was 10 degrees less in the west.
High temperatures occurred on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnica, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice on Znojemsk and Brodě nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the contrary, for example, in the western and northwestern Czech Republic, the highest temperatures on Thursday were just around 22 degrees Celsius.
“Temperatures began to rise until this afternoon,” the meteorologists said.
The current rainfall in the Czech Republic will gradually decline and more significant rainfall could come on Sunday.
In most areas of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in Southeast Moravia and on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions of dollars due to visa policy.
China has been trying to exercise its influence for decades without the use of force.
Every year, it will spend $10 billion in supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and seeking to attract Western tourists.
Beijing does not do that.
The state media is talking about the plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals last year increased by only 3.8 percent and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is caused, among other things, by the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners just with open arms, assesses the situation in the world’s most populated country Professor of Economics at the University of Beijing Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
The example that speaks for everything is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a visa-free relationship with China, while citizens of the other countries have to make a visa in advance.
Therefore, the crowds in the U.S. officials are comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait for it for long hours on the front, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic obstacles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s GDP and lives there less than one percent of the total population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem by itself when tourism is used to its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring restricted transport to South Korea as part of a breakdown around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits decreased by 42 percent per year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
This affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the U.S. Central Bank (Fed), China could leave up to $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign trips, while China will earn about $35 billion a year as part of the sale of currency to arrival tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the payment balance, China last year had a tourism deficit of $217 billion, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s total surplus in goods trade.
Therefore, a small number of tourists in the country, which is anxiously preventing the flow of capital, puts a very painful wound.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general retention to foreigners.
There are many places in China where no one has heard of immigrants.
More than a million foreigners lived in China in 2013.
There are several different cities in the United States.
Japan, which is not just the crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific studies show that immigrants normally revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find them.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have recently made a lot of effort to simplify and simplify the visa proceedings.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Zoo of Plzeň, deadly poisoned plays were multiplied.
The Plymouth Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the little ones of three rare, deadly poisoned plays.
In the exhibition, visitors will only see all nine newborn Turkish serpents.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at a height of 2,000 meters.
“It also grows a meter length,” said Zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The youth of the other two species, the mortal and the cobra red, for now will gain strength in the grocery background of the garden.
We can’t say when people will see them.
“We don’t want to lose them,” said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australia's deadly elephants came to the world eight, they are descendants of a breeding pair originating from a population around Sydney.
"The unit that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals from the surrounding area of Perth," Vobruba said, saying that in human care it is necessary for the mortals to winter 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by the snush of the African floating cobra red.
A couple in the Plzeň Zoo had a total of four eggs.
“The incubation lasted 65 days,” Vobruba added.
This species in nature on its victims spreads poison, up to a distance of up to four meters.
It goes to the eyes and can cause permanent blindness.
Children of all three species are fed by mouse holats in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect the leakage of young men from the snorkel of mamba black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to the unconfirmed translation of the telephone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico because of paying for the border wall
The U.S. newspaper Washington Post has published a replica of President Trump’s telephone calls with Mexican and Australian leaders.
In a telephone conversation on January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he will not pay for the proposed building of the wall.
The US president accused him of publicly condemning the building of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t speak this way in the press.”
In his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico will pay for it.
The first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull revealed a tensionful exchange of opinions.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. Supervision Agreement on Refugees Going to Australia is “smiling” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement – which came up during President Obama’s government – he would look like “drogated” after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump ended the conversation after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk again spoke to the prosecutor's office for Smolensk.
"He has something to be afraid," said the brother of the dead president, the chairman of the government party Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to worry, Kaczyński will not catch me," Tusk replied and read to the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When leaving the headquarters of the prosecutor's office, a crowd waited for Tuska, according to TVN 24, who scandalized Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a pure conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński won't catch me."
According to his words, he does not blame the prosecutors for anything, but he does not doubt that justice has to serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, opposition or people they don’t like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was in interrogation for the second time.
The former prime minister has been interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time it was to be interrogated on mistakes in the pitvages of the victims of the smolensk catastrophe.
In addition, the bodies were confused in the roofs.
Families were forbidden to open the cage and there had to be some reasons to do so.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden the Polish-Russian relations.
“Staying good relations at any cost, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU,” Kaczyński said at the Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that the event of a conflict with Russia would destroy Tusk's chances of obtaining the most important seat in the Union, which Poland does not have anything from.
Kaczynski also said he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but did not take it into account.
Tusk has undergone an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor’s office on April 19.
He did not declare as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many viewed his call to an interrogation as part of the obvious attempt of the Polish government and Chief PiS Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking to various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor's Office is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who plays the role of the General Prosecutor.
The call to an interrogation came shortly after Tuska was elected to be the head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried to prevent effortlessly but uselessly, among other things during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová held a single protest.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw on hairstyles.
Myanmar and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to re-vote the composition of the parliament from Myanmar, Senegal and Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This is based on a regulation that regulates the delivery of voting tickets abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update and is currently in the comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for members abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry justifies its progress.
"In some countries new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the material writes.
The Decree contains two annexes, the first of which indicates the representative authorities to which paper voting cards are delivered.
This group of authorities includes representations of the Czech Republic in neighboring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a voting card in a press version.
It is their list that changes with the decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
The two ambassades are closed.
The Czech Republic has also canceled its representation in Malaysia’s Bamako and Japan’s Kyoto.
He will not be elected at the Donetsk Consulate.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
The new ones are on the list of embassy in Kenya’s Nairobi, Senegal’s capital Dakar and Zambia’s Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation to the general consulate in Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'chuan.
Voting tickets will also be available to registered voters at the Czech Embassy in Myanmar and Cambodia.
The Czechs in the foreign country had the opportunity to elect their members in the electoral rooms at representative offices or consulates for four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission will determine the country for which the candidates are voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002, when the South Moravia candidates were elected.
In the following two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Czech candidates.
In 2013 the Central District was selected as this year.
The number of voters abroad is increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago approximately 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6700, four years later 8222.
10,571 voters arrived at the parliamentary elections four years ago.
Massacre on Moore's Ford Bridge: Activists Remember Racist Lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed around the observing residents of Monroe, Georgia and codrcal towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before the car with four black-blind passengers and a white driver was enough to arrive at the bridge, a group of white people with weapons gave the road to him.
The group's leader - a middle-age man in a striped dress - long pulled out of the cigarette and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside the passengers trembled with fear.
“We want that n—and Roger!” the man screamed.
“Let me bring it!”
The silence interrupts the scream of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger's seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men crosses the “Roger’s” neck, the audience will breathe with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists regularly returns to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct that fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has yet been convicted of murder.
“It’s surprising that in all those years no one person has been arrested – even though we’re still seeing them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps restore the event to organize.
“It’s a spot on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of Georgia and a lifelong warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to take place. Every year, the city community of Monroe reminds that justice was not done enough.
“We demand prosecution and the conclusion of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
“From that time, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be started.”
On July 27, 1946, a court doctor covered one of the bodies of a lynching victim at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI records received by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were expected to take part in the lynching.
No one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the suspects being released for decades, civil rights defenders claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - have been known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court, the inhabitants of the black state of Georgia obtained the right to participate in the summer elections for the first time.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the black-weather farmer Roger Malcom had during the struggle pointed the land owner of white-weather Barnet Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brookse, it was traded that Hester lived with Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her to a different state.
According to a statement by the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then major owner of white leather land Loy Harrison submitted a $600 guarantee for Malcoma.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and his brothers, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When they returned from the prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects took their way.
“As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison,” the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officials, who not only participated in the lynching but also deprived of evidence and hidden the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks stated the whole matter more briefly.
“It was a massacre for the right to vote,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all local black people: ‘This is how you’ll happen if you register and go to vote.’”
The Moore’s Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost 10 years.
It shows a deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and even more difficult is to reverse the sight, but Greene says it has its meaning.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you hear what I had to go through.”
The main tests of this year’s reconstruction began in June and on the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen white men, the rest black men – entered the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh serves as assistant director.
He has been the leader of Kukluxklanu for many years, but according to his words, the role is exhaustive.
“I feel bad because it is contrary to who I am,” Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to come back to such a time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, namely Barnet Hester, practice their roles.
The show begins with a struggle - Malcom has a dispute with Hester and blames him for being asleep with his wife.
“Take out of my land n--e!”
Rascone is not possible.
There is a conflict.
At that moment everyone (at least every actor of black leather) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
“What’s happening?” asked Rascona.
He is confused.
Was I too brutal?
“No,” Greene said gladly.
“I just don’t think that the white people said ‘n-r’ in such a tone.”
“That’s exactly,” one of the black-held actors hang out.
“You have to put more emphasis on R.”
Energy in the room is suddenly better; enemy will replace the feeling of approaching.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Just for it to be made for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time puts the emphasis on the correct pronunciation of the word to N.
No one laughs anymore.
The show ends quickly and violently.
The shoot, the shoot and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the actors' bodies and sings Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is a feeling of sadness in the room.
On the background of all this, about a dozen observers throw sweat and tears out of their eyes.
There are almost the same numbers of black and white people.
One couple arrived from New York’s Ithacy, many viewers are from the nearby area.
Each of them tolerates the local wet climate for eight hours and Brooks leads them in the crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment the murder could have been seen with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching occurred, the atmosphere is terrible.
With the last words of the song, Greene calls the crowd of observers to inspect the bodies.
Children cling to the heads of the victims, watch false blood and immobile bodies, and scream something into their ears.
“They’re not dead,” the little boy tightened.
It will take a few minutes and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the thread and clean their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugha, a man in the dress that played the leader of the Kukluxklana.
Nick Rascona embraces his two friends-actors and cries in their arms; in the end, his emotions fall on him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women shouted.
“We know that the role is in place.
You had a reason for that.”
On the same day, the audience met with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is interested in talking about the show with a black couple, with whom they met today.
Denise Duplinski hardly found words to express her feelings from today's show.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and to look at those ugly acts... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said to the reconstruction.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a current topic,” she added, “it’s just called police struggles.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the court hall, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
He said he had planned the show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to experience – but it is at the same time a moment to think,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who don’t know and don’t study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions to use read only the srab.
I disagree, the opposite.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times of the long past, where the instructions to use anything were a rather rare indication.
So for example, my first gramofon contained only one paper, on which there were hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, with all some secret marks.
When something went wrong within me after years, I offered that list to the Shaman, who was not afraid to scroll the rear plate.
He told me what the labyrinth paper is suitable for.
Yes, it was a usual help with chronic toilet paper depletion.
He found a broken wire and allowed me to listen again to the expensive vinyl plates.
The new time has brought new guidelines.
Even a relatively simple fruit refiner, where it simply kept the overwhelmed grep, required about ten images.
Particularly successful was a draft with a description of how to put one part into the other.
The set was two-party and another procedure was simply not possible.
Giving it vice versa requires considerable effort with the need to remove certain plastic components.
My neglect of the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-moving.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with a guide to small repairs, among which included, among other things, the exchange of the blink lamp.
It was simple.
Three steps and the work was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the guide forgot to mention that while the lamp right went to replace really in just three steps.
Separate the cover.
Write the broken lamp and write the new.
3. to cover the cover.
The lamp on the left had a problem in the form of placing the battery cover.
At first I thought that by putting the right upper end into the car's body, I'm putting a slurry, a slurry, by which the cover was easily removed, and then I'm going to run the points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
Failure of lava.
The cover had no place, no space, even for the thin hand of the Grape, even the obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The state was still strengthened by the entrance of my wife to the garage, which was called by the righteous and the words that from my mouth hear quite exceptional.
“What are you doing here?” she asked unhappyly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss vulgar terms, only two published words remained.
I change the lamp.
“And why does it take you so long?” she raised the phrase, which in a long-lasting bond may be her last.
I slowly explained her the problem, with the main emphasis on the process of torture by the author of the instructions, where the blessing with burned iron on the hand, which wrote the instructions, then by her throw, so that she could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to the wide range of the instructions of Kladiva on the witch, including his commissional burning on the top of the Losin Castle.
“What do you do to remove the box?” the woman thought to remove the battery.
In pure despair this happened and then the step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that until the day that a colleague called me, who was just talking about the collapse after the check of two officials of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a colleague of a balanced, who in the field experienced the possible and the impossible, and who knows how to interpret the wild stories with an uninterrupted voice.
“I think I’ve got a fine because I don’t have a handwashing instructions,” he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually pulled out of it all the problem, which was that above the washing machine in the patient’s toilet there was no picture guide to how to wash the hands.
His argumentation to the commission official that adults can wash their hands, as a rule, and that it does not need pictograms to manage the usual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him little money.
“It’s not just so,” she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of the wiped hands with flowing water is a primitive act at the level of the Chronicles that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to tell you that it is necessary to get water out of the cottage.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end there is a pleasant discovery that a man was washed his hands exactly as it is ordered by the host of the SUCL.
Finally, I have to point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activities in the toilet.
In the matter of defection, the procedure is uniform, there the problem does not arise, with urination, due to certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to hang the instructions two.
The problem remains those piktograms, because creating a perfect procedure means even a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which could raise some anger in the prudent toilet visitor, in spite of the fact that he can finally learn that he has scratched the respective hole throughout his life by a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson will dismiss more than 3,000 employees and reduce its dividends to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will dismiss another 3,000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 percent in response to a further restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of dismissal, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to dismiss 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by another £300 million (394 million dollars) in May as part of the third cost-reduction program in an effort to revive the falling trade as a result of the sharp development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its share in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a cabin in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
A suicide terrorist attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, where one NATO soldier was killed and several others were injured, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to informal reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the city district of Qarabagh.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed in the explosion in the Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO said the explosion took place on Tuesday after the patrols and members of the Afghan army were attacked by “a local person with a home-made explosive equipment.”
The statement also stated that all the wounded soldiers are out of life threat and are located in the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram air base.
According to reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb placed in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban attacked.
This is the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops collapse the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already so doubtful situation in Afghanistan and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. soldiers to help military units and police in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks, which he has trained in recent weeks, have shocked the public’s confidence in the government, its regulations and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the complaint, the EPA reviewed its decision to delay the rules of smoking
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration law that ordered the states to reduce emissions, just a day after the agency was charged by 15 states.
The EPA on Wednesday night announced its decision to submit the “Ozone Standards 2015” with the words that it submits the agency’s commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will hear their opinions,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June announced the EPA's effort to delay the ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of measurements determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday with the grounds that the EPA talks were illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump strives to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama – according to Trump’s words in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups, which are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA reports on its website that ozon-containing air breathing “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár was wounded and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event on the Czech circumstances, on which he hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and a number of others, and the event was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show themselves to the public and to present their music video to the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by just named personalities.
Few people already know that the recording of the video clip in Russia did not go without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big filming with the stars of the Russian national ballet and did not run without a fair trapas.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the singer's juice had to indicate a facky blow in the video clip.
At one point, he hit him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a morning, I didn't expect it, my nose immediately dropped blood," Ladislav commented on the situation.
The colleagues and producers told the situation on the place that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav failed to respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious to affect the continuation of the next filming.
The mentioned video clip of the young artist now we bring you, you can record in it the scene with a hit.
Unbeated version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko talked on the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasil Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could scan the most stressful boxing match in lightweight, met for the first time on Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the unbeatable lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council - did not go down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomachenka, the pearweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garci's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, both boxers got on the list of the five best lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How is it, champion?
Good luck.”
Lomachenko defends on Saturday at 19: 00 his title against Miguel Marriago at ESPN.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential match of the boxers would be a “perfect test.”
“I’m a former champion in pear weight,” Garcia adds.
“Because of the match with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain, but I’m not so big.
At my 63 kg I am small.
I want to go back to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to get back to get on a lightweight... then we can fight.
That is what fans want.
Why not fulfill it.”
Lomachenko agree.
This match would be good for the boxer.”
Lomachenko should complete his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in a match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who compete on September 23 for a lightweight title in the Forum arena.
“The match should take place in a way of paying for viewing, that’s what fans ask,” Garcia said, who later said it was open to the possibility of broadcasting the match through a TV station that will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will attract such attention.
We are waiting for the right opportunity.”
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as a “wonderful boxer” and could participate in his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, did not give Garci's praise to scratch when he said the Riverside three-division champion looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said that his goal was to show strength and only then box.
Both boxers said they felt an increasing tension before each other's duel.
You will not forget this match.
No other game will draw so much attention.
And I’m very pleased to put it in the fire,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I was waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey.”
It will be a great match.”
The couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found on the bottom of Volga.
A couple of young Russians, Ilya Žirnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search, but without success.
The police ended the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what happened to the couple.
Twelve years later, the whole story came to a sad end.
The wind of their car was found by a laic dyker at the bottom of the Volha River in the city of Čeboksary in Čuvašsk.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived underwater for a decade, without them the police would take much longer to find the identity of the found.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to get his girlfriend out of work.
The driver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
His find was by the Ceboksar police, which the following day pulled the car to the beach.
Investigators believe that the death of the young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, and further details will be published after its completion.
The latest results of the tests to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that more than 80 percent of people were questioned as older than 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) has launched new tests earlier this year.
The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lie about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as over 18 years old, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency found that the questioned was “maybe over 18 years old.”
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the questioned was “probably under 18 years of age”.
Tests shall be accessed only if the age of the questioned person is disputed.
According to John GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“In comparison to last month, the statistics remain in captured routes and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age is estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the applicants are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that “the respondent is 18 years old or older.”
The Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 this year.
Criticism was also attended by the medical age determination method, which includes the X-ray of wisdom’s teeth and the MRI scan of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and X-ray scientists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, who is among other things engaged in evaluating the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person passed puberty.
“I had a reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is in a certain sense very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age with accuracy, we should not pretend the opposite,” he told Metro.
Forensic medical agency Agency’s GÃ¶ransson defended the decision by saying: “In general, it can be said that the risk of an incorrect assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just below the age limit of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.”
Trump threatened the Mexican president by telephone.
U.S. President Donald Trump in a January telephone call to Mexican President Enric Peña Nieto threatened he would not meet him if he would publicly say his country will not pay for the construction of the US-Mexico wall.
Trump said in an interview that the financing would be arranged somehow, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump has spoken openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
The report was published on Thursday by the US newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last year’s election campaign.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump's resignation, Mr. Peña Nieta was undiplomatically punished for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government will never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in an interview on January 27 and threatened by interrupting contacts with the Mexican president if he will continue to issue oppressive statements.
Financing is going to be done and it will be done well.
“But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I don’t want to contact you, gentlemen, because it’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall is the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is the most important thing.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after he took power.
Mexico has rejected the construction and financing of a 3,200-kilometre wall, which has led to a deepening of the relations between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said the project will still be applied to the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also about Trump’s telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The head of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
The conclusion was made by the exchange of opinions on the agreement that Australia will provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the U.S. receiving persons from internation facilities in the Pacific Islands.
Trump first considered the deal stupid, but later approached it.
“You can definitely say that this is not the agreement you’ve made, but you’ll have to keep it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated Australian refusal to receive refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
“You’re worse than me,” Trump laughed.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation was sharpened.
“I hate accepting these people,” Trump said.
I assure you they are bad.
So they are now in prison.
“They will not be great people who will go to work for local dairy workers,” he said.
In the interview he also said that a refugee could become a Boston terrorist in five years.
In late January, about a week after he arrived in the White House, Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world officials, often even several in one day.
The conversation with Turnbull eventually described as the least pleasant one for the whole day.
Before ending it, he emphasized that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
The murderer was executed in front of the crowd.
Her father also watched.
The murder was carried out on the square in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to the house of her father, where he rape her and scratched her with naked hands.
He also raped her body, which he then comforted near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl hit the whole country facing the threat of a civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of the thousands of people who gathered together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was sentenced under the sharia law.
The father of the victim told the media his feelings.
I feel like a rebirth.
I relaxed.
It is a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were also present, with the crowd screaming the slogan "Let Justice Live".
The victim was brought to the square by a police truck from which he was pulled out.
Police put him on the stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and launched a fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every wound that was burned.
Mr al Almatari said the site MailOnline that justice was carried out in accordance with the legal system of the country.
“Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won,” he added.
I stood on the Square of Liberation in San and waited for the execution of the murderer of my daughter.
Then I and my family went to the marble.
We took Ranino's small body and buried him in the nearby cemetery.
I and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been performed.
Police were afraid that the crowd gathered on the square would fall into hatred madness, the murderer would fall and fall.
The execution was ordered by a court, which is under the administration of the Shiite Huthi.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds by a beat immediately after his arrest, but his act raised such an anger that the judge decided for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Ranina’s family knew him well.
When the police were searching for the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could be his motivation?
Even the animal would be more mercyful to the morning.
“Our family has no enemies and the injury that brought Ranino’s body was terrible,” he told the media.
“The wound disappeared in the afternoon, yet that day we it to the police, we told the newspapers and all of our television stations, the posters with her photo hanged everywhere,” he continued.
Everyone believes that the police got a tip from the murderer parents who suspected their son of the horrifying act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
She walked out to play with other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where it was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the cars and walked around, but we searched for us in vain.
The Yemeni inhabitants were disappointed by the crime and began to gather before the police station where Al Maghrabi was held and demand an immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to the crowd present to calm them.
The accused did not regret his act.
Just before he was sentenced, the police read his sentence, but the convicted only looked at his executor.
The whole event was filmed for the national television, but on the internet appeared a lot of records taken by the crowd.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of political party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice on Thursday evening announced at Trump’s meeting that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their back to me,” Justice Governor said.
“Today, after a long prayer and thought, I am telling you ... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor.”
The audience exploded in joy.
“I’m going to sign up to the Republicans tomorrow,” the Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you that it’s time to jump into another match.”
Trump has previously promised a significant announcement to the people at the assembly in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a great property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening issued a statement in which it stated: “The departure of the Governor of Justice is another blow for the Democratic Party, which puts obstacles to our way instead of contributing to the lifting of our country.”
“For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and has the least legislative authorities in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is the last drop for an already so wicked party without a leader who is desperately trying to find a positive and unifying news,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises "right" apology from Russia for doping scandal
Former excellent athlete Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday Russia for sincere apologies for the doping scandal, but repeated that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sport world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place in the eve of the World Cup in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted for the preservation of the ban, which entered into force in November 2015, after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
“I think we’ve been witnessing very honest answers and presentations today,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working with all its strength to repair and restore the proper function of the entire Federation.”
Coe said he was also “rejoiced” that Russia adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today was very successful and we’ve moved to the next stage, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to preserve the punishment that was thrown on Russia,” Coe added.
“In the coming months, we have to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
“Our effort was always to separate honest athletes from the unfair athletes,” he ended his speech.
At the World Cup in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have met the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF Crisis Staff Chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it will be accepted back.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still inadequate and excluded coaches continue to operate their activities, he told reporters in London after the IAAF council presentation ended.
The state contract of CzechTrade was obtained by the company Františka Savova, whose state is prosecuting.
The public procurement of the state proexport agency CzechTrade was obtained by the publisher Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
The officials awarded him 100 percent points in all quality criteria.
The Czech state prosecutes Savov for tax fraud and requires his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade signed a four-year public procurement for the editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal in April.
The contract in the total value of SEK 30.8 million was obtained by the publisher Mladá fronta entrepreneur Františka Savova.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and prosecuted him for escape.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was by the server.
According to the original criteria, the CzechTrade had to decide on the 60 percent of the offered price and the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion has helped Savov’s company significantly.
According to the data, it received 100 points in all quality criteria.
It was the result that she moved to another candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing company, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a monthly amount of 404,900 SEK, VLM offered 324,350 SEK.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it obtained a sub-mediate rating of 62 points from the assessors in all quality criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Aktually.cz under the publishing company Economia.
The VLM issued several objections against the tender result with the fact that its assessment is considered unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their refusal, the competition was decided to appeal to the Competition Protection Authority of the UOHS.
It is believed that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
“The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the public procurement provider on the basis of a pure subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers,” the proposal for the opening of the proceedings submitted to the UOHS this week, which was published by the server Aktuálně.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the VLM, Michal Klimy, the selection committee’s score appears to be unreliable and a hundred percent assessment of the Young Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
“Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious,” he said.
CzechTrade has not yet expressed the situation.
CzechTrade is essentially not commenting on public procurement before it is concluded.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in the Advertiser Profile and in the Public Procurement List in accordance with the law.
"After the termination of the contract, a complete written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express its course," said the media representative of the agency Štěpán Dlouhý.
The Young Front responded with a statement, according to which it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing company Economia has interfered with an article in Aktually.cz in a competition where it has its own commercial interests.
However, this fact was stated in the aforementioned article.
In the tender, it could help her that she was providing BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was awarded for the first time in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Cuba ODS.
Františka Savova accuses the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, causing the Czech state a alleged damage of up to 770 million kronor.
The Czech Republic has requested the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, behind his criminalization stands the head of the ANO movement Andrej Babiš, under whose influence falls the Mafra publishing company.
The London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition last year, but the entrepreneur appealed.
"In our view, the case has not gone anywhere since last year, from the UK we have not received any information in the matter of acquiring legal power of the judgment until today," said the spokesman of the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the Mladé front, Savov appeared in the Harvestor Limited company based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson beer factory, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which profiles as an investment fund, purchasing endangered assets.
Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, has a debt of over $3 billion.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist walked through the roads and the park, and ended in the roads.
The motorcycle driver attracted attention with a careless ride on the streets, walks and parks in Úšovice.
When the guard began to pursue him, he decided to take her in the direction of the Station.
“Policists with increased caution persecuted the city when on one of the side roads behind the Marian Baths he failed to drive and with a motorcycle entered the field where he crashed,” police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
A rescue helicopter, which transported the wounded motorcycle driver to the Plzeň hospital, had to arrive at the accident.
The police later found that the motorist did not own a driver’s license, the motorcycle registration labels were stolen, his production number broken out and the production label itself was removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breathing test was conducted and the driver's alcohol presence was excluded on the site, but the test found a positive result on the substance metamfetamine," the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not interfere with Neymar's record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalties for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules that UEFA introduced in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros for Neymar's contract and Neymar will demand a wage of a few tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a rich Qatar family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar to the already so star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the management costs of football-related business activities.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he reached the chairman of the UEFA in 2007.
An ex-French player believed that the clubs that are in the pursuit of new strengths will ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners refuse to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected their attention from club debts to monitor their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent horent amounts for players y to build a global brand - suddenly was not so profitable.
In the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs may report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the ban on excess spending.
“FFP rules continue to apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” said last week to Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who supervises compliance with FFP rules.
Although PSG has paid the amount for Neymar's redemption in a single payment, it may, for accounting purposes, allocate the amount to the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken up to €44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of FFP’s highest sanctions hit the PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which owns the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG sent a fine of EUR 60 million (82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that may try to escape financial regulators by increasing their revenue through clubs associated companies.
Thus, although the Qatar company sponsors PSG once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by the UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar’s income in the PSG could be paid by the organizational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
PSG and Qatar’s 2022 World Cup leaders, however, denied that Neymat should become the World Cup ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that the UEFA will carefully monitor any attempt to overcome the rules.
According to Tuesday, UEFA has not launched any investigation on Neymar’s transfer to the PSG.
The source of the report wanted to remain anonymous because he was not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, the Associated Press said.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed the 2015-2016 year with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of dresses.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30%.
The representatives of the Spanish League, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the greatest stars, sought to disturb Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG will violate the FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ of the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Teba told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG by the Qatar Syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same attitude of La Liga about the club’s financing.
“It’s the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club becomes the owner of the state, everything is possible.
Respecting the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club.”
Spartan Deputy Rosicki: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
A total of 16,000 fans are on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický goes to the square.
The same scene as in the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
The Sparta's backpacker sparked the game against the Red Star, invented several goals, but his co-players did not target the black.
The flight team, pumped with new multi-million strengths, ends after the introduction double in the European Cups.
Was it hard to do something after the match in Belgrade?
After the incased goal, we had to shoot four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted at least not to lose, to raise our self-confidence, so that we had something to reflect on to the next match.
We had some chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why did Sparta not get into the game so long?
The game is terribly processed.
The combination of opponents was much better than our.
We didn’t do anything, we shot once in half a time.
This is, of course, very little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was a lot better, and in the final third we were able to play with them.
But you have to push the opponents more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the set?
Of course, this is one of the pain when a new team is formed.
We have only played three matches and the composition is still changing.
The goal is that the coach finds the ideal 11th one to sit.
Is it an encouragement for you to have played a part of two matches in a row?
These are just parts of the game.
I don’t know how my state will evolve and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have occurred in Sparta?
We must be, otherwise it is not possible.
It is the same as injury.
If you don’t believe, you can’t return.
Sparta has somehow decided, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in a large number, but left in disappointment.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just as with Bohemka.
I am very sorry that we can’t make them happy with better performance.
Show something for which they will come next time.
We can thank them for arriving.
I don’t remember such a visit when I played here 15 years ago.
Can the season without the cup be at least an advantage for the league?
We are struggling with ourselves, we are struggling with ourselves, so this is not an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur has to sit down for 10 years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of the entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for reducing taxes.
The damages are estimated at 645 million.
Toman in the complaint claimed that justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said incomplete.
The constitutional judges, however, described the complaint as unfounded, the CTK found out from the court’s database.
It is not another appeal court.
“The fourth instance cannot judge the fact or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of the constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,” the resolution states.
Toman was judged as a refugee.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where he was according to the resolution at the time of the US decision.
The penalty is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as the chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
A total of SEK 645 million was created only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leak, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
However, for legal reasons it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the whole amount.
According to the accusation, World Servis did not include all the invoices in its tax declarations.
Instead of monthly VAT and consumer taxes in orders of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomir Vybíral, who was sentenced by the court to 13 years in prison for VAT machinery in fuel stores.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
The series "Flight to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic thread
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for the characters of the famous 80s; and for the dirty 90s (when the genius David Wain and Michael Showalter presented the MTV comedy sketch “The State”); and of course for the modern time, namely the year 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd spread to bigger projects.
As a cultural artefact, it is a light parody and, at the same time, the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the perspective of the franchise, it seems that someone has a breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to the absurd humor (a example can be the story of the formation of a speaking sheet with vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin told).
The authors turned away from the main funny point - middle-age actors who play teenage narrated children - and could not throw away from the previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults, does not push so much on the emotional level and the satira is places to sporadic, including a parody on the 90s thrillers like "The Hand on the Collector".
At one point, the character finds on a crowd of Apple Powerbooks, wheels and “a lot of other things from 1991.”
Many major stories are repeated.
The charitable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has not yet moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still in panic.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
Especially fun is to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respectful character Andy is now behind the old paprika.
Francis could be initiated by moments of random madness, such as the backward series “Seven Up”, until it reaches what I suppose will be a logical resolution: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” when in the last scene the whole group will run for the premiere of “Year to Survive”.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, in the meantime, appeals to a different type of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of the series "Takovny Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: Without Prayer" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes collide.
A comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanak directed by Rhyse Thomas is to act as a television show: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s fighting for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the robust Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which were introduced to the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
In some jokes you laugh (such as police watching chess on television - parody on American football).
The series was promoted by many famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, “Comrade Detective” is too focused on the unwilling propaganda drama – which includes the murderer with Reagan’s mask – and according to that it also looks like.
Six long episodes are too disturbing and comedy moments are not enough.
With a shorter trace, the propaganda satir in the “Comrade Detective” could work, like in the scene where Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in which the hall two thick bears the hamburgers made on a large crowd.
The clear message for the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can transform everything into food and orgy.
The thought of the Romanian creators did not be wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with their own.
Russian athletes did not wait for the IAAF ban.
The International Athletic Federation (IAAF) at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian racing starts due to the state-backed doping program.
The vote in the event of the world championship, which will begin on Friday, is expected to be very clear.
166 delegates voted for the prohibition, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is, above all, the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an antidoping system, as stated before the congress the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
The group recommended the ban to continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard, and in the country still work coaches with a scattered reputation.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is still not fully functioning.
However, RUSADA can already conduct tests under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Al progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes came among other things losing the last year’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Through the prohibition, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Cup, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
At the championship they will not be able to start in national colors and in case of victory they will not play the Russian hymn.
Bank of England to maintain a 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by unmarkable economic growth and inflation weakening, which added speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to be "in the background" in connection with the maintenance of interest rates - despite family budgets.
The Committee on Monetary Policy (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets will continue.
The bank also suggested that inflation due to Brexit is expected to grow over the next few years, and also said that mobility rent should grow more on the financial markets than expected.
The committee members also voted for the withdrawal of a part of the mammoth package, the task of which was to support the economy, and which was introduced a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the deadline funding plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should begin to apply from February next, although the Bank of England said it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC predicts that GDP will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and consumption burden.”
On the subject of the rates, the bank said it would be necessary to “track the penalty policy belt” to calm the inflation, “in a higher degree” than the markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and the next growth in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that any increase would be “slow” and “limited”.
The bank has lowered its growth forecast for this and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The expected growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing growth buried hopes for further growth - the GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
The growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a small comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wages rise.
The report further states that the monetary policy “can not prevent” the decrease in revenue in the coming years, but it is expected that wages will rise “significantly” at the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to a great interest in British goods due to a weak pound, which compensates a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came a year after the interest rates were lowered to 0.025% in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused a drop in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates along with the rising inflation, which had increased pressure on households.Three political figures demanded a rise to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June 2.9%, even though the bank said it was expecting such a change and the inflation is expected to rise again in the next month.
The bank said that the excess relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it seems that the competition on the mortgage market will only rise as soon as creditors begin to compete for contracts with a good outlook for the end of the year.
The market looks good for those to whom the existing contracts and re-hypotheses end - there are options free of charge, as well as low rates that they get on popularity.”
NHS prescribes controversial HIV medicine to 10,000 patients
Patients will get access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention from September on the basis of the Supreme Court’s decision to finance the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year with the statement that NHS has funds to pay PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was adopted by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a ‘important intervention’, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a ‘defining moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV drug administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among the endangered patients.
Application of PrEP before sex means that a sufficient amount of specific medications is found in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partners who are not treated successfully.
Clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in the test, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered at the GP in the UK can also register at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in the test.
The program will come taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England has signed this week a deal to distribute drugs after obtaining an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and evaluate the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and fully take advantage of the ever-growing and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It’s another milestone in more than thirty years’ efforts to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients in danger, it will offer the possibility of transition of the English HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients exposed to a high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to improved quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement.”
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘Priority number one must be the rapid implementation of tests throughout the country; we must ensure its availability to every patient.
Now we have a PrEP test drug available and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP test period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will bring us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together to stop the spread of HIV in society.”
Life on high feet: interipatro and smart design have transformed this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former bankier with a passion for real estate, replaced a big house in Knightsbridge in 2014 with an apartment in Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is a clear exhibition of modern design, which takes advantage of the maximum available space.
“I had previously lived with my ex-wife in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood,” Joanne said.
I was looking for something at a reasonable price.
I found this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the roof.
Soon I fell in love with him, and then I fell in love with him.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has passed a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add discharge spaces and interipatro to take advantage of the high roof.
“I was looking for a high roof, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my demands,” she said.
For this purpose, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed based in Notting Hill and used a four-meter roof to create a house that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The roof did not reach such a height that there were two gap over each other – the challenge for architects was to create a interpatro on which one could walk upward.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk up straight.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time wrapping the steel structure so that it was in the right height above and below the roof.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to build two full-time rooms on each other - and at the same time add to dramaticity.
In the middle floor, it looks at the beautiful living room of old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro lustr Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror sheet in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance doors are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storage of accessories and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the entire apartment an impression of a significantly greater space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen, if not used.
The kitchen is nothing new.
What is unique in this solution, however, are the sliding doors.
“We had to solve the technical side,” Erfan tells about the reinforced dying doors.
“The doors are equipped with a counterweight so that they can turn off very easily.”
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage spaces, Joanne got another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes to it, then what you sell is the housing area – or the appreciation of your property,” Erfan said.
“The real estate broker in essence, when entering the apartment, counts the estimate of its price based on the living area.”
In this case, it managed to increase the living area while preserving quality materials that lend the space a luxury appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with the home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love electricity in the walls.
Yes, they’re important, but your hearts won’t get.”
As it has been shown, quality design and the increase of living space can transform a ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can eventually decide to stay.
The United States is uniting.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee has paid it and declared revenge for a ban on its citizens traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a prohibition in the full sense, citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout all the 50 states.
This is the fact that California has banned spending government money on traveling its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and any manifestation of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle considers discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted the Conscience Reserve Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obliged to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who has no such problem.
Texas and other states, on the other hand, have adopted laws that the religious charity organizations that have adopted children from mothers after their birth have no obligation to provide these children for adoption to equal gender couples.
Because of these consciousness reservation laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens’ trips to eight EU states from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors should not have the way to scientific symposium, for example, in Texas, paid off from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must either get federal grants on their roads, but it is absurd that the federal government finances the travel of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsoring.
The state of Tennessee has been patient and its parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that it also does not like the California policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of this.
It is a rescue for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same shall happen to each State of the Union which would impose a similar travel prohibition on another State for any reason.
He also urged the parliaments of all countries to stop this madness.
This is the fact, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
Everything is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on conservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go and what they cannot.
Secondly, what is wrong with consciousness reservation?
When a hunter has a religious problem selling pigs, why should he not offer only cattle, sheep, poultry and fish?
Why should he be sentenced to be forced to sell the pigs when the pigs offer the pigs are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high penalty for refusing to bak the cake for a gay wedding.
He also refuses to cook Halloween cakes or alcohol.
Why do you punish him and don’t let him stand and not order the corresponding cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but the individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policy in non-Federal powers according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought for tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not tolerance to themselves and to others, but extreme intolerance to others.
They say no one should ever manifest moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don’t know the situation in American history when the states did such intentions because of political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the times of the struggle for black people’s civil rights, where the north and the west were on the integration side and the south on the segregation side, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s of the 19th century, the political cause was the slavery and the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue-democratic and the red-republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally internally united.
unauthorized agitation.
The criticism of Putin was punished.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the campaign before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court sentenced him to a fine for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
The official head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but it is generally expected that he will do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to him home in the morning and brought him to court.
He was sentenced to a fine for calling people to demonstrate through videos on the YouTube portal.
The penalty is 300,000.
“Later we will cut them out of the salary of the judge,” the Kremlin critic laughed on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny was not allowed to participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of fraud.
Nevertheless, Navalny, who is considered a anti-corruption fighter, considers the judgment as politically motivated.
A fine of 300 thousand rubles, including 25 thousand rubles, the court on Thursday also imposed two members of the Navalny pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyy entered the Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant personality on the broken opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year conditional sentence for stealing the Kirovles forestry enterprise.
The judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in May.
The judgment is so legitimate, which prevents Navalny from being a candidate according to the Russian law.
Brothers Fight for a $500 Million Imperium
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the Empire by their Italian family, throw down one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who had a dispute about joint assets and commercial assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business already in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly prosecuted before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers owned a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first business was purchased by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew into a chain with 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the whole company for $85 million.
For the money, additional properties were purchased and the De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburb.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is a “important driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court documents indicate that Colin owns property worth $316 million, while Paul manages property worth $176 million.
For Paul, the problem was the division of assets and funds.
“Colin’s proposal appeared in my eyes significantly in his favour,” Paul wrote in a subsequent statement at the court in 2015.
The first meeting of the Supreme Court took place on Friday, after several failure attempts to reach reconciliation.
Brothers now compete also about who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, Colin cut off.
Colin is opposed by saying that this is not true and accuses Paul of misbehavior with some properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of cross-country statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, flood advocates, including Allana Myers, QC and advocates of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and flavours since the 1950s and in the 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
For the money gained by building the property they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of college, Paul was still a young, about 10 year old boy.”
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigim, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would take place after good.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the company group of the De Lutis family. Colin said that Mark had been compensated for $10 million when he left and Luke for $26 million.
As Paul said, Luke and Mark were “not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been back since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, a famous television person and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only answered through a text report in which he stated that given the fact that the dispute is settled before the court, “I have nothing to add to it.”
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to resolve the whole matter before the court,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, in one of the statements before the court, Colin stated that he tried to adapt to the demands of his brother.
“Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that “he’s still hoping for a successful solution.”
On Friday, all the hopes were untouched.
“Our disputes will be resolved in a short time by court trial,” Colin wrote.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
The MHD drivers are facing water and summer clothes.
At the school in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they go out only in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not provide a big shade yet.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers shower the children in the cloud.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classes, where the gloves are pulled and the curtains are pulled.
They try to cool the air with air cleaning because they don’t have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cookers.
“The temperature, which is both inside and outside, exceeds the hygienic limits for primary schools, so in this period we should not actually have an open operation,” said school director Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the school, where the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We venture in the morning after 6 a.m., the windows are closed and we have a gallery on the south side to protect ourselves.
“But it won’t help much,” she added.
Better conditions have in the forest school Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the ground, so we are under them.
“We have a beautiful orange there, a table under it, and there we do different things,” said Barbora Kompanova, director of the school.
Teachers are trying to walk with children to the forest, where there is a greater clay.
The children are wet caps and on the program they have a variety of games with water.
“We have a hand pressure spray that is used for flower spray and we use it for children’s shower,” Kompanova said.
Also the director of the maternity school in Novoborská street in Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers are trying to keep the children in the shadow and drops them with water.
“We have a fairly grown garden, so they’re there under trees,” she said.
They go out in the morning and then until 15 p.m.
Every child must have a head cover.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and in the garden they have a pit with water.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and a snack with fresh fruits and vegetables, which parents sometimes bring to them.
"Maybe today here one mom brought about ten-kilometer melon for children," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or summer equinox.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer equinox in hot days.
The cabins of tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to the cabins, some trains are air-conditioned in the passenger area.
High temperature railways have not seriously damaged.
A small damage occurred in the hostel.
At the present high temperatures, we focus on ensuring that drivers have sufficient amounts of drinks available.
“Chladened drinking water is available in all slides, shifting points and car routes,” Grehková said.
In the railway stations and in some exchanges, employees have the so-called soda bars, which produce refrigerated soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers during their daily exchanges," the spokesman added.
The hot and dry weather in the last few days has led to an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic liquidated 108, which is twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, the day when the temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters employed mainly fire fighting.
“There are predominant fires in the natural environment as well as those that are associated with grain works,” said firefighters spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the evening weather changes did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and rainfall.
In connection with the storm, the firefighters went out to 236 interventions.
It was mainly the removal of struck trees and branches.
“The most involved in the Central Czech region,” Zaoralova continues.
The help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolínk na Českolipsku, where, due to the storm, 60 people were evacuated from the children's camp.
Tropical temperatures have also attributed work to Prague rescue workers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, the ambulance went out to dozens of cases of carbon dioxide poisoning.
People should therefore let their water heater check, rescue workers warn.
Carbon dioxide is an uncolored gas without smell, which is released with imperfect burning.
Symptoms of poison include nausea, vomiting, headache and a feeling of fatigue.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the contaminated room.
Trump's new head of staff plans to limit president's media diet
A lot of people tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the White House's new head of staff plans to restrict Trump's information flow - including reports in television news - in the hope that it will keep Trump on the level.
Here is a part of the report by Josh Dawseye:
“When the new White House Staff Chief John F. Kelly met with his staff on the first day of his new office, he pointed out the key problem of Trump’s White House that he intends to fix: the wrong information that comes to the president’s hands.
Kelly told staff that he must personally approve all information – whether on paper or speech – because the president can make a better decision based on the right information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth on Trump’s control and his presence in the media.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates several decades ago – and now, when he’s sitting in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was annoyed by honest reports, it was suitable for him to show that a lot of other media talked about him in a positive light that was easier to convince,” said in February for Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign adviser.
Tara Palmeri, from Politico, wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets on the ground – at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers – is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that praise him.”
and good.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his opinions on Twitter was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Per these campaign organizers know something others don’t know about – that Trump’s tweets would be more annoying if someone didn’t control them.
About tweets that Trump has never sent, we will probably never know.
If his employees managed to keep him at least several times on the ground, then their efforts did not go out.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from raising controversial topics.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by pushing Trump's materials - which can but may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisors to submit doubtful information to the head of state in May.
This is an example of such information from the reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“Trump’s current and former officials claim that the president often responds very angry to negative news from the media, especially the news of information leakage, and strives to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone submitted the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com – the provokator’s website Charles C. Johnson – which accused Staff Chief Deputy Katie Walsh of being “the source of many information leaks” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever convicted from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not submit his claims with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then head of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of the White House Rob Porter “have tried to implement a system for managing and documenting the information that President Trump will receive.”
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to pursue the same strategy.
Per it will prove he is a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsivity will not be lost and his assistants are still competing for power.
These unchanged factors of Kelly's mission will surely be burdened.
Tourists Negotiate a Breakthrough and Return to 'Millionaire Quarter'
A few of the most real estate owners of homes in the British County of West Midland are again put into a bar with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the right to regain the field for their seats.
Tourists parked 20 karavans on the field near the flourishing street in Solihull, which is called the 'Millionaire Quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and the army of karavans, tourists return after they were dismissed in May. They didn't even lock the hole, which was grown on the site on the basis of the orders of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
The tact group found the gap in defense and penetrated the field with karavans with the unprotected gap that served for the way.
The residents of the neighborhood attacked Solihull’s administration council with the saying that “they are unable to solve the problem.”
One of the inhabitants, who wanted to stay in anonymity, said: ‘They occupied the place on Monday night after they were moved to the Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones on the other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed for their inability to solve the problem.
All tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
Last night they arrived, and today they’ll be even more.”
She added: 'Birmingham Board knows how to deal with this problem. it uses court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook and I am not going to pay taxes until the board of directors deal with tourists.”
Another of the anonymous inhabitants said: ‘It’s ridiculous. just recently we watched the last traveling tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they have brought their horses with them."
A spokesman for the City Hall of Solihull said: ‘We are aware of the unlawful stay on the land near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police we are taking the necessary legal steps to successfully solve the whole problem.
In order to collect as many evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible report any non-social or illegal behavior of the police on number 101.
So we will get the overall picture that we will submit to the court.”
A woman crashed in a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special transported the wounded Robert Žitňansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
At the airport were waiting two ambulance and on board the aircraft was under the constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight passed without any complications.
Robert Zhytňansky had a serious accident in Brussels in early summer, according to TV JOJ.
He was told that the car crashed and he has been in serious condition since then.
After transporting to the homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak deputy Jany Žitňanské from NOVA.
She did not want to speak about the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians struggle against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent rescue ships arriving to the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities captured a ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trafficking in people, significantly facilitating illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which works for the first year, refused to comment on the whole case on the grounds of the accusation by Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
“For us, the number one priority is and will always be the rescue of human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at the moment,” the organization said in a statement on social networks.
“All current accusations can be commented only after we have collected all the information and assessed the whole situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Youth Rettet’s Iuventa ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants on the ship, which were handed over directly by human traffickers, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the prosecutor's file, allegedly just 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and surrounding the Italian coastal guard, which oversee the rescue operations in the area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct stipulates the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organization said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, as they do not represent any “significant change or obstacle” with regard to rescue operations.
The new Code of Conduct has also been rejected by the Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the Nobel Prize winner.
Meanwhile, Minniti has heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in the past few weeks, which are displacing themselves in Italy as part of the rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen the guards on the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bring fruit.
“In the last few days we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks that will be held this month with the Libyan mayor on the economic development initiative as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Unfortunately, it has been a silicone and cellulite!
The hot summer days entirely enable you to take on you only the most necessary thing that will cover the most intimate parties.
Dominica Mesaroš does the opposite.
On the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, just hemped, their body covered into a mini overal.
And just a few regular moves were enough and the model showed to everyone its silicons, but also the stick.
Overal, for how many times he cut her between the half, also scattered her so high that she had to adjust it.
There was no need for the attention of the present photographers.
Michelle Carter sentenced for sending text messages inciting Conrad Roye to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will be sentenced to 15 months of two-year prison sentence and then spend five years in conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is shaken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was released until the decision was made.
She was threatened up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered a mental illness.
Clothed in red pants and a cream bluse, Carter stood in the declaration of the judgment on the spot with tears in the eyes, scattered hands and eyes toward the ground.
“His proceedings killed Conrad Roye,” the prosecutor told the judges.
She ended her life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t take her own responsibility,” she said.
“He did not show regrets.”
However, Carter’s lawyer said that these were “unhappy circumstances which he extremely regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder have no significant impact on her behavior.”
The prosecutor read Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement: "It will not run a single day to not worry about the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me – I take care of his sisters and together we will bear the tremendous pain we will carry with us forever.”
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, has witnessed that she’s “pronounced” by the consciousness that she will never take part in the brother’s wedding and will never be the aunt of his children.
“The loss of the person I’ve met since I was born is the pain I’ll bear for life.”
The state of Massachusetts has no current law that would punish a person helping to suicide another person.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in 2014 on a car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the whole nation after the text reports of Carter were published that encouraged suicide.
“I don’t care if you’re hanging, jumping out of the building, or jumping, it doesn’t matter,” Carter wrote in a text message just two weeks before his death when Roy was on a family holiday.
A few minutes before suicide she wrote to him, “You have to do this Conrade” and “You just have to hit the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood on the side of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder of her British co-habitant in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30) posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi will repair up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW’s chairman said the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is BMW’s headquarters – considering the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler on Tuesday announced that it will repair three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European automotive manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel actuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide that is released by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automotive manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize gas emissions by diesel engines, which makes the competitiveness of the cars worse.
While German automotive manufacturers are faced with careful surveys, Chancellor Angela Merkel is faced with accusations of melting powerful automotive companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, who, in an effort to meet emission limits, installed in their cars software that during testing reduced the amount of emissions, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been accused in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the termodynamics department for engine development at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is not subject to extradition, so he can face a trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi took part in a criminal investigation by the German police in the Volkswagen case after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that had to cross European emission limits – and thus extended the accusations that Audi faces in the U.S.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation may have a bad impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The aircraft landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told SIC News that the plane before landing flighted just above the people who were sunny on the beach.
Some people from the beach allegedly fled from danger to the sea.
Two people were unable to escape the machine.
On the beach, a 50-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl were killed.
“The aircraft crashed and they were dead on the site,” said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both lived out of the accident and the police took them to investigate.
D11 or how not to build the highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic complete?
I will give you a puzzle.
It is unprecedented, although it began to be built in 1978.
Even if it is not done, it is constantly corrected.
It is not permitted to be built even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Highway D11.
The construction of the next section has been suspended by the Children of the Earth for at least a few months.
We, the Eastern Czechs, get the highway by pieces, as if the salams are cut.
We’ll get the wheel and then we’ll see when and if we get the next one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the travel time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The endless streams of trucks go directly through the city of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not as reasonably obtained.
But so far the last part of our dream highway was operated in 2008, that is, incredible nine years ago.
From then on, no tick.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové began to be built recently, and on the other sections to Jaromera began an archaeological exploration with the fact that the construction began at the end of this year, you could hear a loud blow of spunts in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that it will not be built this year.
Maybe not next year.
The Children’s Land-Club Movement for Sustainable Transportation from Brna has made a breakdown.
Children of the Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
Decisions on construction permits have been adopted.
In the dissolution, they request a review of all already issued binding opinions by all relevant authorities.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Dresden Office.
So far, from the D11 we descend near the village with the explanatory name Funeral.
So we descend, we just go on the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to subsequently enter the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
A terrible, constantly stuck road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has his funeral.
What do the children of the earth demand?
What is the importance of communication in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network practically incomplete in the existing system?
Read in the new reflection.
Levandula from Provence threatens climate change
Levandules have become the symbol of Provence in south-eastern France, but are now threatened by climate change.
Levandula decreases due to the dry climate and harmful insects, causing horrors on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is in danger because in recent years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
They are also guilty of cycades and cowboys carrying micro-bacteria, which succeed in a dry climate.”
There is a lot of betting.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil that is produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is obviously smaller.”
The possible solution can be more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spray the lavender with a protective mixture of yellow and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights rising threats in Mexico
The staff of the Riodoce Weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news about the disruptions that are ongoing in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and continuing drug wars.
Today, however, under the impact of recent events, they meet mainly because of their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: take their children with you to the office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009 or leave them home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to indicate the names of each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and prejudice.
Choosing them from what - drug traders, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose task is to cover criminal acts.
Violence continues and bodies are put on the crowd across the country; journalists among them are increasing: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists there are at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Niet came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states there have been seven killed this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the journal Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence linked to drug trafficking.
His loss is sensitive, although his presence is all-transcendent - the big photo of Valdeze with the inscription "Justice", on which the mediator shows, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a t-shirt with the photo of Valdeze with a smile on the face, glasses on the nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the establishment of a special federal prosecutor's office in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, the Committee on the Protection of Journalists has so far charged two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime.
Journalists from Riodoca insist on informing about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by sadness and the territory is currently very traitory.
Without information about the crashes and without the vision of justice, the security meeting is unthinkable, Ibarra says.
“It’s stupid to waste time on such meetings,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoce in Culiacano, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to take a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then entered his car and broke him near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left a wife and two children.
It seems that in Culiacan the rumors are spreading quickly.
However, in the case of Valdez, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields as rival factions are trying to fill the empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is filled with scattered two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Remember for a moment that the word “fireplace” means that a single drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was confidently acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, is still angry by not protecting his friend.
He believes that two mistakes have contributed to his death.
The first was the February release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the competing drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquin Guzman.
The peace could rage the sons; the suspected members of the gang picked up all the copies of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the tables.
The second mistake was not to force Valdeza to leave the country for his own safety after capturing other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad and his death is seen as an important milestone in the struggle of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive so long and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the journal Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares for $50 and set up together with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, it was “impossible to operate a journalism and not to mention drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoce gained a good reputation over time for courageous and true news; the newspapers began to succeed.
Journalists were pleased to get into search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - the readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting about Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courageous reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was afraid of my life,” he said when receiving the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “a way of life,” Valdez said in October last year in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take the role of a journalist – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do in the face of death... why did you not say what’s happening?’”
The employees of Riodoce missed Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and unselectable language. He was a good friend who loved giving advice and embraces - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all rely on their daily routine.
He always wears his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar in front of the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they wonder: did this routine blame his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
“They don’t like when you interfere with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas.”
“These things were prohibited,” said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-sensure and self-reservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something doesn’t play here, take your hands away.
The problem is in that, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that “this is a sense that can be crazy... and then that happened to Javier.”
The old rules according to him, as according to others, in Sinaloae no longer apply - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative trafficking paths, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The country is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; a few days ago a spyware was discovered that the government bought to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the town district of Culiacanu.
The journalists are wondering whether these police officers do not belong to those 50 percent of lawmakers who, according to government statements, are corrupt.
It’s been a few months since journalists last went to the mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first of them is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chavez in Sinaloe.
They are also admitted to suspicious government spending that took place in the country's native city of the governor.
Recently there were also several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacana, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists had to be careful when they were going to write about what every resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug traders and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption at high positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman escaped the military intervention unit.
Even a month ago, readers would read about this topic in the Valdez rubric, which was the best source of information about the kidnapping.
“Valdez would dissolve the case,” said Villarreal (46), who is called “El Flaco” for his thin figure.
Now all the journalists have turned their back to us.”
Valdez's office has turned into a warehouse of ceds and a label to protest against the killing of journalists. The employees didn't expect them to become activists in the presence.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez caught several ceds and went to demonstrate next morning in front of the prosecutor's office because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the Michoacan state.
Only a burned body was discovered. authorities claim that on the basis of DNA analysis it was Adam.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and climb on the roads and buildings of the “SOS press”.
The newspaper director Bojorquez is on a day visiting Washington, where he tries to get international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloy, which took place a day after the assassination of Valdeza, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for telling the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a translation to another department for fear that her anger could threaten her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “obstained” by organized crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his latest book “Narco-journalism” he wrote that journalists die not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and security forces that cooperate with organized crime.
Media surveillance group Articulo 19 has accused more than half of all attacks on journalists of police and public officials.
“You’re going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez said.
Murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which happened six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with the message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended because of my messages.”
Beside the head was a keyboard and a headset.
Some branches have decided to end their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte, headquartered near the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of reporters Miroslav Breach.
Others continue, just as they did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed publicly drug cartels with an article on the home page entitled “What do you want from us”?
Some journalists fled from their homes or even across the border.
It is a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone constantly persecutes you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after he fled from Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their work, every day represents a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, acknowledges that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, so I’ve become a journalist,” he said.
It is Friday's midnight and the employees of Riodoce are sitting on the pathway in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer, when there suddenly the phone starts calling.
It is that 19 people were killed in a shooting between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is graduating, precisely as promised by many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
It will not last a day and the title will change again.
The sound of the police sirens indicates a further shooting.
Bojorquez throws a lightning look at the police guard to make sure they are paying attention.
If they are afraid, they do not reveal it.
Under the enormous portrait of the falling co-founder of their journal - whose mediator is an exciting slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all the employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
“How could we just think of going,” said Bojorquez, “when one internist asked me to send her to the streets on the same day Javier was killed?”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first findings of the amazing creature of the size of a nasorrhoea, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called 'Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs' - was found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved in such a high degree that experts were able to determine the red-green color of his scratched skin and said the dinosaur had a ‘problematic past’.
The article in the Current Biology magazine stated that it was “the most preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best species of dinosaurs in the world.”
The minerals are a new species of the Nodosauridae family. The dinosaurus lived in the Crimea period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved state literally shocked the researchers who described him with the words 'really remarkable'.
According to National Geographic, it is the best preserved fossil of its species.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on 21 March 2011 in a Suncor Millenium mine near Canada's Albert.
He found something that looked like a strange object and decided to explore it closer.
The minerals were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the following six years working to uncover an animal from an enormous piece of earth weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
“It’s just a little to swallow your eyes and you’ll believe he’s asleep,” said Caleb Brown, the head of work and the natural scientist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
It will be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.
By studying his skin, researchers found that this beef - even though it was covered with bruns and resembled a walking tank - was very likely to face a serious threat by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavy-armed dinosaur used the red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used the masking system that many of today’s animals use.
Experts say that it allowed him to better fuse with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that it was the favorite food of bigger dinosaurs.
News about the 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in the newspapers in May. It is currently available for view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully discovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the forms and shapes of holes and arms throughout the body.
They discovered the masking method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far beyond today’s animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution gave priority to masking before confrontation when surviving.
Many of the contemporary animals with masking - for example, the elephant, the zebra, and or the band - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a hostage, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for his survivors.
“The betrayal of a huge and heavy-armed dinosaur clearly illustrates the dangers that predators represented during the Crusade period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the spots also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was likely to have a red brown color.
The researchers continue to study the animal and look for further insights about his life, including the preserved stomach content, to find his last food.
They believe that the dinosaur after his death fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he drowned to the bottom.
In the area of Alberta there was at the time the same climate as in today’s Florida and the rivers and oceans stretched much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scratched skin and at the same time is preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For this reason, the animal looks almost the same as at the time of the cruise.
You don’t need to use your imagination to reconstruct it; it’s just a little to swallow your eyes and it looks like it’s just asleep.”
During the period of the Crusade, enormous teropods, mass-eating dinosaurs, passed through the Earth, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived a few million years after Borealopelta, this armed dinosaur could be the favorite hostage of his equally terrible ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meters long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelta was swim into the sea after it was mummified in the shell.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on 21 March 2011 in a Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the neck to the knee.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
From his shoulders, he had two 50 cm dots.
Researchers believe that this beef broke the territory of today's Canada until it ended in the river that flooded it into the sea.
His submarine tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the neck still cover skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, ‘finding a so-conserved individual can be compared to winning in a lottery.
The longer I follow it, the more shocking it seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the neck still cover skin remains.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers upward.
I can easily count the holes on his legs."
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked throughout her body.
A day after arriving in New York, a family member from St. Louis sat down on a bed in an Airbnb room and browse Facebook posts on her phone.
He received the contribution of a high school student.
“The police have just shot down a 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street,” he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her posts on the wall.
The St. Louis Rapper posted on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body, which is unheldly on the street, where no one took him away even after four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She postponed the phone to go back to him in the evening when she watched tweets about people gathered on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed he was the father of the victim and held a cedar in his hand with the inscription "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a guide in the hand and on his other end of a scratching dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she said, held a gun in his hand, he targeted the crowd and cried, “I will kill you all... animals.”
“It’s not normal,” Ferrell said.
“This is not the type of murder that we are accustomed to and that we can call normal.
I felt my skin hurt throughout my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She ordered a return flight and returned home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided that they would go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what has happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and unbreakability told from the perspective of people living in the community who go out to the streets and seeking answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter – dressed in a flower dress and the same flower sheet – on a topic that they had discussed many times before – “the experience with the black.”
“Do you remember how I taught you how the black people had to fight for what they believed in?” he recalls the interview.
“We are going to Ferguson now because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“It didn’t seem to be considered that I would not take her with me,” Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the peak that happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but also had to know the difference between the different layers of black experiences and what we need to do to get free.
Although I’m able to provide her with conditions in which she won’t experience on her own skin racism, it doesn’t differ in any way from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I would protect her from this experience, I would only hurt her.”
After arrival in Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was in front of the police department, which became the base of activists waiting for the police officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible participation in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local entrepreneur who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared the food in the bags and helped dissolve it to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to slowly be born.
“My activism turned up after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that during her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the chairman of the Association of Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce healthcare and food in the black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-rector of the document, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “only document” the ongoing events.
But Ferrell wondered, “Do you work on a document or are you trying to find a story that can be used?”
Such a type of skepticism penetrated into the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked and that we wanted to change.”
Folayan has already collaborated with co-register Damon Davis, a well-known local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners in the death cell.
His participation in the project also included Ferrell and six other local people who were watched by the Whose Streets team in the years following the Murder of Brown.
“Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it’s our dismissal,” Davis said.
“It was important to me – how these people will be represented – because in the same way I will be represented.”
While the document’s goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences – in an attempt to show that the movement “is not about the savior leader, but about the community’s approach,” said Folayan – it turned out that she is the most open to participating in filming.
“Whose Streets?” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, for example how she fell in love with her wife.
“I felt like naked,” said Ferrell with a smile on her face while thinking about the first moment she looked at the final version of the document.
“I understood, however, that in order to be able to do this work and polygonize the black people, I have to open myself.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story emphasizes the role of a central black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created a campaign on social media under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the murder of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 – call themselves strange.
“Black outcentric women in the lead positions ultimately stand behind the preservation of the movement,” said Ferrell, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black outcentric women must bear the weight of these events.”
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of out-of-centric black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not just an affirmative matter” and Ferrell is not the protagonist of the document because of her opinions.
“It was the driving force and the source of energy,” she said.
“It is not a coincidence that she was in the front lines, because life on these crossroads in the skin of a black woman is dangerous.
You feel the energy flow in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television stations’ cameras have cleaned their positions, but heavy racial bonds between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell has been sentenced to two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstrations.
The social-political atmosphere in the area, which he calls home described as “Unrest.”
However, he does not keep in his effort to which he was committed since he travelled to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
“The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
A field burned in Cologne.
Thousands of firefighters arrived and a helicopter helped.
Near the Czech Boat in Cologne, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, fire from 14:00 a field of about 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, the firefighters announced a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to a spokesman for firefighters, Ladislav Holomčík, the fire helped fire from the air and a helicopter.
At 6:00 p.m. firefighters were able to shut down the fire, causing a damage of 700,000 kronor.
There were dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters on the ground.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the motor space of the combo.
A helicopter was killed and a helicopter was killed and a helicopter was killed and a helicopter was killed.
"Instead of the intervention we gave it to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 he will be watched by the unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is located just a few faces of different shades of the skin - white, black and eaten - hanged from the roof on the wire.
All 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the mouth holes and hair drawings sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning has sent her samples from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where she has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for unlawful disclosure of secret cablograms on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident, whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before he left the U.S. presidency.
By using Manning's DNA algorithmic analysis and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would look, Dewey-Hagborg's brick created, if not, an intellectual comment on the subjectivity of DNA - as well as on many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the irreversible determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has talked since her youth that she is considered a woman. She was sentenced in 2013 on the basis of twenty charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
Only one lower-quality black-and-white photo has escaped to the public, on which Manning, apparently worried, sits on the driver's seat in a platinum blonde pair with which she is now connected.
In 2015, they were still aware of the positive responses to the 2012 Stranger Visions project by Dewey-Hagborg.
In the framework of this project, Dewey-Hagborg has used various forensic objects – such as cigarette bars and sweaters – to create an image of the possible shapes of these people.
And just at that time she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait,” Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photographs were not allowed, so they addressed Chelsea with a question whether she would be interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her prisoned mosaic fell in friendship over two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic entitled Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was forgiven and could participate in the exhibitions personally.
President Obama actually asked for Manning's release a few days after the release of the comic, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in the military prison in Kansas.
It is really interesting that the exhibition takes place just in a time when Donald Trump leads a war with people seeking to disclose government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate hatred in the areas he should support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “all is happening for some reason.”
Under the artist’s statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her enormous signature (the letter “i” in the surname is stumbled by the heart) for the end of a “self-working fractionality based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite side, there are sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - a stone of letters C, G and A recorded with a pen.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we are all.
“I hope people get rid of it, that our genome doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can explain it in their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last copy of the exhibition, placed in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging as King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in hand.
“When they stop you in speech, they win,” she writes.
“Never let yourself silence.”
“It’s a direct translation of one of the letters,” the Philadelphia artist said.
“When I think about it, my skin is scratched.”
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition personally - which was predicted in the comic - but when that happens, she will be welcomed in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic images, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the almost 160 cm high statue of Maning, on which its genetic haplosgroups are recorded with a pen.
“In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to make a sense of crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
“I wanted to get the impression of a mass movement that takes the shape of Chelsea and liberates her.”
Professor of the Northwestern University and Oxford University staff searched for murder
On this day, a national search is ongoing for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are prosecuted for suspicion of murder of a man who was found killed in a luxury Chicago apartment, the police said.
On Monday, an arrest was issued for the first-degree murder of men named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleaua.
In the document it is written that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from the consequences of several points wounds.
The police said the body of the dead was found on July 27.
After arrival in the Grand Plaza Apartments they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the site and detectives are investigating the case as a murder.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University for Public Relations, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was prohibited from entering the university’s school spaces.
“The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University is fully collaborating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: “The British police have contacted us and we are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and want him to sign up to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Public Relations of the Chicago Police Department said he calls on suspects to give up to the competent authorities.
“The police have information about their place of residence and the attempts to find suspects are increasing,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are helping the police in the search of the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a telephone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was warned of the events to occur in the apartment number 1008.
Police described the scene as violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lath and Warren were captured by security cameras.
“We believe Professor Latham knew his victim,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: “The police are now working on making a timeline and profile of the victims and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
“In the near future we will complete the WADA plan,” Russian Prime Minister Mutko said.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take a long time and the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be re-established.
“At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already gained the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With regard to this fact, the WADA plan has been updated,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutk, the code does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
One of these criteria, however, calls after the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, on alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system obviously failed.
All measures were taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country and therefore we cannot admit to something that has never existed.”
Mutk's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, the director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with the Russian RSport, Smirnov admitted the problems of the Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “In many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservations,” Smirnov concluded.
The WADA suspected that Russia had carried out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
After a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “on the right way” to resume its validity.
Police have accused three people, one of whom is a teenager.
Police accused three men of building a rare wooden church fire on Wednesday in Třinci-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místecku.
One of the accused is a young man, all three of whom are of Czech nationality.
For a criminal offence of general threat, they are threatened up to 15 years in prison.
This was by Moravskoslez police director Tomáš Kužel.
He said it was a deliberate crime.
“It’s a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motivation of the whole matter,” Kužel said.
He said the police will negotiate about the possible withdrawal of the accused.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
“More I can’t tell for now, because it’s actually the work of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service staff and the prosecutor who oversees the matter,” Kužel said.
The wooden church of the body of God in Gutes came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage is estimated to be up to tens of millions of crowns, but the historic loss is unmatched.
Soon after the fire, the church began to be renovated.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the City, the public collection is also prepared and the contribution of the monument owner, the local parish, is counted.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabova also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
This caused a failure in the electrical installation.
There was an accurate copy in his place.
The state counts with citizens in the defense of the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for the associations used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the objective of the law on the preparation of citizens for the defence of the state is counted.
The Ministry of Defense, which its processing received a task from the government, promises from him that it will succeed in increasing the physical capacity of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is based on the proposal that the Ministry has made.
If the law was adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the defence.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the preparation of the people of the Czech Republic for the defense of the state, beyond the performance of the defense duty and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would finance or material support the associations of radioamaters, shooters or kynologists and would allow to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, it would obtain data about the people who are willing to come to the country at a time of crisis if necessary for assistance, and their abilities or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors who would help the associations and other interested parties in their training or education.
It also counts to organize talks with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One of the possible variants assumes that a new office would be created to be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state should take advantage of their capabilities only after the declaration of the state of threat.
“The whole concept must respect the gradual deletion of previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats,” the draft states with reference to the dangers of the so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that therefore it is necessary to focus on supporting the broadest possible range of capabilities, not only those of the military.
“The basic objective of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to qualifiedly respond to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and wrong behavior will not make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to perform their tasks.”
The adoption of the law would bring little financial claims.
The amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office is expected to provide financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to 100 million SEK.
If an administrative and coordination center was established, its operation could cost around 60 million SEK per year.
More money would go to wages or to the construction of an information system.
The proposal also presupposes the extension of the scope of the district military command, which would employ another 42 soldiers together.
The ministry’s representatives have previously stated that the law should also help solve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union Directive on the possession of weapons.
Its acceptance would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees of her e-commerce startup, but did not find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their confidence in the whole process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of the e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
He asked for help from the outside.
New human resource startups are constantly emerging on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
Through the creation and licensing of software with a specific intention of measuring employees’ duties, startups enable companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offering full anonymity of employees and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases also enable informers to circumvent the top and contact the director directly.
“There are tools on the market like Diet and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glinta, she gained greater awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers the company’s temperature map and an overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a overview of managers with low ratings – allowing the user to work on the correction.
Companies begin to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the work environment - for the event that they would become another Uber - which is melting in scandals after the former employee posted a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and disturbing employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture research is a profitable business opportunity.
According to the website Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial advances, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies in prevention and detection of inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Among the 600 customers of Convercent are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently taken its wings.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “black” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hot line that allows employees to report unsuitable behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
“The Court of Public Opinion has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convercent startup.
If a company is convicted of misconduct with its employees or unethical behavior - and if the regulators do not step forward - it may face expensive consequences due to customer boycott, employee exhaust or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure a easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to search for the telephone number or e-mail to the company’s management, officially submit a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s Chief Executive Officer, that there was no reliable way to track employees’ complaints before.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it is secured to quickly detect and solve problems that have never before reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from real complaints solving - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It’s close to a holistic, overall view of the staff’s experience,” said Vitrano, who manages the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
At the same time, we protect shareholders from legal disputes by employees.”
Companies ceased to take ethics, values and employee participation to light weight in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron's fall in the matter of employee ethical rights abuse, Quinlan said.
But only when the “social media” began to realize that in the online world they can’t simply hide their bone marrow in the closet.
“Before people started using ethics to track technology, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by courageous capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent picked up a total of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital as part of its February campaign and eventually took up $47 million capital.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising due to the mutual nature of societies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect from their workplace more than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to realize that they are accepted and appreciated and that they spend their time in a company that seeks a positive mission.
“When people are happy in their work, they realize that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the company’s success,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employment benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies are successful and companies prosper if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employees’ commitment and commitment to the company, it is no wonder that there will be a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data about employees’ satisfaction.
But the data itself is ineffective unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requires feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“When you’re asking for 4,000 opinions, you’ll have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, consulting director at Kotter International, who was a witness to many companies that too much relied on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you do not reach the end, the employees begin to ask themselves the question: ‘Have they heard me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should it interest me?”
Madison Reed, which is now conducting regularly every month surveys among employees, can tackle Glinta to solve the problem within one day, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gets a very important look at its employees and hopes that in the long run it will high employment in a industry known for its frequent dismissals.
“If you don’t strive to create a transparent working environment, employees will not trust you,” Vitrano added.
And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the flow of customers, the whole company is bankrupt.”
Thursday was the warmest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnica na Hodonínsku, is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees Celsius.
This was by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Unlike Tuesday, there were no high temperatures.
The weather hit mostly Moravia, mostly cloudy in the Czech Republic.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations over the past 30 years were recorded.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measurement stations recorded.
The current temperature was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednica on Břeclavsk today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four decades of degrees and in Pohořelice on Brněnsk the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three decades.
Both records, as well as the Guardian, came from 2013.
Today, high temperatures have occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnica, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice on Znojemsk and Brodě nad Dyjí on Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the contrary, for example, in the western and northwestern Czech Republic, according to the website of the Czech Republic, today's highest temperatures were around 22 degrees Celsius.
“Temperatures began to rise until this afternoon,” the meteorologists said.
The current rainfall in the Czech Republic will gradually decline and more significant rainfall could come on Sunday.
In most areas of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in Southeast Moravia and on Saturday.
There was such a dirty thing here.
The billionaires do not have the same vote in the elections as every one full-year-old man in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva together with other co-workers behind the water Martin Burda and Antonin Frych sponsors Robejškovy Realists.
The Second Life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The corrupt man and king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, took over the Party of the Private.
The Political Movement of Agrofert, as the project of Andrey Babiš unwantedly named by the Kroměříž mayor Jaroslav Germec, is a chapter for itself.
A billionaire has been arrested by the mayor.
It is Dalibor Dedek, the owner of the Jablotron security facility company.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The entrance to the mayor's dress did not succeed.
“I’ve never dreamed of small goals,” he said at a press conference.
That is, my goal is to make the YES movement, to make the Mayor’s movement win twenty percent in the elections.
Leckdo laughed.
The grandfather’s discourse is rather characteristic.
The billionaire Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to apply for the votes of the voters in the Dresden of the Mayor, he continues to support Andrey Babiš.
His grandfather supported Babiš in the past parliamentary elections.
“Babiš is not a sharp speaker and does not govern the pleasant rhetoric of political snakes,” he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he doesn’t go into politics because he wants to improve personally.
My grandmother will be a hero.
He is willing to get out of his world that he has under control, and do something for us all.
Shortly after the Mayor introduced him as a new reinforcement, he recognized his admiration of the grandmother again.
And he said he wants the mayor to learn how to imagine a possible collaboration with the grandmother.
Some may appreciate that the Grandfather doesn’t change his views and stands behind him regardless of what dress he’s just wearing.
Others may speculate whether the Grandmother sends to the Mayor to build his beacon of someone so immobile.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron and the head of Agroferta did not break in the bad deal and does not look for a different way to defend his business rival.
The first public speech was not just about the grandmother.
He promised to send 10 million dollars to the mayor.
If they need more money, they will send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop this statement.
On the other hand, the judgmentally recognized gauner Zdeněk Bakala before the 2010 elections threw millions on all parties.
The political division of the security agency Vita Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civil Democrats have come together to thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits any party to give more than three million dollars.
When the Grandfather entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
You may not have to ask why the politics have such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics then Dedek crowned with a proposal for tax benefits to families with studied children.
People with higher education will receive about 50,000 a month.
Based on less than twenty.
A man with 50,000 is rich in this situation.
One with twenty poor.
In the Dad's vision of society, the poor fairly pay taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits arising from the functioning of a social state in which they don't take much part.
Wealthy people need to help to avoid poverty.
The mayor can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and the grandmother can multiply their hands.
We others, and thanks to the Grandfather, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains who to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of a state have not for their employees and the country for their property.
And ultimately those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling property is sometimes not easy.
And many times he will not help even 11 bedrooms, wonderful sea views, or the fact that the property is sold by U.S. President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by incredible £8 million.
This was by the Mirror.co.uk website.
In the brochure about the land is written: "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Go to a place like no other.
But even the association of the real estate company with the U.S. president did not bring an extreme price rate.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean headquarters by incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex is about as much as 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there is nothing to surprise.
The charming 5-acre settlement on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
There is a pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm on the ground.
From the terrace is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculations, he paid about £15 million.
The property was purchased for the purpose of rental.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin Island.
But with the new price, they are on the second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA decided to finish with two exercises a day. For Bruins there are long days
It is about 11 a.m. and U.S. football players at the UCLA University catch on the side line of the new school field.
Some of them wear their t-shirts and reveal a spotted back, a false sign of the first day of the training camp.
For the majority of the members of the team these few minutes of doing nothing supplays a lunch break.
Players registered in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training to study for the final exam before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that will be held next morning at 6:30.
“For these boys, the next three days will be a good match,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said a while before Monday was overwhelmed on Tuesday.
By terminating two workouts in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players — paradoxically, the workouts are even longer — at least until Friday, when the final tests end.
That’s why UCLA’s first three training sessions are scheduled at 19:15 – to get into the already so overwhelmed diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent in a Westwood coach position, the Bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year and the training is limited during the summer semester.
A total of eighteen trainings are scheduled for August 20, with the formal preparations for the first match against Texas A&M, which will be held in September.
Mora was told to support the decision of the NCAA, even though it added another item to the already so loaded player diary.
“Three or four days are the players under great stress and it’s very exhaustive for them,” Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone is trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will be calm.”
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the bright lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking area and the luxury Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective network behind the goal strip.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
“The ground will be monitored by the security service,” Mora added.
“The safety is cared for, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
This material is handled well.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by the guard, as well as the parking lot number 8.
We will make maximum use of our resources.
I hope everything will go well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook plans to further check facts to limit the number of fake messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties to check and display findings under the original posts in an effort to fight the so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxs, which will be sent to third parties to verify and potentially display the survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news and many believe that these unconfirmed news have affected the last year’s U.S. presidential election.
French voters are flooded by the lavines of fake news about the May presidential elections and Germany plans to impose a penalty on the social media network before the September elections if they do not remove angry posts quickly.
In a statement released in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it is planning to test a new fake news control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” said Sara Su, Facebook’s product news manager.
She added that Facebook continues to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creation of a graphic novel: A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group and found its shelter in it by Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, was a witness from his comfortable place near the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, to 700 years of stormy history that inspired the curved Jamie Rhodes of the York County – known for his interest in historical documents – to create a graphic novel.
“The sight of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documentes the lives of families who lived in the Castle of Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it’s not the first Rhodes’ book inspired by the archives: it’s also the author of Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library’s documents – a project that was very emotional for him.
“I was fascinated by the fingerprint on the letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites,” he said.
“This is his fingerprint.
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at that time you had to burn a candle to read.
When I get to the letter now, 300 years later, it’s like I’m back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle for four months is almost a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, browsing the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyena on the wall and the bottles that have been thrown for centuries in the hole.
He walked through the land and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked with the hats, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
In the evening, he “dry whiskey and wrote.”
Scotney's confidential history is relatively large unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to the documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the employees just began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries are throwing their hands with the words, ‘Take it into the roof.’”
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing the property: “You may think that the dispute about the land is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I’ve met one case when two families struggled about the bridge.
Let the people go!”
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and go deeper into English history, including the story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
“I found a record of the 1380 castle rebellion, which was in a book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes said.
“The English rebellion actually started in this area and I thought that the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it’s somewhat connected.”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest, which was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly filmed his own funeral when he filled the roof of stones (which was discovered up to a few years after the roof was discovered).
Rhodes' favourite family is Darrell's: "I was interested in the male generation - the men at that time were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family resolved this by marrying wealthy or old gentlemen—I imagine they were beautiful gentlemen who liked the heads of the inheritors.”
With the end of his stay in the castle, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week station in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
This is a special place for Scotney.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I said to myself, ‘Now I want to go back to real life.’”
Washington Changes Conditions for Green Card
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump on a new U.S. immigration plan, which will also lead to a change in the granting of the Green Card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to decrease by 50,000 per year due to stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The draft law will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will give priority to English-speaking applicants who are filled with funds and will demonstrate the capabilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a news about the technological development of sex robots will appear on the internet.
Yes .
Sexual robots are very popular today.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to the words of former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the brushes and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“People get out of them, but sales are growing and we have to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual helpers are transformed from infusing pan to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch – of course, artificial intelligence, which imitates man’s behavior.
The user can “repair” the robot to his own image – from the color of the eyes and the shape of the brushes to the appearance and color of the nails.
Of course, it is very worrying that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame even the Stepford lady.
Modern infusion virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the robot RealBotix can set different character features to his replacement woman, including shamefulness.
And then there is the sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, which is delivered with pre-programmed personalities, including the “frigid Farrah”, which is characterized by a shy nature and the “wild Wendy” with a “adventural” nature.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to fit your personality as much as possible,” True Companion’s website says.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
It’s very humorous, just like people.
It can be tired, talking, or being “in mood.”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for a number of reasons – among which it does not include confusion for real interpersonal relationships. Worrying are rather subordinate female character features and violent insights – for example, frigid (read resistant) Farrah.
True Companion on its website simulates Roxxxy to a male vibrator.
“When a woman can have a vibrator, why should a man not have a Roxxxy?”
Sexual robots, however, are not just a fetish or sexual aid.
Their appearance and almost perfect sophistication indicate something darker and deeply rooted in our culture – a disconnection from ideal or gender equality towards the desire for submissive sex with a optional attraction.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots still remain on the edge of public interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set to the present modern time.
And most people are not strange or violent until the free market gives them an excuse.
It is not an accident that these sophisticated sex robots appear in a time when women around the world gain their rights, and in the White House a president is sitting, who often expresses himself to a woman very shy.
The most terrible aspect of the series The Story of a Servant is not what we see - hanged bodies and scattered eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The story of a servant represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should look as much as possible like real women (although with the measures of porn actress).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They cannot separate with their partner or simply leave.
They have no work or history; nothing that would stimulate their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The word of the 21st century: Servant.
The NBA star on the green.
Curry fights in California for cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite the spaced first blow at the premiere start among professional golfers, did not lose.
The double winner of the award for the most useful NBA player played on the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour tournament in California's Hayward the first round of 74 runs and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second NBA title with the Warriors in this season, started very nervous and his first drop ended in a drink hold in a golf wagon parked at the fairway.
Even after that, though he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, he still left a dozen professionals with a balance of four runs over the pair.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, you had to call the judge immediately after the first break, but then it was a little sedle," Curry said with the fact that a huge threshold fell on him.
It was a lot nervous, shooting the first blow at the tournament, but it was all I hoped in.
“If you told me I’d play 74 in the first round, I’d take it immediately,” he added.
If Curry succeeds to fight with a cut that is likely to be set two wounds under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better the next time and now, when I get rid of the tremors, it's probably going," said an enthusiastic golfist, who has already played in the past at celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
He starts for the first time at a PGA tournament in Hayward.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsor exception andined an amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump’s great victory?
In contrast, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of healthy reason.
The unfake sign of the Trump era becomes political divisions that divide American voters and, in a micro-scale, breaks the whole families.
During the time of Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspapers were heated with advice on how to consult with relatives who choose Trump.
We’re just waiting for the nerves to allow us.
But less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to shake the family.
I’m talking about it because this week I was visited in New York by my cousin – a poet and fan of the left, who lives in Chicago and who has long paid for a Republican fool in our family.
She reminded me that face-to-face blindness to a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly, the whole family – including all the Republican brothers and sisters, with whom she has been hassling about politics for many years – is on one wave.
When dinner at a family table, it’s a good thing; but I’m surprised that in a wider context it represents a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we’re talking about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the scary possibility that his shaker can one day lose at attractiveness.
However, there is an even more horrible long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mit Romney and his version of mad behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we had awareness of his tax declaration) - of which both examples appear in comparison with Trump as very mild transactions.
After Trump’s departure, it is enough that the subsequent Republican candidate be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We took advantage of the visits of my cousin and took the children to Central Park to the largest tour operated by the New York Park Department – for your three dollars you won’t find a better use if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the central valley is covered with a glass - the clowns and the animals are filmed and in horrors look at their own shoulders - a completely cloudy look and cinking music strangely reminds the public transportation.
Many cliffs soon get bored: a view from the height buildings, a panoramic look, instead of breathing you with the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not come to your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn’t move over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss cheese – not counting the theme bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage – but the metro station in London.
The Central Park ride, however, triggers a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, are greatly entertained on it.
If I could evaluate the wheel, it would deserve the maximum points. but, fortunately, no one asks.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale from one to five when I paid with a credit card.
In the cafe in the corner of my street, it’s the same, with the difference that I can get to the rating 15% spropitné for something I’m buying behind the pult.
Not only does it slow otherwise fast sales, but the servant is forced to get into the benefit of the buyers when it is not necessary.
A woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I unwillingly assessed my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital due to chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to the hospital.
Last year he was treated for cutting wounds on the wrist, which he, according to the prison, caused himself after he fell in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original sentence for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning on Valentine's Day in 2013 with several shooting wounds through the door of a toilet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistaken her with the thief.
The prosecutors announced their intention of re-appellation, this time against the six-year punishment of Pistorius, which, according to their words, is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
In case of success, Pistorius is threatened to extend the sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in prison, a panda, who broke up in the wild.
This is a huge success for the pand rescue program.
The centre is trying to expand the genofond pand of prisoners.
A Chongqing center employee told New China agency that the pand is at a high risk resulting from a relative cross.
Only 471 pands lived in prison at the end of last year.
There are only two thousand survivors in the wild.
The attempt to break the captive pandas with the wilds is the first step towards helping the pand to protect this species.
The fifteen-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the natural reserve at the beginning of the pandia pairing period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
She met Cchao-Chao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the pandemic man lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because the pandy men are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal empire.
Men rather badly estimate the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and don't know what to do.
The young man was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, he weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians Arrested For Illegal Camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement was quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on August 1 in the morning by the Sithonian police.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the rules of free camping and imposed strict penalties on anyone who is arrested in a place where camping is not permitted.
The tests will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
After the first round of the British Open, Spilková ranked 50th.
Golfist Klára Spilková figure after the first round of the British Open on the 50th place.
The square in the Scottish Kingsbarns surrounded the score one blow under the pair when she played three times birdie and twice bogey.
The twenty-year-old Czech player has the hope that the famous major will go through a cut for the first time.
The competition with a $3.25 million grant came out best to the American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the record of the 64 runs, namely eight under the pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are removing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has closed 180 bird farms due to the incident.
The Netherlands Food Safety Surveillance Authority (NVWA) has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Netherlands poultry farms, which means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are harmless.
The agency stressed that the risk constitutes only a limited number of types of eggs identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in the eggs is small and does not pose a danger for adults, but a potential threat is for children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also approached the closure of farms, were not imported to the Czech Republic recently.
Veterinarians, however, will take samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on the markets of which problems of insecticide have appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and egg from the Netherlands for the last time in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is a part of preparations against bleachs, all and clusters.
However, it should not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and swelling.
Riga is wonderful, I will miss it, says the goalman Farmers and is looking for engagement.
I want to catch 10 years.
“Maybe I’m going to go back there one day,” a 27-year-old farmers laughed, who could start the season in the Zlinsky dress.
It depends on whether you will get an engagement before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it as in school, so for three.
The first year I did not take a lot, I had an experienced goalman.
I learned.
The next year I started catching.
Before the third season I thought they gave me more space.
But they brought a new goalman, with whom I changed again.
Last year, I thought I would keep going.
But during the first ten matches we only five points, so the coaches started to turn.
At the end, my colleague got more.
But so it is done.
They wanted to play for the next season.
How was life in Rio?
Beautiful .
It is a small Prague.
A beautiful, historic city.
I will miss.
I found a girlfriend there.
We are married for the next year, we are married for the next year.
I brought something.
How hard is KHL for the goalkeeper?
The first 10 teams are very good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who against them have to change their game style.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means to play more back, to fight more.
I didn’t see any problem in the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Did you not have a problem traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If a person has no family, it is not a problem.
He can sleep calmly.
The program is usually done so that you play four matches outside and then you have two days of vacation.
How do Latvians see their club in KHL?
as a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Fandy all.
Although it failed, a lot of people went.
Did Dinama’s action in the KHL help Latvia to almost go to the quarterfinals at this year’s World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there from the beginning.
And from the same time, their results at the world championship began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
This was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are going to the Czech extraliga.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts was promoted, and before the contract was signed, Ralfs Freibergs.
Why are so many of them here?
They’re not a big player, they’re really good.
Here teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It is a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still uninterrupted?
At the beginning of February I knew I was not going to go to Rio.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn’t have a budget for the goalman, we didn’t agree.
It was a classic.
We played with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I’m training at home and I’m going to wait for something to appear.
Are you not nervous about it?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn’t know what was going to be.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after some time.
I’ve got something in KHL, so I’m taking it differently.
The question is when and where I will sign.
How real is the possibility that the new year will be opened?
Anything can happen.
We will see what will happen in the next month and what will happen.
I can only wait for what the agent will say.
Do you prefer a competition?
The last season was not that I could choose.
I wait for the phone.
The government’s flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article S care of a regular farmer? among other things, about the camp in Letech u Orlíku.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will let the main paragraphs of the article remember.
The camp in the years has been spoken for many years.
For readers who don’t know exactly what it’s about, it’s probably the best to look at the official website of the Cultural Monument of the Southern Place of the Flight.
There, at the beginning of the historical review, we will learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Leta, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a Zigeun camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp including unhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
In total there were 420.
It is a very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, which was caused by human beings and the devastated ideology.
There is no dispute about the need to constantly remember these events.
There is no controversy even about the fact that this memorial should be held at the monument in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 70s of the 20th century a pig was built near and on a part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and in 1995 a monument was discovered in the years.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and destroy pigs, but so far it did not happen.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 it has been administered under the Memorial of Lidice.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig.
So very brief facts about the after-war fate of the camp.
In the autumn of last year, the government approved the purchase of pigs and decided to prepare an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the government will then buy pigs.
According to Minister of Culture Hermann, “some numbers exist, but I’d probably melt those intentions if I went to the public with them.”
We will see what the expert assessment will bring.
According to some informal estimates, it can go about hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
In any case, it will not be a cheap thing.
Only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state invested ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is apparently not a danger, it would, in my opinion, be a throwing of money.
Does the government have other priorities?
The monument, a decent southern place, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has occurred, and whoever wants, can worship the memorial of the suffering and murdered.
I don’t see any reason to change this!
Let it be as it is, and keep the southern place with maximum care.
About the assets entrusted, i.e. the money of taxpayers, the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should treat the care of a regular economist.
At least as in your own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But I still perceive from the point of view of the above facts the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as a empty pre-election statement.
This year, in May, I went to see the site.
Very decent arrival road, modified parking, replicas of wooden camp bars.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with flowing water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and with views of its own southern place, which is made of stones placed in a mild curve.
A lot of flowers and flower.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place, how good it is and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible, for example, to preserve some of the foundations discovered and to make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is what the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman said.
If he succeeds in the government to impose the purchase of pigs for state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic function as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve symptoms of inflammatory intestinal disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the real opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve from the symptoms of inflammatory intestinal diseases.
Untreatable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million inhabitants in the U.S. and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes stomach pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptofan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support the intestinal resistance.
The study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestine and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the tables of weight tend to the side of inflammation, inflammatory diseases of the intestines can occur.
As part of the research, scientists found the presence of immune cells that support the tolerance of the body in the stomach of mice with a specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan to form cells - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one kind of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the more the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells.”
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of the L. reuteri bacteria and a tryptofan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, as part of the study of a certain type of body intolerant immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice breeding separately cells lacked.
It follows that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbioma - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse’s intestine was tested by the DNA classification method and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mouse with immune cells that were missing by the second group of mouse.
The mice, who were lived in a sterile environment and had no intestinal microbioma—thus did not develop this type of immune cells—the L. reuteri bacteria was given—and they created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultivated L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid it was shown to be a side product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptofan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep the L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the side-products of tryptofan from the L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the triptofan-related genes have been detected in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Everyone of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of the L. reuteri bacteria can increase the cell population.”
José Mourinho says signing the contract with Neman Matić and his transfer to Manchester United is “genial”
Manchester United gained a "genius" in his team in the form of Nemanja Matiće - at least this is what José Mourinho thinks after his backing debuted on Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a contract for £40 million, said in the first match with a win 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and influenced his role as a backback alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereir.
However, since he did not participate in the pre-season Asian tour, Matić had no form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said it is necessary to work on before the start of the next Premier League season.
“He takes time, but he’s experienced, intelligent and has genius thinking – he’s thinking football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him get into condition as soon as possible.”
Like Matić, his new colleagues Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleven for the next season.
An independent source said this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fantasy job" and brought into the team three of the four most important players.
“Thank the club for helping me get three out of four players,” he added.
“Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken leather Ladi Hrušky.
He wants a lesson from Gustav.
This promising picture began to draw thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdeňkova Academy.
He immediately closed the chance.
"Dear Zdeňku, I would like to sign up to your cooking academy with this, because you, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on the social network.
And since these two have been on top for a few years, Lada has not forgotten to irritate him even this time.
“In return, I can teach you Znojemskaya from dietary chicken meat, American corn, or invite you to water and show you why it’s the favorite fried cheese,” Hruška said.
He really thinks seriously about his participation in the Pohlreich's new show.
It is time to move up the level and learn from the master.
“The question is what the boss is doing,” he said to the Lightning.
Pohlreich did not express himself because he filmed new parts of his next show Yes, boss!
To the participation of Hruška in the culinary academy only Prima responded with the fact that the whole matter is taken as his personal activity that goes outside the television.
Hruška Pohlreich sinked a big blow in December 2004 with his first cook.
In a few days it sold over 300,000 pieces.
The new program, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme, is a non-false cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his students from the audience and in twelve pieces introduces them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now Cooking boss in November 2014, Zdeněk left the back of his trick to gather a broken grape.
If I had my face there, I would laugh a lot.
"On that grape I just smile - grape is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Lada replied.
They think of the culinary art.
“To cook according to Ladi Hruška doesn’t come into consideration at home, because I don’t let the gastropunk go home,” the boss is clear.
I’m very pleased with the chicken, even I’m making a chicken on honey.
In my show, however, his recipes will definitely not appear," Hruška did not forgive.
It is stupid!
He’s not a chef for me, he’s a TV clown.
"Gastronomickej analfabet or fool," Pohlreich said about Hruškov at one lecture.
“I’m not twenty years old to be able to put my hands on them, but I don’t resolve them anymore,” Hruška said.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by mounting
The British inventor became the first man in the country with a microchip right into the body. By simply swinging his hand he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-year-old Steven Northam has placed a small chip to be implanted between the inch and the indicator and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
The process of implantation and compliance with the treatment procedures is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam also offers a service for the exchange of microchip-compatible door locks and cars. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child has allowed the technology to be integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple hand.
The White House recruitment cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly the Navy's helicopter to South Lawn on the occasion of the celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came to $24,000, according to the Navy's records, published by the weekly newspaper TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called the Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the peak of the program of July 17 in the White House, which was a show of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several White House senior officials watched the product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was exposed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car and a vidlicious lifting wheel from Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of a “extraordinary” event, the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for managing the helicopter.
“I wanted to make sure you are aware of such a significant event,” HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his supreme, the representative commander of the Navy for Aviation day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at about 7:00 p.m. on the occasion of the show, which is scheduled to start at 15:00 p.m. and will remain on the site until the full cleaning of the entire place, which was scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m.
The e-mail also stated that if there is a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working hours regulations.
The original crew remained on the site that evening along with the helicopter and together with them a security unit.
From the records - obtained by the TIME Weekly - it was not clear if the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records suggest that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
“We were interested in whether it was a Hatch Act breach and we were assured that everything was okay,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you’re blocked,” the commander’s representative wrote.
This “Made in America” show was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtext.
During his participation in the events, the president promoted the health reform, which passed through the Senate, and talked about an effort to keep the government’s regulations on the ground.
Using aircraft such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely due to presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential aircraft went back in the background at his first meeting in the framework of the campaign in Melbourne, Florida. his Twitter account is filled with complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
“The White House is pleased with the ‘Made in America’ show, which presented products from all the 50 states that Americans manufacture from American materials,” said deputy secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landing in Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings near the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current crew training, the state official said.
The helicopter unit on the same day landed another eleven hours as part of the “non-Presidential support missions”.
The White House said there were no additional revenues paid from the taxpayers’ money.
The spokesman Sikorsky said the company was in no way interested in negotiations on the exposure of a helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and the accurate cost related to the show is hard to determine according to the maritime statement.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hour price for the fiscal year 2017 is $24 380 per flight hour.
The unit records indicate the time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are significantly below that amount.
“Telling the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for expenditure refunds is very misleading,” said Walters.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD expenditure refunds do not include cost per person, but include fuel price, maintenance and contractual costs.
The White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the purposes of the show.
“The idea of the show that takes place this week is to introduce products manufactured in the US,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to the defense of our country, and of providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, in the production of which countless American citizens are involved.
This fact is to be remembered.”
It is not clear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his tour in South Lawn. With certainty, it can only be said that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire cars.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky’s representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I own three.”
A young woman was bound in a bag near the Lake of Mách, and the police broke to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2 p.m.
Instead of bathing, she remained imprisoned in moisture.
When she decided to ask for police assistance by a mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the police soon lost their connection with her," police spokesman Ivana Baláková said.
A few police guards went out to the place she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
“Some of the police officers had to browse with rocks moisture hundreds of meters before they felt a solid ground again under their feet,” Balakova said.
And in the same way she was missing.
The police were oriented according to which direction the call for assistance came from.
"In order not to get out of at least this connection, they agreed with her that she will count out loudly," the spokesman said.
Police found the woman only at three quarters on five in the basement in Borný.
She was at the edge of physical and mental strengths and showed signs of undercoldness.
The ambulance was taken to the Czechoslovak hospital.
The grandfather’s connection?
The desired bride becomes a selling girl.
This is a little irony.
With his web project searchameslusny.cz as if a billionaire in essence told the voters that the STAN is suffering from the deficit of decent people.
And he also stated that the politically unconforming party of less-known mayor and independent, in fact, has no national program for parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate simply after an interview with the Grandfather becomes a decent person, no matter what political opinion he has.
Once upon a time, it started like this, and it didn’t happen very well.
With his pursuit of decent people and personalities, which will eventually replace some of the mayor's candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, Dedek also ruins the popular argument of the head of the STAN that the greatest value of the movement is politically checked and experienced the mayor, traditionally the most popular politicians and according to the surveys.
They are now calmly replacing rapidly gathered unknown personalities.
The total breakdown with the people, after which the STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained also by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if STAN of identity was suspected by a few, after the arrival of the Grandfather, the game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík long defined himself against ANO Andrey Babiš, but on the first joint press, Dedek, who publicly praises Babiš, said as follows: "My goal is that the ANO movement, i.e. the Mayor's movement gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
I hope you have not mistaken the movement.
The grandfather is a successful entrepreneur and a billionaire is not an accident.
He often speaks about politics like Babiš, but unlike him he does not build his own political mark.
STAN has been reminding a reality show for some time rather than a real political party, and Dedek's help hand is as if the desired bride is even more making a selling girl.
For some time STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people, and now for change he is looking for decent people.
I hope someone will call.
Police dogs trained with helicopter on the bridge
Dogs specializing in explosives search and search dogs today exercised on Lake Bridge flying with a helicopter.
The police dog should not be scary and be afraid of flying, said the head of police kynologists of the Usteck region, Peter Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the Bridge, both adult training dogs and those who are just going through the training were exercised.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the lost figureant, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in a helicopter.
Soon, as soon as a helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter journey.
"The helicopter arrives, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tomášek said.
A dog who is anxious or is unable to work immediately after a helicopter is dismissed from training.
"Most of them are then left by dogs, for example, in the garden," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specialties.
The German shepherds dominate, but the Belgian shepherds are also increasing.
The dog cares for him from the puppy.
"He is raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal is undergoing repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal possible health disorders.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he makes the first tests in 20 months.
“It is about two and a half to three years,” Tomášek added.
The length of the service depends on the health of the dog.
It usually serves within eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.

According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
The elections can be credible only if all members of the society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Assistant Mission said that the local parliamentary elections are attended by hundreds of women, three women candidate for the post of vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and reliable only if women and all related processes associated with elections are involved.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has published several threats against the electoral process that moves international combat activity to the second round.
For the first time in this year’s elections, a democratically elected government is transferring its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique beer factory is cooking beer again.
A good beer in a rebuilt beer.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to life a beer factory in Lobči near Mšena a few years ago.
The beer factory first remembered in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was reconstructed to steam operation.
It followed years of flourishment, when the beer factory was famous primarily for dark beer.
During the Second World War, unfortunately, production was stopped and in 1984 the beer factory was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state goods.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the beer factory after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and broken into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes were bright in the form of new owners, architects Jany and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
Carefully dedicated and dedicated to the study of archive materials, seeking to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The beer factory has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the declaration of the beer factory as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction has also become part of the European Trails of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of drinking beer was restored.
To taste the great lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the outlet in the area of the beer industry.
When cooking beer here they use coconut water that comes from the protected landscape area, the slurry of the lobby fields and the grape chmel.
You will taste the traditional light bedroom, but also dark beer and specials.
And don’t miss the tour of the beer factory, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half the second.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia.
One of the greatest fortresses of its type in a global scale?
Such a unique building was the Stachelberg Fortress between Trutnov and Žacler, on the top of the ground back above the village of Babí.
It was originally made up of 12 bunkers connected by an extensive underground.
Here should be the command, the castle, the ammunition warehouses, the material, the power plant, the machinery and the hospital.
The construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single powerful iron-beton bunker was built and the underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association, who began reconstructing the unique building in the early 1990s, you can see this.
The underground is already available by 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73, with exposure and underground, there is also an armed object of light fortress, two built-in infantry fortresses, fortresses and the teaching path of the Fortified Trutnovsk.
Food, comfortable altanks and spectacular views to the landscape are guaranteed!
This unique and wonderful Czech building has come to the list next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Ninive and Nimrud.
Choteshov Monastery originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which today forms primarily the enormous four-wings building of the convention above the magnificent garden.
The list on which it got, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are at risk of disappearance.
But the enthusiasts don’t want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of the Evening for the Choteshov Monastery this Saturday of August 5, where Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas will stand, you will see the Shermyr show and you will look at the places of the magnificent extensive building, which are usually inaccessible.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Discover the plant by one click.
Students with the creation of herbars and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they just met on a walk, this application will advise them.
The only thing they will have to do is to photograph the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Bratislav Mountain Park in the framework of the Project The Secret Life of the City.
The project included students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with their teachers to the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, and thus increase the number of plants that the application can recognize.
“The children who hold a tablet or a mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest,” said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can within a few seconds recognize its name, which in Czech and Slovak will then be attributed to the photo.
The French authorized us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech in the Project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the application with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
“The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database,” Poláčková said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade unions are calling for guarantees from the McVitie’s cake manufacturer’s managers about a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company is still silent about any investment in the Tollcross area factory.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who manufacture, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said that in the previous years it has invested more than £5 million in the entire area.
She added that employees and trade union representatives will be “from the first informed” in case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the building manager, the Scottish trade unions of GMB expressed their concerns that McVitie’s “will not obtain its promises of financing and modernizing production lines.”
GMB’s chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we did not get a clear answer from the building manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the employees are mainly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where the work at the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the areas of high unemployment and social isolation.
From the point of view of labour, wages and profitability – and despite the prospects of Brexit, rising living costs and decreasing slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie’s.”
A spokesman for Pladis said: “The building manager Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
Regular meetings with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and this meeting openly discussed many issues.
We talked to employees that like in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In the last few years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and operational efficiency.
We highly appreciate the heritage of Tollcros and the sites here, and in case of any changes in the operation of the factory here, employees and trade union representatives will be immediately informed.”
PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in his attempt to get Neymar on his side after he deposited £189 million, the amount needed to rescue Neymar from the contract, but this French team warned Barcelona about his record attack three years ago?
The Ligue 1 club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's transfer to Manchester United, who paid for him £89 million last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after taxation, he will collect over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is angry with the way Neymar pulled out of his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted about this three years ago by the president of the PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we’ll reach one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face consequences.”
It seems that Barcelona crossed the imaginary boundary when it expressed interest in PSG Deputy Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG clearly expressed itself in the sense that under no circumstances it will not allow the Italian representative to leave. Therefore, it is possible that Barcelona for its troubled negotiations now with Neymar's departure sweets a bitter pill.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widespread rules?
Donald Trump has imposed anti-Russian sanctions.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China does nothing with the North Korean threat and that it will not continue to do so.
The idea of sanctions is like a slam from the shoes.
They cannot be thrown into one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela really started on the way to dictatorship, rather totalitarianism.
China does not act as the US president wants.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to summarize all of this so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or other, could understand what it consists in and what the system of rules the policy of sanctions is based on, the task would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump only quotes what President Obama has already prepared, just gave it an implementation seal.
So why such a turmoil?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump wins the U.S. elections, he will embrace himself with Putin and revoke the sanctions.
A terrible idea.
In practice it is the opposite.
With Trump, the sanctions are not released, but are strengthened.
Europe is scared even more.
German Prime Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions violate international law.
Is this just a sanction approved by the United Nations Security Council?
There are no anti-Russian sanctions.
European Commission President Juncker said Trump’s sanctions threatened the EU’s energy security.
It’s like to use sanctions just so weak that they don’t threaten anyone.
The ordinary voter.
Three years he heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk cessation agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known that it is about EU energy security.
The voter is wider and wider.
Russia’s sanctions come because it’s too much installed where it doesn’t have.
China is weakened because it is installed very little.
The Venezuelan president is punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their own rationality.
But do you see a system, a rule or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I am not thinking about cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossing the Republic with his visionary book and finishing the electoral program.
In addition to Paraguay, all the candidates are ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly.
He even agreed that this Moravskoslezsk will be led by the hejtman and shadow minister of education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of the parliament or hejtman," Babiš confirmed his earlier opinion.
Many representatives and national politicians were angry with their thesis that directly elected mayor and mayor should manage municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Do you think it seriously?
It was not so.
I am a favor of direct democracy, we vote directly for the president and I am convinced that we should also vote for the mayor and the mayor.
In my book I don’t talk about the disruption of the representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many will be.
When I presented your book About What I dream when I fall asleep, I heard on my own ears that you talked about the cancellation of the representatives.
I don’t remember that.
I was talking about direct elections and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor accuses himself of building little and not preparing large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same goes for the government, which in our history was ruled by only two people, Klaus and Zeman.
I don’t say they did it well.
The current Prime Minister does not govern anything, he only moderates the debate.
So it cannot work.
Do you want a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it’s hard to realize.
There is only a change in the agenda for a single round election to the Senate.
We also proposed a moving mandate of ministers and an amendment to the House of Representatives in order to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of parliamentarians who are to work mainly in the committees and committees, not to show themselves at the House of Representatives meetings.
It is definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
That’s what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the parliament with 101 members, abolish the provinces and the Senate, and through grateful mayor and mayor you will control the whole country.
That is not so.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of members.
French President Macron has announced that the legislative body will be reduced by one-third, with a total of 57,000 French citizens on one legislator and 17,000 Czech citizens on one-third.
But no one accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if in the Czech Republic someone won the majority elections, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
For those who have a parliamentary majority, it’s a lot to see in Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the event of the movement.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don’t understand why we couldn’t agree that only the wages of teachers, employees in the culture and social services would be increased.
Why were I voted over and added 21 percent to GIBS members who already receive 60 thousand?
Would you do that as a prime minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave economically, confuse the government with travel agencies, and for the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and soil in Africa.
The ministers do not have to argue in the government, the contradictions are to speak out of it.
The cabinet must go ready material, there is no place for coalition breakdowns, force voting and business, there is to decide.
How do you want a coherent team when the ministers behave mainly partially?
The constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to breaking the bread, Sobotka said the coalition agreement was not valid, and left Babiše from the government.
Every prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control abilities, such a flat gesture is not needed.
It measures everyone the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you want to be the Minister of Finance?
I don’t think about it at all, because we may not be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don’t know what terrible I’ve done.
So much skepticism is not in place.
The mayor got the entrepreneur Dedka, who would like to cooperate with you, with the people may win the wing of your favourite Jiří Čunka.
I don’t think that.
The CSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude the coalition with ANO, in the ODS may be prosecuted by Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not be against.
I would leave it on the voters.
Vice-President and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the momentowers come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he did not say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he was nominated as a doll Vita Bárta for the VV, then he gained money from Úsvitu for his company, a coup took place there.
He is, of course, a high personality.
Sometimes a bit naked.
If I take his program, then there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that can be agreed.
I am not asking you at all.
I wonder if it is acceptable for you a person who has xenophobic views, speaks on demonstrators with shabby and wants to leave the EU?
We don’t think about cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can’t imagine it.
It is clear that he went into politics to benefit from it.
And what is the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can’t imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the other in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the coalition government program.
Let’s go back to your effort to manage the state as a company.
But the government simply has to lead, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go out, never decided.
Coalition affairs like CEB or EGAP did not work.
For Sobotka is his doll, and that was, in my opinion, the reason he throwed me out.
As soon as he did, CEZ dominated the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the CEZ management, which orders to the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of the CEZ.
If you become a prime minister, will you change the personal relations in the supervisory board and exchange the top management of the CEZ?
Jesus, if I am a prime minister, I will see him.
I am not him yet.
It seems that the signals have already been sent to you.
A good cooperation with the CSSD would like to exchange for even better with YES.
After the election, everything will go on again.
I don’t know anything about it.
I have no humble or pink lobbyist, I am a separate unit and I do not solve this at all.
Answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of the CEZ, the Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, that is, the institutions you criticize?
We want a transparent society.
So far, he did what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
You have to look at Mr. Schwarzenberg’s statements.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, he has never led him, he was there only to the number, which is wrong.
This is a trivial matter for me.
CEZ has to take Dukovany, appreciate them, strike them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
The Czech TV?
Some of her programs against me lead a permanent target campaign, but I don’t have and I won’t have any competence to throw someone out.
To control yes.
I don’t want to control anyone.
I just say that citizens pay roughly 7.2 billion fees per year for public radio and television, but they don’t really know how these institutions manage.
Why they don’t know?
The House of Representatives approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer.
See how these news are discussing, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on the escapes from the investigation records and to the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he allowed Kalousk to push me out of the government, which played the TOP 09, but the CSSD took them.
They are afraid of the corruption of their corruption system, and thus they talk about the threat of democracy to Babys.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first Vice-President of the ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power background by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging a contract with the associate lawyer Květoslav Hlín with city and state firms such as the Prague Transport Enterprise or the Czech Railways?
We have a permanent dispute.
I don’t like it, and I accused him several times.
Faltýnek arguments by saying that the aforementioned lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I’t behave so.
I was not a finance minister.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílova, Březina.
If there were any signs of clientelism, we immediately throw out such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like that happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn’t matter who it would be.
