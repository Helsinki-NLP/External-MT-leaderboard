Welsh AMs are concerned about "looking like a fool".
There is a concern that some AMs suggest that their addresses should be replaced by MWPs (Welsh Members of Parliament).
It came because of plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament session.
AMs who are politically concerned can be funny.
One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it was dealing with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp is daft and pwp is poo.
Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but they found it was a short hop speech from MWP on Stupidity.
This letter in Welsh w is pronounced the same as the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the bill introducing the name change, said: "The final decision on all explanations by the Assembly Members is of course on the members' own behalf".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the proposed social consultation and received widespread support in calling for a Welsh Parliament meeting.
In the case of AMs, the Commission prefers Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP's support is best obtained through community consultation.
AMs are currently proposing other options, but struggling to get a grip on it could be a headache for Chief Executive Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a lawsuit for change within weeks.
The reform legislation includes other changes to the working arrangements of the meeting, including the non-qualifying AMs legislation and the drafting of the committee system.
AMs get the final vote on what to call the question when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the polls and vote to change the name of the country
Voters vote on Sunday and if their country's name is changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A popular vote was cast to resolve decades-old disputes in Greece's neighbourhood, which has its own special region of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern annexation represents its territorial claims and has repeatedly rejected its membership offers to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the direct vote on the name change, said he would not vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the ambassador Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is easier than the price of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Fall Silent parishes as Harlem churches struggle with
"Historically, the elderly have said that there was a section and a church in every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is none".
He said the gaps in the parts are understandable.
"People learn differently" these days, he said.
"The rooms are no longer living room neighborhoods where people go regularly".
Like the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
The churches, he added, should be replaced with floors of buildings that are full of people who don't help the other neighborhood animals.
"The expense of most people buying buildings is going to be clear", he said, "and so it's going to be a long day when these churches are going to be connected because it's unfortunate that most of these people who move into these buildings become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by the White Council before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Society in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The White Treasury meeting moved in the 1930s.
A black church worshiped near the building.
St. Martin was taken to a black meeting under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led a retail strike on Route 125, the Harlem public transit route, and denied black people rental or employment.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it, building it in a carillon.
The father of the boy and Johnson's successor at St. Martin's, the pastor David Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the carriage of the poor".
Taqasus, who played the carillon in the house, called it something else: "cultural assets" and "exchangeable historian's tools".
The scholar, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also found out that it was the first time an international carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a large carillon in the Riverside Cathedral 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't change him.
The expulsion from St. Martin's over the past few months has been a tough story for the postmen and contractors, some bringing religious leaders to the church, others to the Episcopal District.
The church hall - the parish priest who runs the church, is composed of religious leaders - is listed in the municipality of Lulia as "seeking to transfer expenses" to the parish, even though the church hall is not involved in the hiring of engineers and contractors sent by the municipality.
Some priests have been complaining about the lack of transparency in the local area.
A sea lion wounded a 13-year-old boy in California's eyelids.
A sea lion attacked and injured the 13-year-old boy on Saturday while throwing himself at a California bulldozer on the opening day of the bulldozer season, officials said.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. today near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was swimming with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then moved to the group to help them draw out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a pleasure to get a grip on the ego, but he later "knew he was screaming, 'I was kidnapped!
I have been robbed!'
The flesh is all over his shoulders", Hammel said, and he realized it when he went to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a sea lion in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was registered in critical condition.
The species of sea lion responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain of the Coast Guard Larry Giles told the media that sea lions had been spotted in the area for the past few weeks, but it was determined that they were not an endangered species of sea lion.
Giles added that the victim suffered horrific injuries to his shoulder area.
Officials have blocked access from the beaches of Ponto Beach from Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours of search and security purposes.
Giles found that there are more than 135 species of sea lions in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
The Sainsbury Plan pushed the UK into a beautiful market.
Sainsbury takes Buudad, Superdrug and Debenhams with a department store-style beauty route with special assistance.
As part of the key push they pushed the £2.8bn beauty market in the UK, which is growing steadily with the decline in sales and sales of home goods, the extensive beauty trail will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out to more stores next year if approved with success.
Beauty finance comes as a store hunting for the ways in which the space is used to charge for TVs, hot food and household goods.
Sainsbury said it's doubling its beauty size and offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Doctor.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands also have a lot of space with similar branded areas found in stores like Buffet.
The supermarket also restarts the decoration level of clothing stores so that most products are vegetarian friendly - sometimes more demanded from small shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Perfume Shop is testing the bonuses at two Sainsbury shops, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and shopping alternatives are available in all local convenience stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, said newspapers are watching the rise of retail as a major chain of stores tries to fight back against the deaths of Aldi and Lidl in many non-food services.
Sainsbury has been putting hundreds of stores in Argos newspapers and has also introduced several neighborhoods since it introduced the two chains two years ago, which says the sales of supported luggage made the availability of those that you would like to have a benefit.
The first attempt to renovate the supermarket and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury tested the risk of a drug in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after the line ended on how to separate the drug from the pharmacy's in the supermarket.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold its 281 pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded scale to beauty skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy with four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said: "We've changed the design and felt our beauty journey to enhance the atmosphere of our customers.
We have also funded colleges specially trained in counseling.
Our brand standards are designed to meet every need and the attraction of the environment and the appropriate facilities is that we are now forced to make the area a beauty destination that is contrary to the previous usage pattern".
Peter Jones' 'reward' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'Caro' after TV show Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their Truly clothing and other items.
In business, Gwyneth Paltrow loved the Goop brand.
The morning of the show, the 37-year-old posted on Instagram announcing she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' star Den, Peter Jones, showing their exit from the brand for their last-minute profitable lifestyle - to focus on her exclusive Marks & Spencer and ITV contracts.
Illo said Jones was "laughed" when the TV gold star admitted during a rally at the Vaccine headquarters of the business association in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - was advised that she would not once again have enough time to cut off the clothing and products of Truly brand.
The business was loved by Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow and was announced to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, posted on Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones flew to England to lead one of his vacation homes.
Illo said, "It's really way beyond Holly's priorities.
It will be its long-term future that can be seen for decades to come.
Her decision to leave left everyone involved completely shocked.
No one believes what happened to the vaccine, it was so close to the beginning.
There are a lot of stuffed cages at Marlow HQ ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of the Morning Show, one of Britain's most successful stars, could cut the company by millions due to heavy investments in products that replace swimming pools and candles for clothing and home furnishings, and the expectation of further delays in its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother-of-three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his ten-year-old wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby officially joined Truly and Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple's vacation with Jones holds a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby wants to be the brand agent for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's And I'm a Celebrity.
A close friend of Jones's said yesterday: "I would comment on his business affairs".
The hard line, "And then we fell in love".
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media and that some commenting would be considered "inappropriate" and being very positive about the leadership of North Korea.
Why was President Trump so disappointed?
Trump said in his joke "the funeral show" in the voice.
"I have not disappointed him in anything".
He found that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, and Trump praised it as a major step towards nuclear deterrence in North Korea.
But the nuclear treaty was cancelled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN's world leadership at the General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not seen a "corresponding response" from the United States until the previous disarmament moves by North Korea.
Instead, he found, the United States continues to impose sanctions designed to crack down on it.
Trump has taken a very optimistic view of his outgoing campaign.
"We're doing well with North Korea", he said.
"We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have this good relationship now".
He said his efforts to increase Kim's contacts have yielded positive results - completing the drone tests, helping to release prisoners and recover the remains of the US military who were sent home.
And he defended his unusual style in talking about Kim's relationships.
"It was easy to be a presidential candidate, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into his backed administration, we wouldn't have the equivalent of 200 people standing there", Trump said, referring to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's recent earthquake and devastating island earthquake, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no epidemic has been declared in the country, due to the international aid requirements.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international help, so it is a small obstacle", Ms. Sumbung said.
With Save the Children joining a travel team to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on site.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
The earthquake reportedly suffered in Indonesia in a consistent manner left the country in a state of disaster.
With the disaster shelter built in Aceh, it is not a typical area on the other side of the coast.
The absence of a visible warning bell in Palu, even if the warning would have been effective, probably contributed to loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make numbers even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was sent to Lombok to treat earthquake victims was heading for Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the other side of the problem.
President Joko Widodo made a breakthrough in Indonesia's devastated infrastructure in the central part of his election campaign, donating money to roads and railways.
But the lack of implementation was robbed by Mr Joko's administration as he faced re-election the following year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from the long-standing interests of the Indonesian group, where members of the majority Muslim population have taken a very captive approach to belief.
More than 1,000 people died and thousands were evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using swords, bows and arrows, and other hard weapons.
Dr. Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool has been deeply involved in his teaching and Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the 89-minute loss to English Premier League side Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri with about 30 laps to go from Chelsea's 1-0 win.
He hit the ball with his left hand before hitting the goal on the long side.
Try to travel above the box to the top right corner of the net.
The balloon immediately hit the side of the Kepa Arrizabalaga and hit the net.
"It was just trying to get to that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I tried to establish myself as much as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming up and he took one touch and I didn't think much of it, I just threw it away".
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-time after scoring the 25-minute goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The goalkeeper of the Balug followed Mateo Kovacic's back-up in that game, before moving to the midfield and moving on to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick-to-go delivery to the center.
He then threw a beautiful ball at him, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran out to the defense and completed the long net shooting that passed Alisson Becker to Liverpool.
Liverpool played Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's faces at Videoton at the UEFA European Championship at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia has reached 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has reached 832, the country's epidemiological agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and triggered night-time waves of 20 feet, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the reception meeting.
The capital city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was flooded with the ruins of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was shot dead
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with a gunshot wound at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police were arguing with people in the area who saw or heard everything that was going on.
Criminal investigator Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the first stage but I appeal to everyone in the John Street district of Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken all the camera footage to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know that the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she got this morning.
The police said the investigation is ongoing and that the next victim's relatives are being notified.
The taxi driver from Grayson Mews has tried to return to his apartment but police said no one was allowed inside or outside the building.
He was talking when he found out what had happened.
The guards are told to stay for hours until they are allowed to return.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now treated as a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the door.
She repeats 'it's too bad'.
At 2pm, two police cars were inside the forest and another outside.
The number of officers stopped inside the forest to monitor the road from the floors.
Anyone with the report is asked to contact DM @MerPolCC by calling 101 or contacting Crimestoppers on secret number 0800 555 111 by referring to the 247 entry number on 30 September.
The Cromwell Act of Parliament became the last memorial event with a 'rewrite of history' in the lineup.
Its punishment will be a poetic justice of the Taliban-like extermination of the predominantly English and religious traditions by the Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was more important than ever that the current debate on removing the statues in the Oliver Cromwell style outside the Palace of Westminster was the focus.
Neither of the British Civil War's objections were ordered or made by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been more wrong to follow in the footsteps of Thomas's ancestors in the last century.
Sir William Hamo, Thorneycroft's senior representative at Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century idea and the historical artistic component of the style that many believe is still to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told Sunday Fax: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps in the late 19th century, as the modern-day alternative, as a parliamentary defender against domestic pressure, in his plea for the state of the kingdom.
If this is the proper representative general, then the historical debate is ongoing.
What is certain is that something in the mid-17th century shaped the progressive evolution of our country, and Cromwell is a characteristic of the style that represents one aspect of the divide.
His achievements as God's Protector are also important to celebrate and remember".
Chinese Farmer Murdered Wounded Pig
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs at a southern Chinese meat market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only as his father "Yuan", was found dead with a severe, blood-covered appendix to the side of the pig room at Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared to inject hoggery vaccines into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reported that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to market 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and he found the door to the pigs' room next door open.
He said that inside the pig room was an adult pig with blood in its mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that 550 boars injured farmers, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood", the cousin, named after his father "Wu", said, according to the Guiyang Cemetery.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his cows.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killed did not have Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Makrib Cemetery that the pigs were detained to avoid attack on everyone, with police bringing them to the scene for evidence.
Yuan's family and the market authorities were reported to have discussed compensation for his death.
Although sometimes, the cases of pigs attacking humans have been written down.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, 650 pigs pushed a Welsh farmer to the point where he killed his wife.
After Oregon farmers ate pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not normal attackers but tasted blood and could act like "a monster".
"They're just playing a lot.
They're very funny, and very interesting... they're not there to hurt you.
You just have to give the right amount of respect", he said.
Hurricane Rosa is causing heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will slow its movement toward the water cooler along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is bringing floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 hurricane, as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move on Sunday.
At this time, an open wave is beginning to move eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja, California on Monday as a tropical storm begins to push the tropical moisture of the northern southwestern part of the United States deeply.
Rosa brings up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the humidity of the tropics through the open curve creates heavy rainfall that spreads to the southwest over the next few days.
In the environment, 1 to 4 inches of rain is a risk of limited flooding, waste streams and possible landslides in the desert.
The extreme heat causes rainfall levels of 2 to 3 inches per hour in the winter, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Mostly 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwestern parts, especially during the high season in Arizona.
Small flooding is possible in cases of emergency evacuation due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
She becomes seriously ill and is advised to leave the footsteps with a warm raincoat.
Heavy rainfall can cause rivers to rise and storms can cause strong winds and a breezy bus.
The upcoming open curve will bring strong rainfall to the coastal forests of Southern California.
Rainfall is more than half an inch possible, which can cause small amounts of garbage to enter the roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the wet season.
Some tropical rainforests begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more prevalent on Monday through Vaccino.
Heavy rain is spreading through the Four Corners of the Vaccination until Wednesday.
In October, it can see a rise in temperatures across the United States as the provinces get colder, but the heat gets warmer.
Sometimes this leads to large and short-term temperature changes.
There is a great example of a large temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
There are about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the heater will try to build and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm start in October with the 80s outbreak from the open areas of the South to the northeastern parts.
New York City has 80 percent of the vaccination rate, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates the possibility of high average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh audition.
More than 20 million people watched the seizure of evidence on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political process continued, and journalists inherited last-minute programs on Friday: an agreement by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and the FBI to conduct a single-step investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee to be 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was attracted to him by fear and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, a passionate witness, said he was 100% sure it wouldn't happen.
It looks like over 20.4 million people reported Nielsen watching Friday.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS News, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available on other networks that showed up, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually had little trouble estimating the number of people watching in offices.
To put this in perspective, the audience size is the same as the final football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, which hosts their ideas, strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, which led the network to 5.69 million viewers during the day-long audition, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest became high after the hearing.
Flake was the middle number in Friday's series.
After a midterms in the Republican office issued a statement that Kavanaugh would be voting for, it was captured on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning by protesters as he tried to enjoy the elevator of the Justice Committee hearing.
He stopped in the eye for a few minutes as he was growing up, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had made a statement saying, before the elevator closed, that he would like to say more at the board hearing.
The cable and media networks covered all of the live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's vote for the full Senate.
But Flake said he's only doing so on the understanding that the FBI is looking into allegations against the candidate next week, which the Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was sentenced in part to a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a few years of discussions with Coons and then Flake made his decision.
Flake's ruling was in effect because it was the Republican's insistence that he not get the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The UK Prime Minister could accuse the Brexit party of "playing politics"
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for a "game-making" policy on the future of Britain that threatens national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Congress of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview near the front page of her newspaper, her foreign minister Boris Johnson pushed back on his attack on what is known as the Brexit Chequers plan, saying the suggestion that Britain and the EU should collect taxes on each other was "absolutely nonsense".
Wide Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspect in the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and prepared for a second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, CBS said, according to WAFB allies.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His compensation was set at $350,000, the prosecutor reported.
The Office of the Investigator of the Eastern Baton Rouge Priest released a general statement on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department coordinates the Louisiana State Police Escape Force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and the Citizenship Area to assist with the investigation leading to the closure.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for "their commitment and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "horrified" by Wade's death.
"This is what you're always worried about", Wade says.
A volcanic lake is located in Mexico City
The eruption from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The Central Center for Epidemic Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to avoid the volcanoes after the operation escalated and 183 gas and gas industry fumes were recorded in 24 hours.
The centre was monitored by several sounds and vibrations.
Social media images show a series of brief sessions covered in car mirrors in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geologists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano in 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-north of the capital since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been in existence since 1994.
The police clashed with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence of Catalonia.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after political independence protesters were attacked by police, and hundreds of thousands joined the protests to mark the first anniversary of the vote for the secession of Catalonia.
The division team, masked by the back-to-back political division of the police, arrested them and threw eggs at the powder keg, creating dark clouds on the roads that are usually full of tourists.
Violence also broke out late in the day when police used their staffs to carry out the fighting.
For more than a few hours, political independence groups sang "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" in front of the protestors shouting, "Long Live the Night".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
The uprising is rising in the independent state, which is interested in a year later. On October 1, a referendum was declared illegal in Madrid but celebrated the secession of Catalans.
Voters were overwhelmed to become independent, and there were fewer in attendance than those who were strongly opposed to not going to the polls.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the early voting at polling stations in a violent conflict province.
The group's independence groups camped in the night of Friday to protest the protests in support of the national police.
The protests continued but were held in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the secessionist protests, said his wife did not hope for any further benefits for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year I lived in one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cheer with joy that they could vote, but now we're blocking them", she said.
Despite the key management if the electoral victory curve in the provincial elections of last December, Catalan political divisions have struggled to survive a few years with their leaders as well as whether to impose personal expulsions or to close the waiting court and their role in the preparation of the referendum and the successive declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records police-supported protests on his cell phone, said the riots were sparked by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting a little bit up and down", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison who has been on trial since the end of last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"The stagnation of the European elections is the best way to criticize the escalation of democratic values and the pressure we have seen on the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: A man was arrested after his home was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car crashed into Londonderry's home.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the doors and the self-building.
In some cases, the bow can also be thrown into the vehicle.
The Menga attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the win.
Livingston's surprise was raised when Rangers handed Steven Gerrard his second 18-game loss as manager of Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga attack proved to be as diverse as the move rate of Gary Holt with the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's side were on the losing side in the Premier League this season and faced the Hearts of Leadership, finishing eight points clear, the following Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers welcomed Rapid Vienna to the European team in the shirt.
Livingston, currently, has increased their unbeaten share to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to taste the losses since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is short of opportunities to challenge real guests.
Holt's team had to start the season before they were born, and the Rangers were facing all sorts of problems with the injuries.
Scott Robinson passed but put all his effort on goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only put his effort on goal after throwing in to face Craig Halkett in goal.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing they were harassing the guests in the assigned sections.
And that was the way the hard-core came about.
The Rangers received the call and Livingston worked on the opening, along with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who sent it to Menga, who took the touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that level, the Rangers took possession but found the home defense unchecked and the boxer Liam Kelly not heavily compromised.
This design continued in the second half, and alongside Alfredo Morelos he was able to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers, Allan McGregor and Lithgow moved on to another game hosted by Livingston.
Thieves were constantly coming to Livingston's box and it was always open, with both defendants claiming - after Halkett's replacement challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one of the admirers - that it was misled.
'Unusual' analyses - Livingston
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni area
A. Abnormal activity and Livingston's result.
And as for the man, they raised him up, and he continued to exceed the expectations of the highway.
Their style of play and staff have changed dramatically since their return from the war, but a great bridge goes to Holt, who has been pleasing the team since he arrived.
He has many heroes.
Captain Halkett was big, delivering a well-developed defense, with Meng holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes until the end.
The Rangers were not disappointing, though.
As good as they were in the times according to Gerrard, they were well behind those standards.
Their final h balloon was missing - only when they cut off the opening from the side of the house - and that was a catalytic call for the Rangers, who saw themselves at the center table.
Erdogan received a unanimous reception in Cologne
There were bright smiles and grey smiles on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have failed in matters of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new and large mosque there.
The capital is home to the largest Turkic community outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to evacuate 25,000 people who had gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters went nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-struggle protesters show the division of the guests they praised as heroes of the German Tarchiche and killed as other judges.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a London car crash.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy Deptford road, in the south-east of the capital, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the medical team arrived, but the man died on the spot.
An accident occurred months later when another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Road, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said the authorities were working to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Roadblocks and bus stops are in place and motorists are advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in a disorderly manner
Six prison officials were injured in the disruption of the men's high-security prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
A riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" officials were trained to deal with the disruptions, which involved eight prisoners on one wing.
Officials were treated for minor facial injuries on the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff were hired to deal with the ongoing incident by HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible are being transferred and can spend a long time in prison".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison cell phone operator receives hospital treatment after a prisoner is attacked.
And in October last year, the authorities were called to the prison to deal with the real disruption of workers by balloon attacks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, the capital of Salt Lake and minor flooding.
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's actually what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa drains the remaining energy across the southwestern Sahara, from the west, carrying the risk of minor flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set off a low-level flood watch on Monday and Monday in western Arizona south and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the capitals of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route to Phoenix for the Vaccination, arriving late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical storms have sustained tropical cyclones or levels of distress within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border".
The latest National Hurricane Center estimates 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, including figures up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern Sahara, including the Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to be 1 to 2 inches, with the total isolated to 4 inches.
For those without a low blood pressure risk, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing as the region is hit by a drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these rains are likely to be beneficial as the southwest now faces drought conditions.
According to the United States Drought Monitoring Bureau, as more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one severe drought, the second-highest among me", weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa leads to a downward trend in the entire Mexican state of Baja California.
Rosa, which still has strong winds on Sunday with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm stimulates the cooling of the Pacific basin and therefore strengthens it.
As a result, it is expected to be less intense on the Mexican soil in the heat of the afternoon or at dusk on Monday.
Rainfall in all parts of Mexico can be a burden, posing a risk of severe flooding.
"A rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected in Baja California in northwestern Sonora, and up to 10 inches", weather.com reported.
Rosa then flows north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in the early morning hours of Vaccinations as a tropical depression, then flows back toward Arizona and then into southern Utah during the Vaccination night.
"The most anticipated outcome of Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the United States.
Three rains are expected to produce small floods of life-threatening debris and sedimentation in the desert, and earthquakes in mountain debris.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted assassination
Three infants and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after 16 years of being found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The infant was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in "normal" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
The authorities appealed against anyone who may have a mobile phone for what happened.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering, ruthless, angry with the Democratic Party".
"Justice Kavanaugh's ruling is a voice for denying the wickedness and ruthlessness and misguided tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered from the ruthlessness, anger" of the Democratic Party to his election system.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday that he strongly and passionately denies the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her decades ago when she was a baby.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the amazing and quality and inspiration" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"The attempt to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's vote confirms one of the most successful legal minds of our time, the legal expertise of the social service money register", he told the West Virginia crowd of supporters.
The president directly referred to Kavanaugh's election by discussing the importance of the Republican rise in the midst of the election.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't run, but I do run", he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for top candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are the mission of "opposition and anti-communism".
The first vote for the Senate floor in Kavanaugh's presidency was expected to take place shortly after Friday, the deputy head of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the Indonesian earthquake, the eruption, and the growing vegetation.
At least 384 people were killed, many evacuated peacefully as a result of a massive wave that devastated the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesian territory of Sulawesi, the landslides were devastating on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the capital Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave hit a dark spot, causing many to die and destroying everything that comes before it.
The following is a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of the epidemic emerged yesterday, people were still doing their work on the beach and were not immediately ordered and became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian epidemiological agency BNPB, said in a statement.
"Tuzami did not come on its own, it pulled cars, records, houses, hit the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tusansami traveled to the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before crossing the road.
Some people climbed trees to escape the monsters and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were relocated to 24 centres in Palu.
The images of the antenna released by the pandemic authority showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges folded and destroyed and mosques were flooded.
After the shock, she continued on to the rock in the coastal capital on Saturday.
The effects of the earthquake were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technical Application and Assessment Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.
The geography of the capital, which is located at the end of a long, winding sea, may have the size of a tuscan, she said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, utility shops and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and damage could be significant in the cemetery woodland 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggala area, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The contacts "generally become disabled by lack of information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and specialists were heading to the affected area.
"This is already a shock, but it's getting worse", she said.
The authorities on Saturday were heavily criticized for not reporting the tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time of the warning.
Inside the scene, they shared on social media a man standing on the ground in the building can be heard shouting numerous warnings about the approach of the tusmanian to the people of the underground.
Within five minutes, the water wall collapsed on the beach, shying away from buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the sighting immediately.
The earthquake and the explosion caused a major power outage in the Palu area which made it difficult for the authorities to communicate with the rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other capitals for relief, authorities said, but the displaced still need food and other vital items.
The capital's Eiraboor has reopened only to fuel the efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was ordered to visit the rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's population has risen from 800.
How unfortunate!
With World Vision personnel arriving safely from Donggala to the capital Palu, while workers housing themselves in tents built on the walls of their office building, they overcame the feeling of road damage, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began their dirty movements to start the pandemic-overcoming garages, some felt that the deep-skinned foreign aid prevented the Palu journey.
According to Indonesian law, foreign funding, employment and employment can only begin if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
And it has not yet happened.
"It's still a pandemic at the state level", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open up international aid but there is no law yet".
As with the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those still missing hope that their relatives will be the miracles that caused the tragedy of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from the bladder.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national team coach, coached two missing scouts at the Asian Games, which were held in Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the others who were trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, Ms. Mandagi added, his student.
"As the head of the inspection department, I took my own personal responsibility", he said.
Mr. Gendon shared how, within hours of the wreckage of the Roa Roa Hotel, he shared some of the search community, sending WhatsApp messages with hope to the contestants in Palu, who were attending the beach party.
His messages, though, only caused one red-colored grave, instead of a red-colored grave.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered", he said.
The robbers took $26,750 during the refill of the Newport ATM in Levee.
The robbers on Friday morning stole $26,750 from Brink's ATM staff in Newport, Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment building and prepared for the delivery of a large amount of money, Food.
With her in the neighborhood, another man "run over the back of Brink's staff" and stole money for the delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, according to the release, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with an identity card should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The fans changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West's fans are changing his name to - Ye.
Announcing the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Being known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye and at one time used a moniker as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He changed the songs of Ariana Grande from the show to "for reasons of feeling", the band's founder said.
Like the abbreviation of his professional name today, West has already said that the word has religious significance for him.
"We believe 'yes' is the word used in the Bible, and within the Bible it is 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the title of his album hosted by the radio show Big Boy.
"When I am you, I am us, it is us.
He left Kanye, conscious of the meaning of being the only one, the only one -- being the showcase of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a great introduction to who we are".
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former Western correspondent, JAY-Z, also did the same without specifying or magnifying it.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use it for civilian military purposes.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use civilian military force as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody vengeance against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military force to oppress Mexicans".
The military fired at a peaceful protest on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing at least 300 people as the left-wing student movement was on its way to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open up more community colleges.
He said that the unemployment and education opportunities are comparing youth to gangster crime.
The United States should double the amount of AI funding.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on site research, says AI investor and physician Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made announcements about AI, and even in the US as a whole, there is no official strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it was recommended as No. 1 among AI innovations for 2030.
"Double-double AI research budget would be a good start, with all other countries being much behind the United States, and we are looking for rapid advances in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the grant could increase the chances of AI's next success in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has funded one of China's most popular AI companies, Face++.
During the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on AI systems that hit the top players in the US, Othello, and later served as Microsoft Research Director and President of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the US government's previous technical competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Challenge of the Robotics Agency and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next.
US researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the leadership in education; it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired universities to work with AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration law could also help the United States strengthen AI efforts.
"It's a real shock that the card should be given directly to PhDs in AI", he said.
China's provincial governments have developed the Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Association of China provides funding to people in educational institutions similar to the way the National Science Association and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of education work is inferior in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Intelligence Training Center, which was recommended to involve industry and education, and the Red House announced the establishment of the Selected Committee on Intelligence Training.
And this month, DARPA announced $2 billion in funding for the innovation AI Next.
As NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislature seeking to establish a National Intelligence Commission has not seen any action for months.
Voting by Macedonians in a referendum if the country changes its name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Saturday to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a step to resolve the decades-long conflict in Greece that has shut down its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a region called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name is not a territorial claim and has blocked its entry into NATO and the European Union.
Governments signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but a generation of oppositionists argued that the change would jeopardize the gender identity of the majority of Slavic Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not vote in the referendum and did not participate in the campaign, raising doubts whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 percent of the required working referendum.
The question on the referendum read: "Are you a member of NATO and EU with the consent of the Greek treaty?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the payment of its value follows the approval of organizations such as the EU and NATO in Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia to live freely and in harmony with the EU's demands because it is a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje.
Although I am not legally bound, enough members of parliament said they would abide by the vote to make a decision.
The change of name requires a majority of two or three seats in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of a 1 p.m. miscalculation bill.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change that opens the way for NATO and EU membership in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small level of elevation of seats in front of tents made by those who did not oppose the referendum.
"We want NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but you have no honor.
If they don't want to stay in Macedonia, we can go back to other people like China and Russia and become part of the Asia-Europe heritage".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership brings much-needed funding to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of just over 20 percent.
"We believe most people like it because more than 80 percent of our peoples want the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the result of "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Law Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a successful referendum to be held, it needs to be 50 percent and one vote.
The defeat in the referendum represents the first real loss to the Western government since the constitution was adopted in May last year.
Next: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City to the all-time goalkeeper for Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent the 2-0 victorious Manchester City defender Brighton to play Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made a simple 65-minute youth joke.
The Argentine goalkeeper has been given a bad start to the series.
He competed against three Brighton defenders before being knocked out in the open.
Aguero later found himself in four green suits.
He pushed the sides of one defender before scoring several more in the corner of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed the bus to his left, and he found Sterling.
The England striker used his first touch of the box to then re-screw Aguero's back ball, which used his right horn to hit Brighton's Mathew Ryan's right-handed throwing forward.
"Aguero is suffering from some foot problems", the capital's manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to him about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal in that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the advantage of the British Hotel in the war.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero found the balloon deep in the Brighton area that day.
He sent a beautiful ball-side with Leroy Sane's left shoulder.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to the long jump.
The Sky Blues striker hit the net ball before hitting a sturdy field.
City battled Hoffenheim against the European Championship team at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wanted to play spoiler and Rockies.
And for citizens who were eliminated from the debate about starting the game, there was not much reason to force another start.
But the pre-season Scherzer hoped to take a vacation Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies' influence still exists, said the lead single-game passer Los Angeles Dodgers of the NL West.
The Rockies confirmed at least a point of chance for a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to close their first half.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can push the known points that the atmosphere there in Denver with the crowd and the other teams are playing at perhaps the highest level of every club I'm facing this year.
Why would I want to compete for that?"
Citizens still have to announce Sunday's start, but there have been reports of a desire to allow Scherzer to throw such a situation away.
Scherzer, who is making his 34th start, threw out the pen throwing on Wednesday and will throw out his usual break on Sunday.
The right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 in each of these games.
Trump's march in West Virginia
The President directly referred to the situation in his High Court in electing Brett Kavanaugh, stressing the importance of the Republican rise in the midst of the election.
"All of the things we did in support of November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our time.
This is the big one, big -- I'm not really multiplying it, but I'm really competing for it, which is why I'm looking everywhere and fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You see that this terrible group, this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening now.
And they decided to take back their power using all the basic means, you see, ruthlessness, malice.
They don't have a job to hurt, who they have to go through to get power and accountability, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them".
Demography, he said, is about "rejecting and preventing".
"And you see that over the past four days", he said, calling the Democrats "we've been angry and ruthless and ruthless and haven't told the truth".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Democrat, as a nominee, which receives negative support from the audience.
"Remember to answer?
Have you deleted the document?
Uh, uh, what do you think?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever had".
The work is not a church.
It's impatient for people to talk about their minds.
When the fever movement in my local party voted to criticize me, it was hard.
After all, I'm the last of the Labour MPs to tell us we're not welcome - all those who talk about our minds.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan has received the same treatment because she has secretly stopped anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by a very strong committee for rejecting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic regulation, national security, in Europe, is reasonably similar to what Jeremy denied in his previous leadership.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be added and produced".
For most of my eight years as a Member of Parliament for Environmental Affairs, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, it's not the sound of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy that has long been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly intolerable that there are different views about the Labour Party and that every idea is judged if it can be accepted by the leadership of the party.
This said that after Jeremy became the leader, as friends I previously thought I shared the same political vision began my expectation of doing the Secession and taking a position that I never followed - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak openly - and I don't really care what I say - there is a rampant abuse on social media calling for an end to the election, criticizing the policies of the Centre, telling me that I am not a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my friends because of the comments I've been given that tend to be political.
I feel the professionalism and determination of those friends who face the abuse of discrimination and hate every day, but I was never ashamed.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this policy is how the rate of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is we are not a big church anymore and every "non-trust" movement or change in party electoral laws becomes a curve.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years that tells me to keep my head down, not to keep that voice and then "I'm going to be up all night".
But that's not what I entered politics to do.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, and the Thatcher government's negligence on my high school classroom has been declining, I've been looking to lead good social services for those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would be confused in any way about where we stand on the rule and the conflict area of the current leadership.
For those who are promoting the movement on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is turning to Brexit, that's hurting our families, businesses and social services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But I don't really have a message for Nottingham Momentum, it's my choice, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that not every number of threats to cancel elections or political motives will discourage me from doing what we believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Not to mention Ayr is going up.
A further two attempts may have significantly altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worthy of winning this amazing Tennent League game of the day.
Cousins are at the top of the chart, the only remaining top ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, like most of their good-hitting chances, which led to the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested on our game side so far, we're still not out of the game, so I should be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "At the point in Ayr, they took their chances for us to do well".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, replacing Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card of Scotland cap Rory Hughes, was suspended from the Warriors game, and Melrose was allowed to make the number prediction and Jason Baggot made an unchanged attempt.
Climo stretched Ayr's penalty lead, before, then in halftime, he scored and then converted it into a solo attempt to make Ayr 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who replaced Baggot, reduced the freedom by five points.
There was then a serious injury waiting room for Ruarid Knott, which was removed, and at first, Ayr brought the head back together further until Stafford McDowall's attempt, replaced by Climo.
Captain Ayr's rep, Blair Macpherson, was later given a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the payment of an extra man including the unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvine, ending with a report of bad pressure.
Returning to the home side, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow reinforcement to Climo without the ball, starting with the outfield penalty, MacPherson touched down from the back and Ayr's injury progressed further.
Climo changed, as he did in the reboot, after Kyle Rowe's box debris brought to him by David Armstrong was sent to Gregor Henry's valuation outside the fifth attempt on the house.
Still Game is like a new job in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran was looking for a move into the hospitality industry when it was discovered that he had been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which is written and co-written by longtime entertainment enthusiast Greg Hemphill.
The series has been announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show's run, and Kiernan appears to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the hearing records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The agent declined to comment on the story, with a source in the Scottish Sun stating that Kiernan was looking for you to participate in Glasgow's "growing restaurant business".
'The sea is our union': Bolivia's landlocked land is hoping the court will re-open the Pacific route
Sailors Roundabout at the rigging-clad naval base in La Paz.
The flag of the seabed is flown in the social buildings.
The Marine Corps base at Lake Titicaca in the Amazon wrote in one of their counterparts: "The sea is our sea in law.
Knowing is mandatory".
During the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the 19th-century Chilean coastal conflict remains as strong as the memory of the Pacific Ocean once again.
These expectations are probably their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has a synergy, a spirit of unity and solidarity, and of course a positive outcome vision", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the ICJ ruling on the big screens across the country, as hopefully the Hague court will see as a response to Bolivia's claim that - after decades of debate - Chile was forced to negotiate an independent withdrawal from the sea.
Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia's attractive people - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - also has a large rise to power on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court unfortunately cannot decide whether to ban Bolivia - and that it would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN has no authority to provide any support on Chilean territory, and said it did not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
That the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final argument was heard, which called the case "not solid", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And far from being the cause of Bolivia, they can put the last four years behind them.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian authorities", Zárate said.
Morales's hostile remarks diminished the desire of the Chilean remnant, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile continue to talk about it, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to have a conversation after this.
The two countries have not exchanged representatives since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions would not be unusually expeditious.
Monday brings Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to open a new era of Chilean relations" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of conflicts of mutual interest", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still the only Latin American president known - had used the maritime issue as a political tool.
"Bolivia never denies its right to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past".
South Korea says it can't come up with a nuclear weapon until it trusts the United States.
South Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never put nuclear weapons first if they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow the pledges made during the Singapore summit between the competing leaders.
His comments came from the United States. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be worried about the resumption of nuclear-armed diplomacy more than three months after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's return to Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that the continued sanctions and US refusal to declare an end to the Korean War never brought the North to its knees.
Washington is concerned about the approval of the declaration without Pyongyang first making major arms-deployment moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is real about the issue of tolerance that the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows have produced the latest line of big hats on the High Street near you.
If you want to increase the combination of your hats or to completely cover them with a decorative finish, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled the look of their large-scale entertainment caps in the SS19 walkway, which has surpassed the model set for Paris Fashion Week.
Real high-end hats were streamed on Instagram and these designers sent their amazing foundations under the stage.
Valentino's amazing girlfriend was the top hat that showed the way the big-boxed ball filled the heads of advertisers.
Other large-size items included a hood, magic hats and even candy - but they weren't designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also mentioned the amazing choice of masks - and its timing during the holiday season.
Many colorful masks had a very hairy forehead that looked a lot like Hannibal Lecter's replacement for the designer sacks.
One foundation is like a swimming pool with a plastic respirator and glasses, and the other is like a melted ice cone.
And if you keep saying the big bang, you're lucky.
The supervisors assume that adult baby hats will lead their way through the highways near you.
The big size caps come with their long La Bomba shoes, the two-legged, wide-sided, strait-haired caps seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The religious symbols behind the real high-heeled hats that have been streamed on social media send another great platform - the beach hats are almost as big as the type of swimsuit she's wearing.
The burning orange palm tree tray, cut into a piece of palm tree with a white leather handle on top, is an unusual piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 Paris Fashion Week mix.
Famous model Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the arrival of more hats and beach bags on the long-distance hotspot - as the designer has made such an impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale products".
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global learning.
Scottish school independence has maintained a track record in higher education, and this was followed in 2018 by unusual test results, which only strengthen the individual and achieve a combined success in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
And with 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, representing the Scottish Schools Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the highest level of service to their students and siblings.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career and their position as international citizens.
As the education sector can design and complete the best school curriculum, we see modern languages emerging as popular and selected subjects in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak his particular language, go to his heart".
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on Britain alone when we want to build relationships and trust between people from other countries.
Starting with the test results today, we don't see these languages getting to the top of the league table and high pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached a high A-level.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved A-levels in Mandarin, with 72 percent learning German, 69 percent learning French and 63 percent learning Spanish also achieving A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Modern languages, such as the subject of education, are taught in the same way as STEM (science, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Labour and Skills Commission found the reasons why most people find it difficult to fill vacancies, with 17 percent reporting language skills being shortened.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future jobs.
And the future of jobs requires languages, and these skills are more important than in a globalized world.
Regardless of the job chosen, if they learn a second language, they will actually get the future benefits of having a long-term career like this.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically introduce you to a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language enough to have a conversation and 15 percent spoke French as the only language in two letters.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, has provided children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school has different languages.
A number of schools are focusing on highly advanced languages, while others are teaching languages that are considered very important to UK children when you look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For all your children's interests, there is always a choice of languages in primary schools and in the training of skilled workers.
Scottish Primary Schools have the ability to provide an educational environment that prepares children for and equipps them with the skills they need to succeed in everything that is ahead of them.
It is undeniable that in this time, in the global business environment, languages continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this has to be put into education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools continue to provide a high level of education, diversity and education for young people in Scotland.
It has to be well done.
John Edward is the Scottish Regional Director of Independent Schools.
LeBron to do the Lakers' Sunday show in San Diego.
The wait is closer than the support looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets of San Diego.
But just how many minutes he'll play is still being decided.
"It's more than one under 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
In the next training session earlier this week, James was asked about his Lakers' six-game schedule.
He said, "I don't need to play games before this stage of my career".
Trump's West Virginia Rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a campaign of interest in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's one of Trump's five planned rallies to begin next week, including a halt to friendly parties in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation of his suspension of the vote to fill the seat in the Supreme Court, Trump is planning to build a midterm election as Republicans face the risk of losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how is it watched online?
Trump Wheeling, a West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally online in West Virginia via a live YouTube video.
Trump may be speaking at this week's hearing in the Supreme Court of the defendant Brett Kavanaugh, which has made it harder to confirm the Senate's expected vote to be suspended for a week after the FBI investigations.
But the goal of the mass protests is to help the Republicans face the impact of the November elections and get a moving role.
And so, President Trump's campaign said, these five rallies next week mean "activating volunteers and supporters like Republicans to try to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The Central Government is very important to its agenda that the heads of state travel to as many provinces as possible and we are talking about a busy campaign season", said the campaign spokesman Trumo, who shortened his name to Reuters.
Planning for the Wesbanco Talks in Wheeling, the nightly rally brings fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Monday in a month that Trump jumped West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 points in a row in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Sen. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, who is holding back the vote.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to support the election", said Simon Header, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown courage to fight to keep up with the expectations of the participants by going to the Sunday solitude.
After the side-scrolling, on Saturday afternoons, the four people could be what they needed for the Ryder Cup.
The rotating counting clock is designed entirely for the game's vision but one thing that players really believe in, and nothing more than tournaments like this.
So where would they say the line is now?
"They had six points in the lead, and now it's a finger, and we're a little bit of a finger, I think", Jordan Spieth said as he was breathing his breath.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead of twelve more than the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their pockets and have a lot of inspiration, not least in the way Spieth and Justin Thomas played all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth was a danger from the green to the pioneering example.
This roaring shout of the swimming continued to grow as the round passed, hitting the key to taking the four-point shot when he and Thomas were two shots behind each other.
His victory in the 15th race was met with a scream, the kind that tells you he believes that North America is not missing this.
"You really have to dig down and worry about your competition", Spieth says.
All of these players are gone now.
18 holes to mark.
The average player with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
European equipment but only four of the four couples can make mistakes.
"Moliwood were the only club not to score a single goal on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the goals on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and late summer at nine in the morning on Friday.
That race, and the energy pattern that seems to be going to the races in the summer and coming from the noisy crowd, makes it hard for them to be athletes to win Sunday, and there won't be famous athletes to win future games and lose to Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
To ensure that the same type of clothing is preferred, stay in different hostels.
Talk about Europe's unripe success, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short stint as Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of their four balls, followed by Alex Noren.
The goal and the double dig simultaneously free the Spaniard and the Swede to the cave they never got close to climbing.
On Sunday, though, there was no one to help you out of the cave.
The four balls and the four players are very interesting to watch from close range because of the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the technique can change quickly.
Europe has played well as a team so far and has taken a significant lead on the last day with its 40-player lineup also showing that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
Europe took the lead 10-6 to Ryder Cup the next day.
Europe will take health benefits until the final day of Ryder Cup after the Saturday ballpark and the four players with a 10-6 lead ahead of the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo brought the trend to two more wins than Tiger Wood's effort to take their number to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, betting on the victory they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, captured the United States side with their four-hour morning heat and took the lead 3-1.
The United States offered resistance to four people, who won both races, but could not eat the death.
Im Furyk need eight points from Sunday 12 singles races to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first new European to score four consecutive points when he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after an exciting week, are the only pair to win four points since the start of four tournaments in Ryder Cup history.
By knocking Woods and Patric Reed out four balls, they then managed to beat Woods down and new American player Bryson Dechambeau with even a hard 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself into two races on Saturday, did not show a good showing at times but has now lost 19 of 29 races in four balls and four players and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was left with four balls in the morning, became Justin Rose's friend, the four players to 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks in the World Cup - reaching one or three.
Europe does not have their style, although it has a happy, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three key winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set the U.S. score for the points table on Saturday.
They found a bold 2&1 by defeating Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter with four balls and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 with four balls.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come from the four-point margin to the solitary although as holders of the Fury side they had to fight to win.
After being the second best of the best for a couple of days, however, the Sunday attack looks like it will avoid them.
North Korea has said that China should not take up arms alone without confidence.
The North Korean interior minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would further remove its insecurity within the United States and that there was no way the country would leave its nuclear weapons to him under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Commission at the Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken "important" positive steps last year, such as stopping its nuclear testing, dismantling its nuclear testing site, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any consistent response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in national security and under these circumstances there is no way to put our own weapons first.
When Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "Nuclear Process" that would reward North Korea for taking decisive action, his key report was that we should not deny the single-use nuclear weapons that have fallen out of the fingerprint as Pyongyang did in the past.
RI cited the joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on the first ever meeting between the US chief of staff and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to investigate the nuclear deployment of the Korean islands when Trump pledged security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea was seeking an official end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States said Pyongyang should lay down its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has rejected the call to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States is insisting on putting nuclear weapons first and increasing the pressure to achieve its goals in a forced manner, and even refusing to declare the end of the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can stop us from kneeling is a dream of people who are afraid of us.
But the problem is that you have to keep the arrest going.
Ri did not mention to the investigators of the second meeting between Kim and Trumo that the US leader had told the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister's replacement revealed three clashes between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past few months, adding: "If the group on the nuclear weapons issue were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear weapons on the Korean islands would not have come together".
Even so, the voice of RI's speech was interestingly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US with North Korean missiles was inevitable.
This year, the United Nations, which last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, credited Kim with taking the nuclear arms measure, but said work remains and the ban should be in place until North Korea has nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trumo said we don't have time for this, saying that if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The strengthening of sanctions on the Security Council continues vigorously and unsuccessfully until it fully recognizes, finally, the verified nuclear weapons deployment.
The Security Area has jointly supported the North Korean sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and plastic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang for the second time next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times earlier this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only within hours of North Korea being convicted of committing such gang-related acts.
North Korea has pledged to launch Moon this month to open a missile base and build a nuclear facility if the United States takes appropriate action.
Kim said the steps he was looking for were security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and he moved to normalize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvar take a course on rest
This year's new course at Harvard University aims to encourage graduate students to get more sleep to combat the growing adult culture of mid-term learning by suggesting nighttime sleep.
An academic found that students at leading universities around the world were lacking in monthly content on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was assigned to the development, which believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleeping pollutants on education.
And at the end of it, one girl came to me and said, "What am I being told about this, the year I was on top?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, he told Telgraph.
The course, which started earlier this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help to promote academic performance and well-being, while also promoting overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services, said the university decided to start a course after finding out that students had a significantly low sleeping rate during the week.
The one-hour course involves exchange activities.
In one section, the student will receive a picture of the bedroom, where they will click on cups of coffee, curtains, caps and books about the effects of coffee and lighting and how the sports show affects insomnia, and the importance of a regular sleeping pattern.
In another study, participants were told how long periods of sleep can increase the risk of heart disease, diarrhea, anxiety and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interconnecting features, then encourages the participants to reflect on their own unique lifestyle.
We know that we cannot change the culture of students at once.
We believe that lawyers have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke, Professor Czeisler added.
The tradition of night-time sleeping is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough, good quality sleep, becomes the key tool for the student to fight fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight loss, as sleep deprivation makes the masks hungry, constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physiotherapy, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, taking one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push the whole class.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students at the secondary university to complete the same study program before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised the student to consider installing an alarm when they are sleeping, especially when they are awake, in addition to the harmful effects of the blue light from the electrical screens, such as LED lights, which can throw off unbalanced biological clock strikes, causing trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal of Menga is to put Gerrard's men in the game.
The Rangers struggled with another tough task on the day of the blue absence as Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox side looked to record their first win on the road since February 4-1 victory over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side were hit by Gerrard's breaking second 18-game as manager to leave eight points to pave the way for Landbrokes to lead the Hearts League.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break and the Rangers came in in a short drive that never looked the same.
Rangers came in sixth, Livingstone came in third and only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And there was another problem for Rangers after the assistant to the head injury surgeon Calum Spence was clearly thrown out at the end.
Gerrard made eight substitutions to the side that went from Ayr to the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, had the same Livi 11 brand that took the Hearts dot last week and would have been pleased with the well-dressed style he wore to his opponents every time.
The Rangers took the field, but Livingston did a lot with the ball they had.
They had to score two minutes in the first period, but in the middle of the game he took his big chance on a large scale.
The long free-kick was then found by Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Ala Lithgow only hit him in the back of the head.
The Rangers took over the bench but there was a lot of hope and I'm convinced about their third game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he was taking a quarter-hour penalty when he hit Steven Lawless but gave Steven Thomson his brother the hand and loosened the petitions from the Colombians.
The Rangers were able to throw both first half goals but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kell had little trouble hitting Lassana Coulibaly with his hammer on Ovie Ejaria's head.
When Livi was in the 34th minute, it was against the rules, and no one could deny that they deserved their passion alone.
For the second time, the Rangers failed in the most difficult part of Jacobs' career.
Scott Arfield responded when Declan Gallagher threw the ball into the hole to Scott Robinson, who sat down to produce the small Menga completion.
Gerrard cut as a break when he switched to Coulibaly and then to Ryan Kent and the switch gave him the most immediate impact when the shooter hit the inside of Moreles but the amazing Kelly ran his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to impress the game's visitors with the kind of game they were interested in, with Lithgow and Halkett washing the ball after a long ball.
Holt's side had broken their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lthgow headed wide into the corner.
The Rangers replaced Glenn Middleton with another punitive claim when he hit Jacobs but Thomson turned around a second time.
Almanac: The Geiger Count
And now from the page of our Sunday Morning Almanac. September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THIS is the day... the future of the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed the radiation detection and measurement model, eventually leading to the Geiger Counter.
And with the scientific reliance on it, Geiger Counter has become a very reliable object, even in 1950's film "Bells of Coronado", which was represented by the seemingly impossible camping scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Why are we surprised by this?
Rogers: It's the Geiger counter, used for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these devices, you can actually hear the radiation released by the atoms in the ore.
Evans: Tell me, make sure she jumps right now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
Both inventions have their names.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the body's immune system to detect malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see the deadly cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing the patient's immune cells and replacing them in the laboratory.
And then they can see the general cancer protein and then they can go back to the way it was.
A test vaccine showing the results of patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, was diagnosed with cervical cancer that had been hidden for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing the patient's immune cells, replacing them with a laboratory that can then detect a common cancer protein called HER2 and then transfer it back to the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Marland, said: "The results suggest we have a very effective vaccine".
HER2 "carries out the pathogenesis of several types of cancer, including breast, uterine, lung and kidney cancer", Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of this type of blood cancer.
He started with a supporting speech for Trumo, wearing his MAGA caps, then SNL's Muqaal.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West gathered in the studio during Saturday Night Live after the shocking performance that was praised by US President Doland Trump who said he was running for office in 2020.
After recording his last song of the night, Ghost Town, which he wore the US cap Make It Big, he continued to attack the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often talk to white people who say, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if we were concerned about the hateful race, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with the star of Hollywood actor Matt Damon, who defended Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not a broadcast, the image of West's anger was posted by the social media outlet of the Rock Club.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to change West's post.
Also, West has been praised by the audience for spending a lot of time in the late summer on stage talking about what he's wearing.
They called me stronger in the last stage.
And they said, 'Do not send him out with a hat on.'
They threatened me.
And then they said a hole, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see where the house is?" and says, "Can she put on her hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments attracted at least two shouts from the audience and the SNL cast members appeared to be the ones who were shouting, "Differences were reported", even though only one person there told the press.
West was later brought in by his replacement, Ariana Grande, who died a few days ago along with her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller.
West surprised many with the performance of I Love It, as well as wearing clothes like Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the media group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most courageous souls: YOU ARE OUR FIRST FOR THE BOOK".
But the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "realizing who he is and that's absolutely amazing".
But I chose NOT to reward someone (either by buying their music or clothes or supporting their fan base) who I think takes and spills the principle; it's bad for society.
It's free.
We too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name and was now officially known as Kanye West.
She is not the first artist to change her name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy, and Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion from the music of his famous song Prince, changed his name to Prince as a brand and later the former artist became known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast's restaurant valley
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed inside a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The accident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to be brought before the Belfast court on Monday.
The offence will be reviewed by the Adult Litigation Service.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington has been hit with toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his recurring role as Jon Snow in HBO's thriller series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor struck out with the look of a macho hero, who, like screen actors, means something that little boys often like to be tough to consider.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed they were wrong and asked if she could address the problem of toxic psychology within the modern world.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he feels strongly about the subject.
I felt personally, so strongly, in the moment -- where did we go wrong with the personality?"
What did we teach men when they grew up, in the crisis situations we see now?
Kit believes television is partly responsible for the emergence of psychic poisoning thanks to her psychic actresses.
She continued. What is born and what is taught?
What's going on in the streets, and on the streets, that makes little boys feel this special aspect of being men?
I think one of the biggest questions of our time is -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something is wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will make a prequel to Game of Thrones or a pre-recording when the series ends next summer, saying he's done with the battles and the horses.
From November, he will reprise Sam Shepard's True West, the story of the filmmaker and brother, who is a Buddhist.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that dating his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife at the show, and then she kind of gave me my family's future, my life from there, he said.
Rose is portrayed by Ygritte, the love interest of actor Kit Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning animated series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% of new cases
China has now announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health officials said.
Up to 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, indicating a change in the past.
Traditionally, the rapid spread of HIV in parts of China has been caused by blood transfusions of diseases such as HIV.
The number of people infected with HIV in this form has dropped to zero, Chinese health officials said at the Yunnan Provincial Conference.
A year later, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose to 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious issue within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the alleged discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's racial values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have had sex with other men eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease is due to sexual abstinence, which is not appropriate for this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to have an HIV vaccine available globally as part of efforts to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that her employees have disclosed the data of the GOP senator, and she's blowing up dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
Democratic candidate Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned the allegations that a member of her staff had shared private information with three U.S. Senators in the House of Representatives on the Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles County Department of Justice confirmed that the allegations further offended far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and lies are bad", Waters said in a Twitter report.
The information reportedly released included the address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was released online on Thursday by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during the annual hearing of allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The news came three days later when three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Media sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of the message was contacted by the Waters office and shared information with a Waters staff member, Hill said.
This is a baseless and unfounded accusation that is completely false, Waters continued.
The staff member - whose identity, privacy and security have been agreed upon as a result of these false and false accusations - is not responsible for disclosing the information in any way.
This is a baseless accusation, and it's completely false and full of lies.
Waters' report quickly attracted online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is anger", Fleischer wrote.
The recommendation does not have the character of becoming a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They must not refuse.
They should ask the person's feelings.
They must be resident.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's response to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for the seat in Waters in the midterm elections, also took up the idea on Twitter.
"It's great if you believe", he tweeted.
In her report, Waters said her office had warned relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of false claims.
"We will ensure that the finalists will be revealed, " he continued, "and will be legally responsible for all their destructive actions and risks to our employees.
Johnny English is down again Review - the powerless Rowan Atkinson spy scam
It is now a tradition to look for the importance of Brexit in any new film with a British-style that does not seem to be fit to revive Johnny English's pride in anti-fraud action - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is a debate about how we are garbage becoming a new export opportunity for the nation?
At every level, the blunt, unskilled plastic face of Johnny English has been licensed and renewed for a second season - a title that more than anything else indicates it's a broad-based medium for non-English speaking audiences in the movie industry.
Dabcn is a stupid spy who, with his amazing claim to his charming charm, got a little bit of Clouseau, running Mr. Bean and the man who participated in the solo writing of the London 2012 opening ceremony of the Chariots of Fire series.
It's also basically based on the traveler and international atkinson secret once represented in the forgotten barclayscard tv commercials, his retirement from college.
There are one or two good minutes for this latest exit from JE.
I love Johnny English who's going to the helicopter when he's wearing his midnight suit of armor and a rotating hood that's going to be a short one on his hat.
Atkinson's obvious gifts of material are presented, but material feels powerless and hardly needed, especially as the film's "real" labels like 007 and Operation Unlikely Hun now reliably provide the material as it is.
The mother feels like she's connected to the children, and the adults change, and I'm Johnny English's addict to not being as doable and stressed as Atkinson's funny, sexual Bean characters.
The commonly held annual opinion is that England is in a dangerous situation.
The hacker has infiltrated the British intelligence network, showing all British intelligence at work, to be terrified of the intelligence person at work - a role that could be played by Kevin Eldon.
It's the latest effort by the prime minister who is a self-righteous and troubled individual who has suffered from a reputation for being completely over-the-top: Emma Thompson makes her personal effort to look at Teresa-May but there's not much in the script that works.
Her intelligence advisers informed her that after any espionage operation was completed, she should fire someone from the job.
And that's similar to the kind of undercover model Johnny English himself has, now working as a detective director in a good way, but giving record lessons on how to be a secret spy: good laugh while English gives the Rock School the kind of spy academy.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency interview and reunited with his longtime former assistant Bough, who was second-in-command to Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, who has moved to the position of CEO, a role that Vicki Pepperdine has lost a little bit.
Batman and Robin finding things to go wrong with the Queen's Intelligence Service returned for a second time, meeting Olga Kurylenko, the authoritative and romantic wife of Ophelia Bulletova.
Then the prime minister fails under the tech billionaire who claims to solve English computer problems, the hacker Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their long journey of comedy with a lot of action: by pretending to be protestors, setting fire to French restaurants; they created trouble by luring themselves on the pleasure boat Volta; and the Englishman stirred up a clean riot when he tried to use computer-generated imagery to identify himself outside Volta's home.
All stops were removed at the last minute, but as friendly and tough as it is, there was a little bit of a baby tip about the whole thing.
Something very mediocre.
And like other Johnny English films, it doesn't matter to me to think: didn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that's really fair to his talent?
Labour has refused to plan a plan for the British to work four days a week but pay five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is thinking of a hard plan that would see Britain working a few days a week -- but with a salary of five.
The party will reportedly submit to the company's managers the inventory created in the context of the labor revolution by giving additional capital leave.
She sees the workers interested in three days a week - but still spend the same salary at home.
The sources said the idea would fit the corporate economic agenda and plans to orient the country more towards workers.
I support the shift to four days a week by the Chamber of Commerce as a way for entrepreneurs to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "The review of the law is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
The overnight shift does not happen but four days a week work is a sign that the party's approach to rebalancing the economy is appropriate for the benefit of the general industrial workers of the party.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party will commit to four days of work per week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The incentive does not support the Labour Party at all, however.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "Four days a week is not the party's rule and the party does not think about it".
Secret Service Secretary John McDonnell used the last Labor Conference to take his view from the economic equity market.
Mr. McDonnel said he has decided to take advantage of the power of faceless managers and the "facial recognition" of service companies.
The secret cancellation of the plan also means that current shareholders in water companies will not have to re-invest as the Labour Government would have done in the "closing" of the accounts for the reasons considered to be wrong.
He also confirmed that the company's board of directors had created the Additional Ownership Fund to give 10 percent of the company's value to the employees' own business units who stand to pocket the profit raised up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tell us 60 minutes if the research at Kavanaugh's FBU can change their mood.
An FBI investigation into the allegations of Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least one week, raising the question of whether his office could dissuade any Republican senators from supporting him.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minutes ago, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI would reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his friends from South Carolina.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said, "I went to the hearing", and I said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh".
And after this had happened, I called him, and when the charge was brought against him, he said, What hast thou done?
He makes tough, tough decisions, unquestioning decisions.
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be on the rocks.
"It was in my mind that about Brett Kavanaugh, she would take an active blame", he said.
"Warning. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it so strongly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And anyone named by her could not confirm.
She is 36 years old.
I don't see anything small changing.
What is the solution to the world's citizenship and what does Satan do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York is hosting the World Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event that brings together a great lineup of performers and, at the same time, a great campaign, ending poverty.
Now this week, the World Citizens' Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn not only to these acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which in 2012 declared itself an extension of the World Citizens' Initiative, a group of international lawyers hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (if you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), people who attend a music festival must complete a series of activities, or steps such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how did a winner of the World Citizenship become a 12-year-old man who had to achieve his goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with free music festivals in a real way to convince people to call for action, or in some other case what's called "helping with a political issue online" - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizens has said it has registered more than 19 million steps from its fans, moving towards pushing for hosting for various goals.
She said these actions helped to encourage world leaders to announce policies that would cost more than $37 billion and affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from actions, at least $10 billion that had previously been paid or raised.
The team estimates that the fund has had a direct impact on 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important pledges include: UK-based charity, Charity Power, investors and implementers pledged to help children grow to their full potential and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help local malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizen World.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social inequality in nutrition the lowest in history.
The group also said that after 5,000 actions were taken to call on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Nutrition Power, which will reach 5 million women and children in the creative process.
And it's the answer to the frequently asked questions on her website that ask, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The world citizen replied: It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we fail and fail.
And then, like civil rights and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers in the middle of this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can steal my military's assets and stop exporting tanks to Russia.
Washington could, if necessary, deploy its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Syria's participation - especially, where it is being conducted at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a justification for exploring new energy markets.
"We believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to kill energy like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hemisphere of Europe", he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of doing things.
"The United States has the ability, like our Navy, to ensure that seabirds are open, and, if necessary, closed, to ensure that energy does not enter the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking with attendees at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that, in its own words, speaks to consumers of energy in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, saying they are similar.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to replace or replace fuel, he said, referring to Russia as a "one-horse scam" because the economy depends on the extraction of fossil fuels.
The report came as Trumo administration was working to support the export of its sensitive gas to Europe and to replace it with Russia, the cheapest option for European customers.
In the meantime, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable 2-pipe Nord Stream project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin something Moscow has.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is purely a financial project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons, such as unfair competition.
We believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for choosing companies, Turkish Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading trade union, the German Industrial Association (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"We had a big problem when a third government intervened in our energy reserves", Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI), said after the meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Vladimir Purin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "hard look" into the 2020 presidential race, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will conduct a tough presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a term on the Holyoke, Massachusetts city council, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, including women in leadership", she said, according to Hill.
After November 6, he will take a rigorous examination for the mayoral race.
Warren weighed in on Mayor Donald Trumo during his time in the city hall, saying he was taking the municipality in the wrong direction.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
The news was honest about her criticism of Trumo and the Supreme Court's narrator Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote".
The poll released Thursday, however, showed most of Warren's constituencies that she did not think she would run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "postal voters" in Massachusetts said the senator was not in the race, according to the University of Suffolk's Center for Policy Research/Voting at the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the race.
The poll showed further support for the race of former President Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential race and 48 percent opposing it.
Other top Democratic names have spoken about the 2020 race to include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD as the result of Doland Trumo.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What's wrong with my son, what's wrong with coming back, I can't connect with other families who feel the approval of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are coming back from", she told a crowd of Doland Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called for the closure of the pink in the room and said her son and the other fighters, they would come back as little different, they would come back defeated, they would come back wondering if there was any consideration of what their other soldiers and pilots and other members of the military have given to the country.
She was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, interfering with reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., supported the new asylum-seeking initiative.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal fight against the new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and municipalities enlisted a court-appointed partner in Washington on Friday to support the law-abiding asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The full name of the lawsuit is Grace v. The lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed Augusto against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner and the sons of gang members had violated the terms of the U.S. authorities' refusal to grant her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are issuing large numbers of asylum seekers from the United States, as a nation facing the need for problems from criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Act became effective in 2014 with the Immigration Appeals Board's decision to allow illegal immigrants who fled domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a report Friday that the new law has been undergoing decades of state, federal, and international law review.
Federal law requires that the defendant's claims be protected by the facts and circumstances of the claim, and that this restriction violates the principle. The court's confidential partner said.
The lawyer argued that the data from the interview suggested that the law that denies immigrants entry would damage the U.S. economy, suggesting that they could become entrepreneurs and provide essential employment.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration officials not to provide additional asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
No asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of pressure or fear related to race, religion, nationality, or membership of a social group or political opinion, Sessions said in his June 11 proclamation of the law.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the dangerous problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Survival centres in Palu after the death toll doubled in the search for rescuers
With the rescue workers, the situation was getting worse.
It feels hard, says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is staying with her upset child in a displaced persons centre in the depressed city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings a dead person.
Clean water is low.
The locals were seen returning to the ruins, taking clothes filled with water, trying to find what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, which was greatly strengthened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated abroad as a result of the subsequent tremors.
His eyes were filled with tears when he spoke about the feeling of the massive earthquake that hit the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to be sick, no time to save ourselves.
I've narrowed down the walls, I think, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.
The US ambassador has accused China of propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-week daily domestic ad in the United States selling side-by-side profits from China-US trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Doland Trumo last Wednesday cited a supplement issued by China Daily Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denied.
Trump's accusation of interfering with the US election by Beijing has pointed to what US officials told Reuters as a new face to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue ads to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in a growing trade war that has seen the levels of education cycles for each product they export.
China's earlier revenge tactics in the trade war were aimed at exporters in the United States such as Iowa who supported the Turmo Republican Party, experts from China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime state senator for Iowa, the state with the largest agricultural output to China, said that biking has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
The Chinese, Branstad wrote in an editorial in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "are doubling down on these threats by making a disparaging ad in our free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's sympathetic culture of free speech and free speech by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
Conversely, in the newspaper marketplace in Beijing, you will find different voices that will not see the truth of the different ideas that the Chinese people have in China's economic slump, and it seems that the press is under the thumb of China Asset Seizure, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most popular newspapers has refrained from publishing its articles, although it did not mention the magazine.
Republicans Isolating Women Voters Before the Midterm Election Failure of Kavanaugh, Voters Warned
As senior Republicans who are defending Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court on several counts of sexual assault prepare, the commentators warned they would see a failure, especially by women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The scope of this has been extremely high, and most Republicans are in the register now showing that they have voted first.
This is not surprising, as Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) pressing the last minute of the FBU investigation will be enough to ease voters' anger.
"Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or no November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the development group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters announced that November is coming when they protested on the Senate floor when the Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination ahead of the testimony of Secretary Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats is off the agenda, Stu Rothenberg, a non-white activist, told the website.
People who have been up before, that's true.
But it will outnumber, especially among the alternate voters in the city and among young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, when they don't like the mayor, often vote.
Even before Ford's general statement of her allegations of sexual assault against a person who testified in the Supreme Court, the apologists suggested a negative reaction that could come if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has become a bad thing for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the board or her final vote or whether Kavanaughla took the seat, it's also about the way the Republicans have treated her since then", Guy Cecelin, the director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be a little bit divided on who to trust at the beginning of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, and a little bit more later.
A new poll from YouGove found that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, whether for sure or not, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavanuagh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied to them in a nutshell or in a safe manner during his testimony, while about 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating charges against Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, Gaurdian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanugh, fearing he would attack her at the age of 17, had sworn.
Ramirez accused the high court of showing her support when they attended a time-honoured ceremony while studying at Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web Project Leader to launch a new Internet to take Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a small startup that is looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology behind the project of the ultimate superstar, Inrupt, is the firm that built the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who is authorized to access the information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intern behind Inruo is the global adaptation.
"We have to do it now", he said at the beginning.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online database: POD.
It includes contact lists, to-do lists, timetables, music libraries and other specialist materials.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, and it's available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about a private online data store is that it is fully accessible to the user.
The company called for the power of data sharing.
The idea of Inruot, according to its CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the resources, systems and skills needed to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform acquired by IBM, some of the developer staff who contract to work with the project, and the community of branded volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world would be creating a web-based application using the available resources of the Irupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not talked to Facebook and Google about whether or not to start a total transformation when all of our businesses are completely transformed overnight.
We do not ask their permission.
In a statement to the Center on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Inrupt Initiative must provide economic and environmental energy to help preserve the integrity and quality of the newly built grid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee developed the internat when he created the World Wide Web Unit at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been the influential voice of the media debate network.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and CEO of the United Nations' Global Broadcasting Corporation, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I have incredible hope for the net", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross emergency holiday carrier
The only British church to have won the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior fought against his home for 100 years.
The High Shield Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a Shiite who never knew he was going to win the honour of the highest rank of the British army.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandparents on a visit to Rushden, Northamptoneshie, on Saturday.
One of his great-grandparents, Michael Vann, said that the white stone will be displayed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's successful graduation.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 the High Sheriff Vann led his party through the Canal de Saint-Quentin, in the middle of a massive trench and under heavy bullets from the trenches and the projectile system.
He then ran into the line of battle and with the greatest of aggression led the line to the side before he ordered a gun to fight without this man and hit three of the operational forces.
The high shield Vann was killed by a German shipyard on 4 October 1918, a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of my uncle were -- something I knew I never lived through but something that was toxic.
He and his brother, Detective James Vann, also took part in the aftermath of the Garda, which was led by the Brentwood Youth Group of the Kingdom.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the guards" and added "The true heroism that was shown in the support that would be given to many".
MMA fans have been suggesting Bellator 206 all night, and they've found Peppa Pig's alternative.
So, suppose you've gone through the whole process of watching Belator 206 only to be denied the most important event.
The San Jose Bill consisted of 13 flights with six key cards and was sent live overnight to Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, British viewers were stunned by the broadcast that was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not affected after they had suggested until the early hours, especially during the fighting.
One fan tweeted that the change to children's cardboard was a kind of joke.
It is government law that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable and they must switch to the children's program, says Fave Schartz-Bellator, a marketing and communications officer when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their plans to add British audiences in the future.
I think when I think about moving back, I think it's going to be better in some ways", Coker said.
But six o'clock in the morning on the Sunday, and we shall not be able to make amends until the day of our release, the day of our appointment.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there are many old and old posts that aren't all my friends.
We were trying to do it, and we thought it was a technical flaw.
But I didn't keep it a government issue.
I promise you next time that it won't happen.
We're going to keep the fight to change six - as we usually do - and we've tried to send it to the fans and we've got it over.
It's a sad situation".
The Sahara Islands: Tom Daley felt very sexually weak.
The late Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the courage to become a success.
The 24-year-old didn't realize until he entered high school that nobody was like me.
Speaking about the first tracks on 4 Desert Island Discs proposed by Lauren Laverine, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also becomes the parent who makes him less interested in the success of the Olympics.
The long-time host of the show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as the ocean-flooded Laverne in his first show, Daley said he felt "a little less: anyone else growing up because it's socially unacceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "Until today, these feelings of less sense, and different sense, were the real things, and they were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was gay, he said, and then he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally learned about sex.
The Olympic gold medalist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to argue for more countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke about it because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion actress said she fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - which surprised me.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years younger, last year, last year, but he said age gaps never become a problem.
When you're so much with you at a very young age -- he left his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he says he struggled to find someone who was old and had trouble and goodness.
They became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his perspective had changed.
If you asked me last year, all I needed was to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there's something bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son has the same name from his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father would not accept his death and one of the last things he asked was if they still had their tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I can't tell anyone you're not going to be in the front row, Dad".
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and he didn't until he stopped breathing and he died when I finally accepted that he was an unharmed person", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the gold medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to give up in front of a crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
She also supported the selection of her first song - Proud by Heather Small - which needed a voice to build an Olympic that still made its mark.

Mickelson, who was not playing well, was suspended from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he hits his 47th race, Rydre Cuo, but he will change the format to keep him from entering a hapless place.
Mickelson, who is playing the record-breaking annual doubles event for the 12th time, was eliminated from the game by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday with four balls and four players.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he often was in the United States, the five-time winner divided his day into being a fan and working on the game at the level of hoping to solve his problems.
And never the most straightforward drivers, even the top of the profession, 48-year-olds are well suited to Le Golf National, where the usual toughness is punished by a painful throw.
And if her path wasn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth race on Sunday, met the right-hander for the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood's newest signing to win four of their races this week.
If the United States, four points below the start of the singles competition 12, gets off to a warm start, Mickelsn's race would prove crucial to its completion.
Fury has shown the confidence of his husband, and we can't say much.
"Finally he realized the role he's played today, touching my back and holding my hand and saying, 'I'll be ready tomorrow,'" Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's the first game of the season and he's contributed a lot to this team in the past season, and this week,
I didn't even photograph him playing in a couple of tournaments.
I've been drawing and thinking a lot, but that's how it worked and that's how we thought we'd go.
He left the place, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It marks the end of a career that never suited his personal record.
Mickelson has won 18, lost 20 and drawn seven half-points, although Furyk said his presence has led to an untouchable part of the team.
He's a very aggressive, he's a very aggressive person, he likes to talk people into it, and he's a great guy to be in the room with.
I think young athletes should have been looking for him this week, which was a must see.
It gives more than just to play.
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leader can hide quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a moderate lead can lead to a promotion only in the final days of the Ryder Cup and become simply an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in 1997 in the Valderrama competition, where the captain of the Seve Ballesteros side took a five-point lead over the United States but the club crossed the finish line in the first half of the tightest limit, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we didn't have a great lead at Valderrama; we led too much at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama; where we won, but", Bjorn said, pictured, after watching the 2018 Winning Series 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
And then history will show me and everyone in that group that this is not over.
You're going at a good speed.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This may not end until you have taken the score.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the cup, and that is the key to constant focus.
I said to all of you, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we know very well what stands between us on the other side - the best players in the world.
Pleased with how his players presented the game of hard golf, Bjorn added: "I never went ahead of myself.
Berries are a different thing.
Beri is a special exhibition coming to the side, and that's the different thing to do.
It's great to be there with a partner when a few things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're fully tested for your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message that you need to be a player, to find what's best for you tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner somewhere else and he has to go and get better, after all.
Unlike Bjorn, the number-one opponent Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better personally than his predecessors, with the exception of Jordan Speoth and Justin Thomas, who chose the points out of four.
Fury himself was on the sidelines of the big turning point the next day, as part of the Brooklyn team's victory before finally losing to Europe's "Museum of Medina".
I remember every bad word he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, called his players on the final day.
We have 12 big races coming up, but you'd like to get off to a fast start, like you did in Brooklyn, like you did in Medina.
When this movement is in the way, it puts a lot of pressure on these middleweight competitions.
We've organized our gathering accordingly and we've produced men in a way that we feel good about, you know, we're trying to make something amazing tomorrow.
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to bring a counterattack against Rory McIlroy at the top of the competition, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter among the other Europeans at the top of the list.
"I followed this group of guys because I think it covers the whole road", Bjorn said of his only options.
So the new war in Germany is still being postponed a second time.
The newest German naval vessels will have to be authorized in 2014 to replace the warships in the Cold War zone, but they will not be there until at least next year due to the flawed systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The approval of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the subsequent dispatch problems with the distress caused the amount of the project to be undermined.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class submarines ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be used as a replacement for the Bremen-class anti-ship.
It is understood that they will have a very powerful anti-aircraft linear and anti-aircraft missile capability with a variety of hidden technologies, such as radar, metallic wave signatures and a thickening.
Other important features include long-term maintenance - it may be possible to operate the newest warships up to two years away from the country's ports.
However, the continuous delay means that cutting the bow of the warship - which is said to allow Germany to demonstrate the country's superiority in any way - will now be out of date.
The F125 cruiser became a major news item last year when the German Navy officially refused to deploy the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a shipbuilder after it was sent.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of dangerous software and hardware vulnerabilities that rendered the ship useless for combat operations.
The software side was particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class submarines would operate with a crew of 120 sailors - half the capacity of the former Bremen-class submarines.
It also turned out that the ship was surprisingly heavy in weight, which reduced the performance and limits of the Navy's capabilities to add to future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be as small as the similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the wrong idea, the value of the entire project - including the training of staff - will also be a problem.
It is reported to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the previous €2.2 billion.
The problems of capturing the latest warships have become the most urgent warning of the German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy is actually running out of ships capable of operating.
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because the aging ships have been removed from military service but no replacement ships have been paid.
He was convinced that the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of the videographer
A new study by the Scottish Highlands Survey aims to show how the filmmakers use landscaped landscapes to hunt for food.
The expected results will clarify the culture of isolated flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust in Scofland will follow the common and the evening species (soprano pipistrelles) as well as the long-winged ears and the Daubenton vulture at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Private records will be kept in the main areas around the building to keep track of evening activities throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers will also carry out the collection of mobile data using handheld screening tools.
The sound examiners of all recorded material will ensure that all evening and evening calls are sound.
They will produce a map of their habitat and report to provide a detailed survey of their culture.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for NTS's conservation, hopes the results will show the areas where they live are most important for the evening and how they use all types of wildlife.
This information will help to achieve the benefits of managing the workplace as a green space and how best to protect the forested areas of the forest and other related areas.
But the debate in Scotland and throughout England has been largely rejected in the last century.
It is a risk to the construction and development work affecting the areas of the migration and the loss of habitat.
Light-emitting metals are also at risk, such as tin foil and chemotherapy components in building materials, as well as attacks by parasites.
The cameras are actually blind.
However, due to the nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more useful to their eyes when it comes to catching what they're hunting.
They use experienced on-site voice retrieval techniques to identify difficulties or obstacles during their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 of the farmers and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, took the video camera seriously.
They trained ten experts, who regularly carry out data collection, field research.
The organisation even built its first scottish video storage camp and dedicated video storage camp at threave land in dumfries and galloway, which is home to eight of the ten scottish video storage species.
The manager of that land division, David Thompson, says the agency has the best land for them.
"We have a big place for video cameras here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, many old buildings, and all the good places you have visited.
There's a lot of unknowns about the video camera in Laine, and then the work we do here and in other buildings will help us understand more about what they need to survive.
He stressed the importance of watching video before a census is carried out inside the building as it is possible that the unintended destruction of the birthplace alone could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly destroying the local mosque.
The child is protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, torture or destroy in the place of birth.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Food and Agriculture Fund, encouraged people to help.
She said, "We're still learning a lot about video cameras and a lot of our species don't know how their music works".
Rolando has denied the allegations of rape when lawyers began prosecuting German media.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been targeted with anti-rape allegations as a false accusation, saying that people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers filed a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have allegedly raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
After he paid $375,000 to silence the accident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram and talking to 142 million people connected an hour after the allegation was reported, Rolando, 33, rushed the report as a "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
They said today, the fake news, the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or was on camera.
They want to exalt themselves by using the name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I was a happy man and all good, the player added, whitening his teeth.
Rolando's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations they call "unacceptable and questionable privacy disclosures", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz and the players are seeking compensation for damages in proportion to the extent of the violation, which is legally one of the most dangerous violations of privacy rights in recent years.
The alleged accident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a hard-fought bar-busting, Rolando and Mayor reportedly returned to the player room, where he allegedly raped her late in the summer, according to the papers filled out at Clack County Court in Nevada.
The mayor said Rolando had stopped kneeling after the suspicious accident and told her that he was 99% good man down 1%:
The documents said Rolando confirmed that she had had sex through the vagina, but it was consensual.
The mayor also said she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but accepted a contract outside the court because she felt "scared of revenge" and worried about "not being publicly shot".
My 34-year-old wife says she is now looking to withdraw from the contract and the accident has become more and more comforting.
Rolando was on the verge of joining Real Madrid and leaving Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian defender Juve for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Will Britain ever be worse off than the automotive industry?
Britain will still be worse off if it questions its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it would be worrying that British Toyota told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal". Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese driver said the effect of delaying the border event without a deal would result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of Europe.
"My vision is that Britain will leave the EU at the end of March and we will see production cease in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have raised fears about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border businesses will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close a small factory in Oxford until the month before Brexit.
The biggest concern about what carmakers are saying is where the cars are distributing goods in the event of no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line is in a self-cleaning process, which delivers metal parts every 37 minutes to both UK and EU manufacturers for automotive order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there will be a border disruption which could lead to delays and delays in the production of automotive parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than a k on the price list one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and then production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's checks on her plans for future EU relations will be "more realistically assessed to protect her checks across the border".
We need to reach a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us, as I said, not a win at this exciting time but for me it's about us seizing this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 on Today.
The proof came not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers that we needed to be able to continue this was a very successful segment of the product distribution segment.
Toyota had no control over how much production it had stopped, but in the long run, it warned that the added cost would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and ultimately the labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for Burnaston for 24 years and is the organiser of Unite for Industry, said the members are increasingly frustrated.
The government spokesperson said: We have presented a realistic and realistic plan for our future relations with the European Union.
Trump's second meeting with Rosenstein will be delayed, the White House said.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with next Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is pushed back to another seven as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanuaggh continues, with White House ruling Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of private consultant Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, the relationship between Trumo's supporters and Russia and possible obstructions of justice by the prime minister.
If Trump is going to fire the attorney general's office, and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, it has sparked much rumour for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wireless access to record Trumo's conversation and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday morning, he left the White House, and there was news that he was going to retire.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced to take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to take Rosenstein off the job but the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing by the Supreme Court's Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the charges against Kavanaugh, which will delay the full vote in the Upper House.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I see that it will happen again in another week as there are all the other things going on in the Supreme Court.
But I'll see and I always like to share something new with the press".
Some journalists object to the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of media coverage did not call the TV reporters' motivation "self-saving", although she said: "I do not deny the fact that they are doing so".
And then she suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press would increase.
"The mayor attends the S&A meetings more than any president before him", he said, without further evidence.
The reports will continue, Sanders said, "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is definitely better to talk to me.
We're trying to do this a lot, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and that takes the place of the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly listens to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with guest guests.
Press conferences with a person are rare.
In New York City this week, the mayor of course showed why, making himself uninteresting and sometimes surprising in front of the press.
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU staff at NHS Scotland fearing Britain's decision to break away from the EU.
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to the EU staff at the NHS in Scotland expressing his gratitude to the country and wishing they would remain after the break.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter to her as she died less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to pay the costs of applications for legal residence for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continue, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its readiness for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to repeat it again now, as I evaluate the performance of each member of the staff, regardless of their birth.
Workers from the EU and abroad bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and advance the work of healthcare, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to be here".
Christion Abercrombie is in emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the stadium outside and crashed there", Reed said.
Trainees and healthcare staff gave Abercrombie oxygen while he was in the outdoor stadium before the container was removed and taken back for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no further information on the type/size of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who was a student who missed his training two seasons ago, was in his first season in the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five runs in the Saturday before leaving the game, ending his season with 18 runs.
Foreign buyers will be subject to additional documentation tax when they purchase a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged additional tax on documents when they buy a home in the UK, with the extra cash being used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans.
This move will ruin the success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters.
Increases in taxation of documents are levied on non-taxable persons in the UK
The estate manager expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of document tax when they buy a home in the UK - with the extra cash used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Corbyn's movement in attracting voters of lower age by promising to offer affordable housing to those who receive more money.
The increase in tax on documents will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money being increased by the government's action to eliminate the wall.
The additional costs - in addition to the current document tax, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for secondary housing and rental properties - can be up to three percent.
The funder expects the move to generate up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, who raise prices and make it harder for first-time buyers to access the floor of the house.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially the capital - have become "moved-to-towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in document tax to help many young people get their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of raising house prices by smashing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to exceed the limits set for low-cost housing to address the "housing dispute" in Britain".
Mr Corbyn has announced radical reforms to the proposed housing reforms, including the housing control and the cessation of "unemployment" evictions.
He also wants to give the committees greater power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my leadership to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our cheap housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be easy for individuals living in the UK, as well as for foreign companies, to buy homes like the more environmentally friendly people in England.
Many people dream of having a home that is far away, and the shame of a wall is still real".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "ultimate goal" is to become Scotland's coach once again.
The 42-year-old Scot is delighted to be reviving the competition with the North-East club, who are currently in 3rd place in League One, with three points earned for first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership title last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I found a B-cap and it looks like that", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father Hampden many times as a child, and it's always something I miss.
That opportunity will only come, but if I succeed in the management of the club".
Sunderland's former coaches before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to model those valuable names for the big club, having previously refused to leave Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My successes at this point will be decided by 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the construction and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly worthy of the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I can only see myself having achieved success here if I bring the team back there".
Ross has been in his leadership career for only three years, after serving as an assistant professor at Dumbarton and for 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He later helped Alloa recover from the relegation to third place, and replaced St Mirren with a relegation attempt and led them to the championship in the second tier the following season.
Ross said he felt more stable than ever as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It may have been a real change", he repeated, as Alloa's guardian.
"I really believed that management was more suitable for me than playing.
It sounds amazing, because I've been good at it, I've made a meaningful life out of it, and I've enjoyed it to a reasonable degree.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you need to go through every week.
I'm still going through that in terms of work stress and stress, but management is the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, and it feels like the most peaceful thing I've ever done in my entire life as long as I've been like this".

The best time to drink half a liter is at 5.30pm on Saturday, a study found.
The summer heat has raised revenues for Britain's failing wine restaurants but put a lot of pressure on the restaurant groups.
Wine shops and bars posted a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but the cost of restaurants fell 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, who collected the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup exceeded expectations, meaning that July followed a similar pattern in early June, when the wine cellars rose 2.8 percent, except for the fact that restaurants fell significantly below me.
The decline in the restaurant business of 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
Alcoholic drinks and bars have been the strongest when compared to the number of restaurants that have fallen.
The restaurant also suffered from the sun, although not as much as the restaurant business.
It seemed that people wanted to go out for a drink.
Overall sales of beverages in liquor restaurants and bars increased 6.6 percent that month, while food fell three percent".
Paul Newman, entertainment and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The climate and the impact of major social or sporting events are the main factors when it comes to out-of-market sales in the neighbourhood.
It seems unsurprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, despite a fall in sales of 4.8 percent a year in the next year, which will be particularly painful due to the increasing pressure on the constant purchase costs.
The long hot summer has not been a bad time for food business and the timing will tell us that the average temperature we experienced in August will provide more soul".
The total sales growth in all wine and restaurant establishments, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the marketing of new products.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales supervisor for the UK wine-restaurant, bar and restaurant sectors collects and analyzes performance data for 47 operating groups, which have a combined revenue of over $9 billion, and is the established comparison company.
One in five children has a secret social media address that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some from the age of 11 - has secret social media addresses that they hide from their parents and teachers, the data shows.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "fake" Instagram pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being uploaded.
Twenty percent of the students said they didn't have a "great" address to show their parents.
One in five children - some from the age of 11 - makes social media headlines and hides them from the stupid.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the increase in "fake" Instagram addresses - references to Instagram photo sharing sites.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being uploaded.
Twenty percent of students said they use "big" addresses to show them to parents, while they also have special ones.
One mother who went to the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter saw young people urging others to "suicide".
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two titles, with half of them admitting to having specific titles.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is unfortunate that many young people have dared to create websites that parents and teachers cannot access".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the players at the Scottish Light Games Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the current non-executive director of the Scottish Sports Board at the Annual General Meeting.
Doyle, Scotland's most awarded sports star, said the move was a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect from the people of Scotland, the UK and the world of sports and we are sure that the Scottish sports will take advantage of her to bring her to the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta as part of his four-time Olympic gold medal squad and is now a regular guest on BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a brief filter attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a dream.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I was recovering or the level.
It was a tiring job, but I fully recovered, and I learned to walk again, and today I do the techniques of movement!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breastfeeding campaign comparing mothers to cows has spread the word online.
A breast pump company has circulated the ideas on the Internet with an ad for mothers of breastfeeding cattle.
To mark the opening of what is said to be "the first silent, portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a premium video ad to showcase the freedom of the new breast pump it gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cattle barn full of grass to the point where they have stories like, "Yeah, I'm taking milk, but you don't see anything", and "If you don't know these are cattle's beard, it's my breasts".
The song continues: "Reproduce, export, I give to babies, export, export, I feed my daughters".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reviews from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "cracking" of the dairy industry.
""It's a very poor decision to restrict the use of cattle.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for their babies being stolen from them a few days after birth", one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is secretly similar to the breast pump in the nursing home (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It is understandable that it hurts both mother and child.
But why don't you use a breast pump to advertise to nursing mothers?"
Another added: "This is a science-free advertisement".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she got the song "happy".
"I think this is a dangerous idea.
I would have taken one if I was still breastfeeding.
So absorbing the pump made me feel exactly like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a dangerous product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is an interesting ad for dairy mothers who are lizzing (usually at their workplace or bathroom) and feel like "cowboys".
This is not a publicity that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
The end of the video shows the women's group dancing with secret bombs on their breasts.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely quiet, without wires or tubes and goes into the same way as the breastfeeding tube, giving women freedom to walk around, hold their babies, even go outside and suck them.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of the mother commented: "Elvie breastfeeding is a policy-making product that deserves a bold and passionate start.
By comparing female breast milk and cow milk we wanted to put the breast pump and the challenges in all the light, showing a fun and interactive way with the amazing sense of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's breast pump has appeared in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the walk of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have made their way through the tent camp at the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children detained has increased despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has not changed, in part due to the heated talk and the policy introduced by the Trump administration that has made it difficult to hand children over to sponsors.
Usually, the most sponsored people were illegal immigrants themselves, and they were afraid they would jeopardize their ability to stay if they went ahead and claimed to be a child.
The risk was compounded in June when the federal government announced that sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albane, a senior official in the Department of Taxation and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of people who had applied to sponsor a child with no one.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or family members of sponsors are here illegally, many of them foreign criminals.
So we're going to keep following those people", Albens said.
In an effort to expedite the children's release, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some to appear before the court within a month of the arrest, instead of 60 days later, which was the previous level, according to the housing workers.
Many will appear in the call, rather than come in person, to apply for legal residence status in their case to the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be immediately deported.
Children are often in prison, and they are likely to become anxious or frustrated, which can lead to violent noise or attempted escape, according to housing workers and reports from the system in recent months.
The protesters said that these concerns have been raised in a large facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are likely to be ignored, due to their size.
They added that sending children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could lead to a riot that many people already deal with.
Syria has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their "forces" from Syria immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is now in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in Syria, in line with the access to counter-terrorism, and will be "managed appropriately".
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw", he said of the meeting.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terror is coming to an end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than a million displaced.
He said Damascus will continue "with this blessed war until we remove all the territory of Syria" from both terrorist groups and any foreigners who are illegally present".
The United States has 2,000 Syrian troops, mostly trained and commanded by Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for their return, accusing "some Western countries" of "exasperating the unreasonable fear" that led the refugees to flee their country.
"We have called on the international community and charities to facilitate recycling", he said.
"They're politicizing what they want to be a completely human issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a peaceful zone at the latest opposition forces' sites in Idlib has created an opportunity to push for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement proposed a major attack by Russian-backed troops in Syria, where three million people live.
However, Moualem insisted that the agreement had "clear timing" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front-linked al-Qaeda group, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first official meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to establish a constitution for the reconciliation of Syria ahead of elections.
Moualem conditioned the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the current constitutional provisions", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second time
With that in mind, Mr Trump will be able to be re-elected in 2020 if, as the free-spirited spectators hope, impeachment and impeachment do not end his presidency.
There will be no doubt about it, "The most amazing presidential vice president ever!"
So far, there are no signs of community hope.
Since 2014, the estimate of the most viewed time has doubled to over 1.05 million CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow's Crime" topped the radio ratings with 3.5 million viewers at its peak night.
"This is a fire that attracts people because we don't understand", said Neal Baer, a broadcaster on ABC's "Dedicated Rescue", about a Council secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the US Presidential Building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comic book writer, and author of "Only the Amazing Parts: And the Power of Hard Facts About Stealthy Entering Hollywood Boys into a "Group", has a different view.
She remembers taking a taxi to her hometown of Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
This includes a list of entertainment activities.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
The ear canal is a convenience only the luckiest viewers can afford.
But it's even more of a citizen's knowledge when you're spending six hours watching a panel of experts arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's "deep root" and citing his book "How to", a $15,000-dollar goatskin jacket by Paul Manafort ("full of the same size", the Washington Post said) and the impact of Stormy Daniels' description of Mr. Trump's, um, structure.
I, for one, never watch Super Mario like I used to.
"Part of what he does that looks like a real scene is that he feeds them every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's show on the work cycle and the constant story change (taking a fight to the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He could not leave, as Brett Kavanaugh will meet with the Supreme Court's Judicial Committee in the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing shows one day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' " Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out to be a dish".

A silver rush is coming up in the toughest midterm election in the country.
It's no wonder that the 17th Pennsylvania state receives a flood of money, thanks to a congressional district merger that puts two current officials in a race for the same seat.
This recently brought back the Democratic Representative for the suburban Pittsburg district. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is opposed by the current incumbent Republican, Keith Rothfus, who now represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is now in the hands of the new 17th district.
The maps were updated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former counties were baseless and based on Republican will.
The new 17th District competition touched on a tough financial campaign between the economic branches of the major parties, the Democratic Committee of the Independent Councils (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning the highly-watched March Special in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by the Republic for nearly a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats the chance to win.
The United States is going to punish El Salvador for the tax it gave to China, but it's going to pay back.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with Washington pulling back.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Administration team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall US diplomatic operatives in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial aid and visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As domestic meetings were underway, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to oversee a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending any consideration of the sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration's preparation for the meeting, diplomats said.
Three US presidents have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new sentences of severe sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the arguments cited by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks on an unrecognized situation.
Their addresses were supported by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke about the unrecognized situation.
The date of the study
The next thing to be expected is the report of private counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible blockade of justice, who now has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly conducting an investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged undercover activities in Russia and the attacks he has launched on our elections.
If Congress hands over, Mr. Trump will see him face the group's account, as he prepares to return to the voters, and of course, finally to the conservative legislators.
That's a bit of a misnomer, and that doesn't mean I'm suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or one of its European equivalents.
There is a role that we all have to play on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight can last.

We failed, and we missed the opportunity to get away from the last year of genocide.
The course of history revolves around the intersection of the two, and the intersection of the unprotected democracies is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of the most dangerous areas.
What will I do if Mr. Trump is fired from the job of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a state of disarray since the newspaper reported, last year, that he had proposed secretly filing for the president and thought he was not good at his office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the headline of The Times was inaccurate.
"How will I respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is cleared to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and a false witness that can be satisfied?
So, when we leave, will we vote for the midterm elections in Congress and will we be held accountable to Mr. Trump?
If we fail these exams, democracy will go on for a long winter.
Rather, I believe that I will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had previously occupied my embassy.
She survived, and immigrated to the United States, 60 years later, and sent me the Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika sign on it.

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is hopeful ahead of Monday's Rapid Vienna game.
The Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their victory over the Austrian side, after a remarkable draw against Spain's Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to advance to Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing in his first game of the season since a 2-2 draw against Villarreal but he believes the Rangers could use the result to jump into the big walls.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing we could get something and we came back with one point.
We might have brought about the end, but in general, the comparison was a fair result.
They were better than us in the first half, and we came out in the second half, and we were better than them.
Going out on Thursday, another great night in Europe.
We hope to get three points, but that's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but our people are behind us, and I'm sure we can attack and get a good result.
Last year was tough, between everything that happened with my injury and the change in the club itself, but there's a good feeling in the position now.
The players are good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
As we hope, we can push ourselves now, forget about the previous season and win".
Women are worried about the fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family members.
About half of the people in this national survey said they discussed their spouse's costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children.
"People want to take care of a family member, but they don't take the steps they would have taken in the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
It's the beginning.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot arrange for family care if you do not express your expectations and identify them well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Admit a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance that is attached to the money to help you cover these expenses or insurance for your property - as long as you have the money.
Provide your legal documents: Know the legal battle is ending
Prepare a health care agent's permit to appoint a trusted person to supervise your health care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to contact them.
Also, consider the competence of your financial lawyer.
You can choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to afford them.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has an emergency medical condition and is in the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian capital of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with deaths expected to rise.
With the communication cut off, aid officials were unable to obtain information from Donggala Regency, a locality in northern Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In the capital Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated during the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the narrow coast of Sulawesi Island's west coast, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a limited municipality located over 300 km (180 miles) of Sulawesi's northwestern coast.
The municipality, an administrative unit under the state, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi, especially in Donggala coast.
Nickel ore is also important in the region, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Control Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is in the Cycle of Earthquakes and Volcanoes of the Pacific Ocean and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people living along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the Nias Islands, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres in height that killed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A nearby earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya administration in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people recalled the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused at this time, but more than 100 died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: The largest earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilya, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and obstructing police, according to a report Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a girl who knew about the incident tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone off.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Center and is being held for $500 in bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly" when questioned about his application, the network reported.
Palin faces three of the Class A misdemeanors, which means up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanors, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time a criminal case has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with reports of domestic violence, and possession of weapons while intoxicated, which were linked to the incident.
Her friend accused her of stabbing her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of military experts in 2016 for linking her son with violent PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia's tsunami earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have fallen as the death toll is expected to rise further in the coming days.
The earthquake struck outside the centre of Sulawesi, north of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Images circulate on social media showing the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beachfront in Palu after the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seeking a summary execution for suspected terrorists in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment not carried out in the federal criminal region since 1953.
Saipov, 30, deliberately used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road on the West Main Street in Lower Manhattan, massacring pedestrians and cyclists who walked along his road in October.
To prove the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both cases may result in a death sentence, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court judge charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of contributing to the premeditated murder, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized cases, and in cases of violence and car wrecks.
The attack required "effective planning and preparation", the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov acted as "critical, cruel and disorderly".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage, and damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the purpose announcement states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was ten years ago that the last time a New York city was charged with capital punishment.
The lawyer, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder against two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of raping Soviet Union spies during the Cold War two years ago.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has expressed no dismay over the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
The investigator told him that he was happy with what he had done, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching the video of Daesh footage on his phone, according to the allegations.
He also requested that the Daesh flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He argued that he was not guilty of 22 misdemeanors.
David Patton, one of the federal general defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the crime, which means a prison sentence that is unlikely to be released, will only increase the shocking problem of those involved in these incidents and everyone involved", Patton said.
The Saipov defense team has already asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be entrusted to Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to 'father the army' today during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians should feel the heat of rejection of the EU - with one of the MPs, Theresa May, proposing that she be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told Birmingham's rally that the UK would have "been off" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
The challenge of Mrs May's highly fragmented group to reach a compromise was revealed by the man who claimed that the UK was pushing EU Tories to join a protest against EU alcohol in the city.
The president is being asked to agree a plan by her investigators in the face of attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The alliance insisted that it was continuing its efforts to reach a deal in Brussels with open-mindedness in its country - forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its plan and its "compromise".
Mr Bone said the combination of the cocaine meant that the cocaine that Solihull prayed for was intended to raise funds for the investigators.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been in charge already".
The Wellingborough MP added: "I'm for Brexit but we have to get investigators involved".
He said, "We don't fight wars in the world to obey the people".
We want to make our own private laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want EU capitalism is completely false".
Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkyns was also on the platform, telling reporters: "I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers are being mocked by the public, the opposition doesn't want to vote, our party is mocked and our supporters are mocked by those who have been running the streets to elect us first.
Please call Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "The Commissioners will remain in office if they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said in a statement that politicians "will reduce the heat if they try to override the decision taken in the 2016 referendum".
"This is a matter of trust between us - the public - and our political class", he said.
They're trying to get out of Brexit and we're here today to tell them that you're not going to do that.
He sent a message to the happy public and added: "I want you to warm up the politicians, those who are about to make a decision about Brexit.
We're going to organize the public army of this country that has put a stop to the Brexit victory. We're going to rest until we have our independence, our independence, our happy United Kingdom.
At the same time, the EU's advisory team gathered in Birmingham before they went out for a two-hour drive to the city centre.
A conservative group raised a flag against the use of alcohol.
Labour peer Lord Adonis has criticised the Conservatives for the security concerns they raised with the party's app when it opened the conference.
"These people are the ones who live that the IT system and all the technology that Canada has been using has been eliminated, without borders, free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It is a manifest indecency.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to use it to elect a president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren to use her to become president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a Western Massachusetts City Hall meeting on Saturday.
Warren, a presidential candidate for Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November after GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There were unreported reports that Trump would be assassinated in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th municipal election using the hall format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was a time when women were coming to Washington to defeat our government, and that included a woman in a top position.
Someone was shot dead by Sims at LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a person in connection with the shooting death of a LSU basketball player in Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11 a.m. ET in a press release.
They wanted the footage of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man who had seen the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually shot", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
He asked me to defend his friend and I shot Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, holding a gun, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without charge and extradited to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
All his 6-foot-6 junior years growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts in the regular season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup after a team commanded by Sebastian Vettel
It's been clear since Valtteri Bottas replaced Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' orders are taking a big part in the race.
From pole, Bottas played well and almost hit Hamilton's backside, defending his position in the first two rounds and encouraging Vettel to attack his friend.
Vettel took the lead and moved Hamilton to the back of the grid, a decisive factor in the race.
Mercedes initially stood sideways after a coaching defeat by Vettel, but Hamilton was upset after a slippery-sided drive that caused Ferrari's liquid to wear a lazy interior and risk holding onto the third corner after two moves to defend.
Max Verstappen started the back row of the taxi and was in position for a week after the end of the first class on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race, driving the tires to speed up and take Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived on the scene on the 44th but did not increase his speed to eight ahead of Raikkonen on the fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a lot of work all week and he was a cheater who was told to quit.
The team did an extraordinary job of getting a pair of shoes", Hamilton said.
That was definitely a very obvious and horrible language.
President Donald Trump has criticized the senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting she did not override the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the former chief justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking on a social media platform in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the jury, instead saying that what was happening in the Senate was showing that people were "bad and lying".
"The only thing that's going on in the Senate these few days is when you see the run-off, when you see angry, mean people lying", he said.
And when you look at the release and the override, and then they say, "Oh, don't bother me.
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get it?
Remember her answer... did you just show the document?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't do it myself.
Well, just a minute.
Did they...no, they didn't", he added, "that's what the senator is saying.
Feinstein received a letter explaining Kavanaugh's allegations in a plea from Ford last July, and was warned early in September - but Feinstein denied that the police had come to her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't cover up her story, "Feinstein told the board, Hill reported.
She told me to keep it secret and keep it as she told me.
But the president, who spoke on the same night Saturday night, refused to say, "I'll tell you what, that's really obvious and terrible language.
I probably didn't, but that was obviously the worst language I've ever seen.
In addition to his defense of the man who served on the Supreme Court, who was accused of raping three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges against them.
They are determined to transfer power back in a way that is not just a matter of life and death.
Do you see their madness, their wickedness, their contempt for those they hurt, for those they struggle to gain power and power, Mediaite reportedly said to the president.
Elite Cup: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against the Giants and scored in Dundee.
Dundee Stars have been on the losing side in the elite cup against Belfast Giants on Saturday with a 5-3 win in Dundee.
The Giants scored two quick goals and beat Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made a guest team comparison before Dwyer scored their first goal.
Francois Bouchard made a comparison with Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed the win.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe in the Elite Cup, who beat Dundee Belfast 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season, with the Giants winning their first three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:55 with Kendall McFaull assisting, with David Rutherford setting another goal and putting Beauvillier in the lead four minutes later.
As a busy season opener, Sullivan led the team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt kicked the ball to Cownie's back at 15:16.
Dwyer confirmed that the Giants were still leading the rest of the season when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first season.
The host team was organized, and Bouchard scored a second goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the first game of the second season and confirmed his team's fifth win in the final game.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are hosting their next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
One air traffic controller died to verify that hundreds of planes were surviving the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been declared a hero after his death, confirming that hundreds of people were on board the plane and were able to fly safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
After the earthquake, the crowd is shaking and the city of Palu is falling apart.
But despite the blooms in his friends' lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has tried to fill his seat at the airport's rotating terminal in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He did not move his position to confirm that his Batik 6321 flight, which was flying at the time, was flying safely.
And then he took off his shoes when he saw the tree fall.
He died in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Ministry spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian media ABC reported.
We set up a connector from Balikpapan, in Kalimantan, to take her to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left us this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were devastated when we heard about this death", he continued.
At the same time, officials fear that the death toll could reach thousands as the National Disaster Department reports that access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong villages is limited.
The death toll is still believed to be on the rise as more people are still in the throes of the devastation while more are being evacuated, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters have flooded Palu, which has been holding the demand for a mass grave.
Military and commercial flights are bringing aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "In a minute, an ambulance is bringing a dead body.
Clean water is short.
Small markets are also being looted.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Red Cross Indonesia is trying to rescue the survivors but we don't care what they see there.
This is a disaster, but it should be.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "Finally, I ask you to work day and night to facilitate further evacuation work.
Are you ready? CNN telephoned.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini has just announced that one man is missing after a plane crash.
The plane in flight crashed into the Pacific Ocean in a lagoon in Micronesia, claiming one man was missing after he had previously said that 47 passengers and crew were safely disembarking from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday morning it could not report a passenger missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to conduct a personal search of the man.
The flight did not respond to requests for additional information about the passengers, such as their age or nationality.
The local boat helped save passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The plane said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in a lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overrun the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's very good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through deep water to exit the emergency aircraft gate.
He said that the people on board the plane were scared and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who were repairing a small boat nearby also contributed to the safety by using a washboat to get people to the beach before the moon sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the air safety team shows that 111 people have been killed in the crash of a plane flying to PNG airlines in the past two decades but none of them were Air Niugini.
An analyst has described a woman who was a body-trader and was burned alive.
The lawsuit was filed on Saturday after a man was arrested for arson in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert witness in the investigation analysis unit.
He has accused the court of using recorded phone records to bring together 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received a few phone calls indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which underlines her earlier claims, Clarion's ledger telephoned.
When the information revealed that his phone was ringing Chambers's when he told him he was with his friend Michael Sanford, Sanford was contacted by the police.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he thought he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was telling the truth because my car was in Nashville".
A spokeswoman said Tellis said he knew Chambers for two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis included Chambers's messages, calls and contact information in his phone.
He wiped his life out, Hale said.
The lawyers are expected to have their arguments closed on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to end on the same day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?
Three hip hop groups want to change the negative perception of songs by filling their music with meaningful messages.

Another black person?
A New York-based mother sued a couple for being fired after a "concursory" message.
A New York-based mother sued a man and his wife for inciting white supremacy after receiving a bad message from her mother, complaining that she was another black person.
The man and his wife denied they were racist and the lawsuit called for a forced extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, had turned black on her first day at work in 2016.
"Oh, another black person", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, the replacement she would send to her husband, was sent to Ms. Maurice, twice.
When she saw her mistake, the unresident Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her former nanny, a black American, had done a bad job and that she hoped Filipino would do it in return, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice has sued her husband and wife for compensation for their work, and she is demanding compensation of $350 a day for six months, a musical job she had previously wanted, even though she had no contract.
I want to show you, look, you don't have to do this, she told the press on Friday, adding, "I know it's discriminatory".
The husband and wife were accused of being racist, saying that authorizing Maurice to work was a reasonable step, fearing they would be trusted after making a mistake.
My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
It's not racism.
I'm a racist, and Joel Plasco's husband told the press.
But would your child shake hands with someone you've abused, even if you've done wrong?
your newborn baby?
It is.
To justify the lawsuit against the extortionist, Plasco said his wife had a child two years ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you look at someone like that?
That's not the right thing to do, investment bankers said.
While the legal issue was still ongoing, the public prosecutors quickly criticized social media, blaming their culture and their thinking.
Paddington publishers are afraid that readers will take up speaking engagements, she said in a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of a first-time reader before it's published.
It's amazing what we know now about the great victory of Paddington.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he started writing a children's book made of children's toys, would have been thrilled to have seen his work published, and she added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "One with Good Things" after his death last year.
Paddington's comments, which she praised as a key member of her family, added that her father was very pleased with his ultimate success.
"He was a mute man, and he wasn't Spanish", she said.
But that Paddington was real to him, it seemed so much like having a kid who had a win: you enjoy it so much even though you're not really what he did.
I think he's going to beat Paddington because he sees it that way.
Despite his own creativity and thought, he always praised Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After her daughter was taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors could not save her life.
"She came to me to tell me that the solution was bad, that she didn't want to be safe", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
And then I got Nad to tell me that she was dying in the next two minutes and that she was saying goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Rise, I love you so much, dear".
We'll meet again soon.
I'll meet you.
The medication prescribed by the doctors to activate the heart slowly leaves the body and empties.
She died a few days ago, and this is what she was wearing.
I had to retire and wait, knowing that this was going to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I was so excited to get married.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now paralyzed from the waist down by her daughter, took another passenger on the flight - proving her own tragedy.
"No one knows", she said.
I lowered my head, and my teeth were flowing.
It's hard to explain, but she was on a plane, and I was so shocked by Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved and loved her.
A woman who is crying has suicide prevention cards on the bridge.
Two women whose relatives died by suicide are working to prevent others from cutting themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on the Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers for people to help them.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from a mental disorder that killed him at the age of 18.
"I can't wait for my parents to realize what I'm dreaming of one day again", she said.
Ms Davis, 45, from Lydney, said her son was an emerging chef with a strong smile.
And he knew someone by his smile.
They always said that his lighting would light up a room.
However, he quit before his death, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, saw him commit suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm a blogger who believes there is a negative effect.
Ms Davis created the cards to let people know that there are people you can talk to about your problems, even if they have a boyfriend.
Don't be silent - you have to talk.
Ms Humphreys, who was friends with Ms Davies for years, married Mark, her 15-year-old lover, after the death of his mother.
She said, "We didn't say if they were wrong or if he was mentally disturbed or nothing".
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was so unorthodox on Christmas Day -- when the kids opened their presents, we didn't look at them or anything.
She said that his death caused her great anxiety, but they had to cope: "It was a family tragedy".
It's been a long time coming.
But we must all walk and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy with the FBI launching an investigation.
"I thought if we could really get something like what he was asking for -- a short, limited investigation -- we would probably bring something together", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was anxious to break up the inside in a situation that could not be changed.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters try to investigate the FBI?
Their warning is a thing of the past.
The midterm elections are five weeks away, November 6 -- as I'm sure, the Republicans are not winning, so they're desperate to get the man they're running for the Supreme Court nominated.
George W. Bush called the senators, convincing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
There's a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not clear yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the final vote and nominate him to the Supreme Court.
The population of North Korea declined during Kim's rule.
The number of North Korean expatriates and South Korean refugees has been declining since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byeong-seug, who reports to the South's union minister, said there were 1,127 cases last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tightened border controls between North Korea and China and the large amount of money being spent by the smugglers were the reasons.
Pyongyang has not released any reports.
Most of the people who leave North Korea eventually become citizens of South Korea.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 North Koreans had been illegally stranded at the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of China is fasting, with the longest border with North Korea and easy to cross by changing the military's heavily guarded base from the two Koreas.
China has legal recognition of newcomers as migrants and often makes them forced to change their status.
Relations between North and South - which are still at the end of their war - have been improving in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks on the stalled nuclear disarmament deal.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without our trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no way we can put an international model of weapons first", Ri said in his speech at the UN Security Council meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has been criticizing Brett Kavanaugh, saying she is not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Majority leader Nancy Pelosi has criticized Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh for saying he is emotionally unfit to lead the Supreme Court.
Pelosi reportedly interviewed on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
I just couldn't help but wonder if a woman would ever get a job like this, they would say, "This is the end", Pelosi said in her speech before Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations of raping Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was very humble, sometimes about to improve his grade and testify about his family and his high school years.
He strongly criticized the Democrats in the committee, accusing them of "deception and conspiracy to commit murder" by liberals who feared Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelisi said Kavanaugh's remarks before the committee made it clear that he did not retire from the High Court because it showed that he was watching the Democrats.
I think he was opposed to his speech and the way he was treated by Clinton and the Democrats, she said.
Pelosi looked down when asked if she would vote for Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
I'm saying this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then let him be a Supreme Court leader, even in his current court, she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about Kavanaugh's suspension of the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is seen as a conservative judge.
In the hearings, Kavanaugh has been pushing for the reversal of some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for this kind of critical, bold person to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's amazing,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to get through it in a good way.
It was a passionate conversation on a plate, months and years of crying out in anger, and she couldn't help but shine.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I think that's unusual, can you imagine?
And she went on to say, "You helped me a woman manager out there, who made me cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You probably think I'm frustrated because I'm crying".
I'm upset.
And then it went on.
I found that amazing.
Education is allowed to remove the fugitive in part because something bad was originally entrusted to him.
One of the things I remember most about my previous job, a men's office, and I cried so much that I couldn't win, was that I was hit in the throat by a woman older than me -- a hot manager who I always shook off -- and that dragged me to a wall of stairs.
"Never let them see you crying", she told me.
 doesn't know you're angry.
They're happy that you're disappointed and they're happy that they've won you over.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, was a classmate of Gary Hart during his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found to have had another wife on a boat called Monkey Business and was a competitor, Ms. Schroeder, very angry, pointed out that there was no reason to avoid seeking the idea that she should be the president herself.
It wasn't a thoughtful idea, she said with a laugh three years later.
We had seven candidates in the race, and the last thing we wanted was another Russian candidate.
Someone called it "White Snow and Seven Coons".
It was the last time she raised money, so she vowed not to participate until she raised $2 million.
It was a battle that was going to be a failure.
She found out that some of her fans, who gave the men $1,000, that she was only giving $250.
"Do they have to be that I can't get them?"
When she made the announcement in her speech that she would not be involved in a campaign, her enthusiasm grew stronger - the reward for her supporters, her anger at the system that made it difficult for her to get money and to starve voters with delegate replacements, and her fear of gender equality - to the point that she was speechless.
And you may think I'm a neurotic, but Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
I guess you could say that Kleenex was my financier.
I remember I was dressed up, and I said, "Why are they crying when I am collecting money?"
Did she cry?
How the US-China trade war could be better for Beijing
The trade war between the US and China has been a hearsay one, and with the war over, a more aggressive interventions could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning this year, imposing taxes on key Chinese imports including solar, iron and aluminum.
The situation has skyrocketed this week with new taxes affecting $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of goods, which completely eliminates half of US imports from China.
Beijing has reacted in a timely fashion, almost taxing five to 10 percent of US$60 billion in goods.
China has said that the US is taking a step back, and the world's second-largest economy does not appear to be recovering anytime soon.
For Washington to back off means demands are being met, but for it to openly accept the US demands is a shame for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Yet, experts say if Beijing avoids the tide, US trade pressure can effectively support China in the long run by reducing bilateral economic partnerships.
"The fact that quick political decisions in Washington or Beijing could create a country's economic recession is certainly a very disappointing one that those who look up already realize", says Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is preparing for refugee migration, said the foreign minister.
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees and is seeking humanitarian aid to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of conflict.
Addressing the meeting of the United Nations, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure which has led to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to search the sites destroyed by terrorism to restore stability.
All conditions are in place to prepare refugees to return to their country of refuge and to international measures that focus on their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said he was asking the Syrian authorities for help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that fund terrorism.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US is now the sixth time in a row to lose to a European team and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the victory when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points against the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who did not play well in the World Cup, threw his tea shod into the water at the par-3 16th hole, with his game being won by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer scored all his rounds, becoming one of only five players to ever go 5-0-0 until the start of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth has placed the 5&4 player in the lowest ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who is about to play his final tournament.
In the Ryder Cup, Spanish player Sergio Garcia became the top scorer in the European Cup with 25.5 points during his career.
I don't cry often, but today I was crying.
It was a year of uncertainty.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for reading us and trusting us.
We're so excited, so excited to have a cup.
It's a team thing, and I'm proud to have helped", Garcia said, looking forward to their success in Europe.
He's turning the torch on the guy with the same name, John Ram, who's on the ground at your Tiger Woods 2&1 golf course for the singles game on Sunday.
"The joy I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has won all four of his games for France and has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
And this is an amazing statistic that one of the best players ever has, winning 14 trophies with just Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team is out every weekend to play together except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf in the Cup.
US team captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing game with his team, "I'm so glad the boys, they fought.
And there was this one time we were in the European team.
We're in the middle of it.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a very valuable captain.
All 12 teams played well.
We're reorganizing ourselves, we're working with the PGA of America and we're running the Ryder Cup.
I love 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to pay for your hats.
We're very much in their hands.
