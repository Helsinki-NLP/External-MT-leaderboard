The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day visit to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third-largest economy.
Plans for closer nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defense cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after speeding on motorcycle
A motorcycle was seized after the driver was traveling at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bush to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic officers in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored stop signs and continued on Burgess Road before veering into the bush, where officers lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were later spotted near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police are charging a 20-year-old man with failing to obey a stop sign and reckless driving.
He is due to appear at the Karratha District Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was arraigned at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent".
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Highland, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set the date for the hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh for 17 November.
The European Union has a duty to ensure that the rights of workers are respected.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
"As unions die, so do middle-class jobs", said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
So I'm proud to join with civil rights icon John Lewis in introducing the Employee Empowerment Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options for discrimination on the grounds of union organisation as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The amendment of the national labour law law to provide a possibility for workers exposed to discrimination to organise trade union representation, to seek justice in a civil court - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time, as millions of Americans remember, when this country called democracy, free speech, freedom of the press, and the right to unionize in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions were playing a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unite and negotiate and act together are guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would have to organize and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or seek to diminish this right are null and void; measures designed to do so are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and to have that union participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with businesses and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal that the working people must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representative bodies - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and redeem the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the implementation of a Louisiana law that lawyers say would have likely led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and scheduled to take effect on September 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to purchase a patient's license from a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
The judge's decision, however, means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions while they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they seek to obtain these rights", wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to reach a more permanent decision on the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the ruling, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it gives doctors more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are getting away with a backstabbing law that wants to take away their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also applied to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the lawsuit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key sections of a Texas law that would have forced most of the remaining hospitals in the state to close were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocates of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that doctors' rights to access the hospital require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some have also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient referral rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would stop performing the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, representatives from the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their requests for patient referral rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment leads to higher rates of death from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video online to honor their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Smaller study: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the women's medical care for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, preexisting conditions, and social and economic status also affected her chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for older women and those whose cancer had already advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests that late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities", she said.
Despite improvements in telemedicine services to compensate for the distance, she suggested that a possible remedy would be to strengthen the service of in-flight doctors to allow specialists to treat women closer to where they live, as well as treatment programmes for people outside her region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study found poor long-term survival rates among women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographic status, and emphasized the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres lament falling homeownership numbers
The decline, along with a further decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could cause garden centres to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "garden core", according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that renters spend on average 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular practice of paving front yards for parking purposes and the declining size of gardens are other factors threatening the industry, which generates an estimated £5 billion in annual sales.
The Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a six-year period, is reported as having the lowest expenditure on garden products per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that rental homes or small gardens do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant at the RHS, said: "Container gardening, for example, is very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when they move".
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the 'golden age' of garden retail due to the increasing number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecasted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather following unfavourable weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters stormed the state-run PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers were able to push the protesters out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped broadcasting for about 40 minutes, but is now back on the air.
At the same time, around 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they clashed with security forces, armed with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The country's army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without violence".
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays a major role in Pakistan and has staged several coups.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the May parliamentary election last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to storm Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey summons US diplomat for spying report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most senior US diplomat to brief on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US Embassy businessman and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that the findings of former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's main intelligence service was also targeting Ankara caused a much more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: train drivers threaten to punish commuters
The nationwide strike of the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stoppage, which will take place from 6 to 9 p.m., will affect all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and suburban railway transport.
The main focus of the warning strike is the freight traffic.
The report was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The German locomotive manufacturers' union (GDL) district chairman Sven Schmitte said in Düsseldorf.
We're expecting significant losses.
There are no regional priorities.
The main focus of the strike was on freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, GDL did not say where it intended to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Mallorca prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested on suspicion of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was placed under investigation by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, following allegations of corruption against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city employees to the office of the public prosecutor for anti-corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said the authorities' nepotism was having a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival", one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of this.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a viral YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British tourist fellatioing 24 men during a drunken tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behavior of drunken holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious drunken pub tours.
The Playhouse Club where the felony incident took place was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour operator Carnage have to pay a joint fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions is affecting flights from Adelaide Airport
SPRING has brought a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
By 9 p.m. in the evening, another 5 mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6 mm had already fallen on Sunday night.
The latest rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a shower that began just before 8 p.m. and produced nearly 4 millimeters of rain in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week brought an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell back to a record high of just 15.8 degrees on Monday.
The inclement weather conditions have probably caused the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a gale - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts at this time reached about 30 miles per hour on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off and land again on a second approach and finally took off at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay subsequently led to the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is forecast to hit a high of 16 degrees on Tuesday with possible showers.
Matthies says it's time for big networking
With the rapidly advancing technology threatening to turn our comfortable homes into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies takes comfort in a familiar electronic accessory.
As I'm writing this, I look at the coil cable that connects the phone to the phone, and I think, "Wow, how retro is that?"
But there's a reason for that: If it weren't for the cable, all the headphones would be flying around the house in a matter of seconds, and that would be even more retro.
The same applies to the electronic (electronic?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electronic scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if you have a tube TV in your living room today, you are simply saying that you are against it.
Why these considerations?
Because the IFA's urging on the radio tower this week again reminds us of our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman who once had a blind grasp of washing machines and CD players does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are being spread out before him with the incredibly vain expertise of "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies", the press office promises.
Yeah, are you okay?
What are you gonna talk to people who seem to be willing to spread that kind of quark?
In fact, for the last 20 years or so, we've been talking about connecting our homes.
So the yogurt can reorder itself, so the fire alarm on vacation in the Maldives can tell us that there's a fire in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get the air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream is sure to come true soon: We pick up our watch, say "Suck!" loudly, and the vacuum cleaner starts working at home.
I'm not sure.
It all comes down to nothing less than a revolution: "The lines between white and brown are blurring", a business expert says, you can connect the washing machine to a headset, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data goggles tell you how long the pizza will be in the oven, but that's no use because we're stuck.
We also know from everyday experience that when a pneumatic device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the coil cable on the phone will survive the next radio show.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters as rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and anticipation to communities in southern Israel that have been scarred by rocket fire, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the arrival of the students.
"We are a little scared, but excited", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many of the children in our neighborhood are in dire need of a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"Those were difficult times, and we never left the house", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or fled their homes to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that has been hit hard by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security".
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demands for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel demands that Hamas be disarmed and that the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting be handed over.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
The war has killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of the dead are fighters, but has not provided concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar rounds at Israeli cities during the fighting, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and some 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children of the world and Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After the election in Saxony: CDU deputy Strobl questions the NPD's ban procedure
In view of the NPD's vote losses in Saxony, CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl has spoken out in favour of ending the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
- Berlin - According to the CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should end.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time", Strobl, who is also CDU state leader in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and one that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD narrowly missed the five-percent threshold in Sunday's vote.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection service had informants in the NPD leadership at the time.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new proposal in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neulanderplatz, refugees are now being housed in tents.
The central reception centre for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Home Office has three Red Cross tents set up next door.
The district politicians were informed just a short time before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further fuel citizens' reservations and prevent district politicians from contributing constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees", says Britta Herrmann, Green group leader in the Harburg district assembly.
Your party demands that the district administration Harburg provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
The three tents can accommodate 96 refugees.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first ward are the influx of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the usual three months.
House prices have seen their strongest winter spike in seven years, a widely watched index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday's RP data.
This increase brings the overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's research director, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne were driving a two-tiered market.
Figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they rose 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average by five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless said that with the start of spring, there would be an increase in properties for sale over the next few months, which would put the market "on a real test".
"Given the continuing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the continuing low interest rate environment, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months", he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of the CEO Peer Medau and attests to this, "posing like a commander".
This is not the style of the university, the statement said.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the university's intentions in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong", says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not 'pre-determinations or even decisions', but 'preferences'.
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle, which was necessary for access, was also less dramatic than the medals feared.
A nine-meter wide street was and is not a question.
It is 5.50 metres wide, which is one metre wider than before", explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will in future only be used by university students is not accepted by Pötzl.
Parking is not done at all because, like other public parking spaces, it can now be done intelligently.
Thinking of the locals
The kindergarten Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and whose front door would lead to the parking deck, is to be "not affected", according to the university president.
He points out that "this is not just about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the nearby Realschule.
So it is much more than the particular interests of the Medau gentlemen", says Pötzl.
Whether the parents' advice of the nursery, that the extension of the road would "lose one of the few natural spots of Coburg", is justified, "the reader can decide for himself".
In early October, Pötzl will inform the city councils about the construction development of the university until 2020 together with the State Building Office Bamberg "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery last week about the plans of the college.
Accordingly, the access to the new parking deck should not be via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but via Medau-Berg.
This would require the narrow road to be extended to two lanes of about one kilometer.
According to the calculations of the Medusa, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would increase tenfold.
We are talking about about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city has so far refused to comment on the project.
Glandorf retires from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from Bundesliga side SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems as the main reason for his decision.
I didn't make the decision lightly, it took me months to make.
It's time for me to listen to my body's signals and end my career in the national team", the 2007 World Champion posted on his Facebook page.
He retired with a total of 167 caps and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the giant shooting guard for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on a hunting trip for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
The Icelander, who will announce his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they will inspire my longtime teammates and my successors.
But I want to be available for my club in good health for the next few years, which will require longer recovery periods, which the current double-load does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear the end of his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later caused severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two more procedures followed.
Then Glandorf filed a lawsuit against the team doctor, and the dispute ended in a settlement.
Twelve years of pro football and 11 years of national team career, no body goes unnoticed.
I have some health construction sites I can't ignore anymore.
After three intermittent operations on my foot in 2012 for infection, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
"I've been able to control my mind, but I can't fool my body", Glandorf told Handball Time magazine in an interview earlier this year.
He would only be ready for a comeback in the most immediate emergency.
"When all else fails, I am always ready to talk", the father of two told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble about my health.
After my career, I'd like to be able to walk at least fairly straight.
In addition to winning the 2007 World Cup and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrank by 0.2% in spring
The crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
The strong start to the year results in a GDP increase of 0.8% overall for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which on Sunday for the first time passed through the Burgmannstadt.
The town of Horstmar was invaded by Dutch "fietzers" on Sunday.
The largest cycling federation in the Netherlands, the NTFU, organised the so-called Münsterland Mooiste.
It is the largest cycle tour in the whole of Münsterland, the cyclist's paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants registered with Jos ter Huerne to thank him for organising this tour of the Münsterland.
This tour was advertised in various magazines and offered to interested persons.
We're from Der Helder and we drove all night to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland in this way", the cyclists were delighted about the route through the counties of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering at the shooting club, Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace march" through the city over the Wall, where the launch took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz over Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On 95 kilometres of track at an altitude of 1,175 metres, 120 kilometres at an altitude of 1,475 metres and 145 kilometres at an altitude of 1,775 metres, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organiser, Jos ter Huerne, and the mayor's representative, Heinz Lölfing, expressed their great pleasure at the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a great experience for everyone involved.
The organisation went smoothly and there were no negative incidents", Heinz Lölfing concludes.
Unfortunately, the number of participants was not as high as the organiser had hoped, probably due to the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend", the cyclists promised but nevertheless to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
The unforgivingly honest memoirs of Konstantin Wecker
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, put on paper in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought for thought, the Munich native, born June 1, 1947, wrote his memoirs, each chapter beginning with a suitable song text.
And he's ruthlessly honest, from masturbation in high school to shoplifting and drug use, he doesn't ignore human weakness.
He also wanted to show how he himself had learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow man.
He also explores abstract, but even more important, concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom of in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
He also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political involvement - and how not only music shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison time.
The latter also introduced the living man Konstantin Wecker to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting all that is unnecessary".
But among all the high-spirited views are brief anecdotes about the earth: about fights in a place frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride where he aimed a tree head-on.
He's also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father, and inspired by the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He's been in "a lot" of therapy since his mother died, and Henry's been reflective about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
- Get out of here!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were grown when I was a child, would take him to the pub and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had a conversation like that with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than in his father's day, he did gain a glimpse of what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep, stygic labyrinths with flashes of flame and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie in the tub and then you could hear him slowly singing because he could wash the foundry off.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to put food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Yet, as a child, Henry grew up without his parents' love.
My father never hugged me, never said "I love you".
It wasn't until my mother was in a bad way toward the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
I'm with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He's still friends with French, who he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I got very, very overweight and started showing symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this whole fitness thing and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's exhausting, you know?
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he's been absorbed in the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started when he was only 16 years old, working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage impersonating people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for quite a long time".
He was a professional.
I had to grow up not only in the public eye, but from 1975 to 1985 I had to learn how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a TV star, and that was really hard.
Lenny in 1975 with New Faces
Since his manager owned the rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable with that.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-old award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known for his role as chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought to himself, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just passing the time or stepping on the spot a little bit".
This was followed by a documentary series for Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned anything about him in school and I thought he was mostly middle-class, white in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they said, "You should try it.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few of the words in your mouth, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost like someone had finally put my head right.
"That's the thing, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he was in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed".
There was a technical glitch and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, 'You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God".
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You're in a play, so stay in your role".
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lyrics for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
And that was also well received, so it's like a big sign from the gods saying to me, "This is your destiny".
He says this, of course, in a THUNNING voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is punctuated by humorous outbursts while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I think that kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
If you keep looking for it, you'll end up with a wall.
I do live shows at the Apollo sometimes when I feel like it, but overall, I don't get as much as I used to.
I ask him if he's ever gonna do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director helping shape the beginning, middle and end of a journey -- I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think I did.
I like being an actor.
It's fun. I'm going to go.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I like stories.
People like stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party Ansar Allah said.
The access to the Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, the Houthis threatened to escalate the conflict further if their demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps along the main roads to Sanaa.
The country is in constant bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun biometrically registering all government employees to remove "ghost employees" from government payrolls.
Employees who fail to register within the next two weeks will not be paid, a government statement said.
The government estimates that thousands of people will still be paid after they leave the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month in payments to "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the civil service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure their data is recorded through biometric records, a government statement said.
All who failed to do so without a credible excuse were removed from the payroll, the notice continued.
"This will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the civil service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and also by adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'ghost employees'", said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are suing the Düsseldorf District Court for €19.4 million in civil damages against Achenbach and two of his companies in bankruptcy proceedings.
A court spokeswoman announced Monday.
The complaint alleges that Achenbach cheated when buying works of art and vintage cars and charged Berthold Albrecht higher prices than he actually paid.
This also increased the agreed commission.
Achenbach bought 121 million euros worth of valuables for Albrecht.
Children Need Roots and Wings
He was a school administrator for 44 years, 23 of them as principal.
Manfred Richter knows many famous Petershausers and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always driven by his desire to see the human in the student.
The Snow Head is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau, North Bohemia, now Trutnov.
At the age of 14, after four years of high school, he became interested in teaching.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight wagon.
So it washed Richter into the Upper Frankish village of Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Six times a week, Manfred Richter had to walk six miles (10 km) to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, walk two miles (3 km) across the city to school, and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg, Germany, with up to 15 other students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he passed the first state examination and in 1954 after three years as a teacher, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a teacher's position available for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year, these were consolidated in Petershausen in the present town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
To avoid being relegated to a smaller school, Georg Sigl, then the principal, moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to move into the present building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of then-Mayor Ludwig Götz, who built an additional workspace and basements at the expansion in 1997 at the expense of the municipality, although this was not eligible under the school building guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly", remembered Judger gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government official who had answered a school board lecture on law and justice: "Love must never be forgotten".
"There are two things you have to give your children: roots and wings", says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "That doesn't always work". Whether he meant only his students or his own six children, it's not entirely clear.
In any case, sometimes what Judge did was unconventional.
If students fought, he did not give them either a work-related sentence or a suspended sentence.
At the expense of the community, Judger had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents fight each other, even if there was a violets.
For the benefit of the school, as rector, Richter maintained a good relationship with then-mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This led the non-partisan judge to run for the municipal council in 1996 after his retirement, at least as the last on the CSU list.
But Richter was shortlisted for sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop at the spa in Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists stop in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten on their tour, that is not in itself something special.
On Friday, however, the number of participants alone made an impression: the 700 participants in the hr4 cycle tour, including the accompanying tross, enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
The theme of the event was "Riding and celebrating on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig".
On Friday, the cyclists took the first stage, which stretched 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by the mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel on his bicycle, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen family business, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 slices of apple, sweet potato, strudel and cheese cakes that made the skilled cyclists' mouths sweet.
"Only country women can bake cakes like this", praised a participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments were available at the drinks stand of the Geiss-Nidda gymnastics club.
The "Bravo Duo" entertained the audience with familiar melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A man also received a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he reattached bicycle chains that had already fallen off today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the well in front of the drinking pool and used the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Even promotion manager Tobias Hagen, who had been a tour guide since the first HR4 bike tour in 2004, could only snort briefly, as he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squad of the Hessian police using three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook posts and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region", he said, "but there are also cyclists from Giessen or Fulda, Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many towns in Westphalia.
The number of participants varies somewhat according to the accommodation capacity available.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II, in group accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short rest.
But in the evening, the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had been given a beautiful festive setting and of course delicacies such as flame cakes with well-chilled feather whites had been prepared.
The meeting was attended by the Mayor of the city, Susanne Schaab, the GTS Managing Director, Markus Hoßfeld, and the MSC President, Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his capacity as a member of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringen Executive Board.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many activities in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then cleared the dance floor.
The opportunity to move around in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests there were increasingly mixed up citizens who were as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
The second day's program included the Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb stations - including a concert with the Trenkwalders.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radeln, the athletes arrived in Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy against the government"
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "plotting against the government", local media reports.
The police authorities did not immediately comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly forming an organized criminal organization and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then prime minister) described her actions as part of activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Gülen against him and other individuals in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine are returning to school
Schools in almost all parts of Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Yatsenjuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their later life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She's coming in with a proud streak of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own experience on the front lines.
She began her career at Bain and Co., a global management consulting firm, before moving on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was the chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, and resigned when the top job at Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Her compensation was reportedly almost £1 million.
Their political standing is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business expertise at Whitehall: she became a Cabinet adviser.
Your husband is a former Tory councillor.
As far back as May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand at the heart of public life as a huge and complex entity, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: internally, to the first guard of one's own management hierarchy at the BBC, but also externally, as a voice of public concern and unease when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly which requires a complete and comprehensive reform.
But what newly elected president would risk running for office, taking everything he can get, tearing apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while potentially losing his own job in the process?
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, there are many more who are interested in seeing the BBC downsized - power, money and status taken over.
As competition closes in and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC presents particular risks.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into what is certainly the world's largest media company.
The BBC has a good story: they say it reaches 96 percent of all households, and each one costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems the BBC is back up the popularity scale: 53 percent support it now, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's viewing and usage habits have changed: I now get news headlines on my phone and watch missed shows later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found one.
Perry from Texas says the derogatory tweet was unauthorized
A tweet from the official account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic district attorney who is the focus of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another from Perry's user account, which denied the previous one.
A tweet was just sent from my account that I didn't authorize.
"I don't approve of the tweet and deleted it", the message said.
Perry's staff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets were coming from Perry's official user account, it was unclear who was actually running the feed.
The earlier tweet drew a negative image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a funding request from her office when she refused to resign, which led to an indictment of Perry - who may be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with three times the legal alcohol level ... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry if he leaks it".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office wasn't in charge of the grand jury investigation into Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution a political ploy.
His top-notch legal team petitioned the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charges, arguing that the law that is being used against the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigates state corruption cases in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto led to a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential bid, Perry responded to speculation that he would quit by tweeting a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market back to "normal"
One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had "returned" to normal.
Houses in the capital were in high demand and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set mortgage limits in June due to widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013", adding that this provides a "stable trading environment".
The London real estate market was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
According to the Census Bureau, prices in the city area have soared 18.5 percent in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales combined.
Average sales prices for Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "village tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending regulations, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in mortgage approvals in July, also indicating that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for London's 2015 house price rise down to 3 percent, based on already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, as the amount due on forward sales is over £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations has remained stable and, as a result, forward sales have also remained stable".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40 per cent to £280 million, and turnover increased by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's revenue for the current year was expected to match current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit is £450 million.
Berkeley shares were trading at £23.96 in London this afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performing at the 85th Academy Awards.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.
A representative of the "Tribute to Panem" star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were authentic and sued the hacker for "blatant violation of privacy".
Authorities have been notified and will pursue anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a vulnerability in Apple's iCloud online storage system.The alleged "master list" of hacked victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not clear how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World", also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you looking at photos my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home - I hope you are so happy with yourselves", Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickelodeon series iCarly and Victorious denied that the photos were actually pictures of her, tweeting, "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, folks.
Let's just get this over with.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They dissolved, as you might best describe, they dissolved slowly like a box left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, tiring, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratch.
It was spiny, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this pricklyness was a newly begun affair that had been more promising than ever in relieving the lonely boredom of his life and perhaps even bringing him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a beating heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Beetles was her aunt and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradisiacal valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, the baths were still full of spiders, snails had left their tracks on all the windows and thought they owned it all, and the garden was covered with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house in a fairy tale, both threatening and alluring, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn had been sitting on the broken deckchairs in the tall grass, holding hands, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon, both mentally tuned into the service console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing messages, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer his father had loved to listen to behind closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Nothing was really forbidden, just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, as is obsolete the word.
General taste did what edicts and regulations could never do, and just as people chose books from the dishwasher to the millionaire, memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose ballads for music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailinn's big feet in a grossly comical serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he explained, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
His father used to do that to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that was what was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of one.
Jazz, even if it wasn't strictly forbidden, wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for one if in life.
People wanted to be sure where a tune would end at the beginning.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the musical expression of the mind.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Jr. by the time he was 10, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or coercion.
A conformist society meant that every element of that society would agree gratefully to the principle of group endowment - gratefully as those spared by fate.
Afro-Caribbean people were temperamentally and physically fit for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were, as if by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a working telephone service.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf and Levant whose grandparents hadn't left the country as quickly as they could if something had happened -- for fear of being charged with arson, even for fear that the flames would consume them next -- had opened labneh and shisha pipe restaurants, held back, and became depressed with inaction.
Each according to his ability.
Having heard only ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the insulting words that Beetle had just sung to her could ever be ignored.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except maybe for people with too big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge charcoal-shaped leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers to his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him", he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern's view.
There was nothing to see in the whole world but her uncombed black-haired raven.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so", she said, without any conviction.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too soon.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you", he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted there.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her lounge chair, knocked over the console and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Hollow-flowered wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like a palm branch in a storm.
"And your fat head is exactly why I'm perversely attracted to you", she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that was in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge, icy ocean broke here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more resentful of what had happened than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from bar to bar, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
You fathead?
They would have given her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They kiss first -- kissing was the most commonly used word for erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the silent love ballads from the console -- kissing first and then hitting.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the kiss itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got up from his bunk like an old man.
She felt lead, too, but the intensity of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him as he moved away - as from a room upstairs her companion watched him - a man grieved by something he had himself conjured up.
Adam is leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen anything like it before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomons' feet.
Several years before the events just described, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, was working on a short presentation on the continuing low- and medium-level violence in the very areas of the country where its reduction, if not elimination, is most likely to be expected, given the money and energy invested in eradicating it.
"Much has been done, and much remains to be done", she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been seldom felt despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some traits turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps at sentimental ballads, is inebriated by stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former rudeness hold rural communities and our urban fabric in its grip, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious feudalism at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate", said her mentor after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to say that", answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again invoked her right to privacy and to refuse to testify.
You're a feminist?
Shut up again.
"I'm not asking this", Luther Rabinowitz said finally, "because I'd be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-judgmental workplace.
We serve a society free of prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort the results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you call "devious" and "raw" might as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
If you keep going on about what has happened, if it has happened, as if it had happened yesterday, you are taking away the vital life force of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country for the past quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the word sung is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand perfectly what you mean", replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we deceive ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened, if it happened, in the first place.
This time, it's not the others we're letting our anger and distrust out on.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To show that you have angelic patience.
"You go too far", he said, "in calling actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you say that they have vented their anger and distrust on others.
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about understanding the past as we are protecting the present, not about us and others.
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"If we are honest with ourselves", Esme dared to add, "no part of society can claim to be well behaved.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done well or badly, what's done is done.
That was back then.
I think that the Commission should be able to do something about this.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, no debt has to be extinguished if such an extinguishment is appropriate and if there is a way to extinguish it.
But what good is the past if we don't learn from it?
The past is meant to make us forget it.
If I may say something about that -
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapse.
"I'll consider your report", he said, dismissing her.
The next day, as she was going to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who, as bystanders described, had been driving into the pavement in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they were targeting police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" who were about to be armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defence Force staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were elements within the police who were actually arming some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage", he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action gave the impression of a coup.
"While no one has claimed to have seized power by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces so far show signs of a coup", he said.
A spokesman for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he was targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
There has been a lot of tension in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the disagreements in his unity government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Production in the euro area at a 13-month low
Production growth in the euro area slowed to its lowest point in 13 months in August, according to a closely watched study.
The final Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, from 51.8 in July.
A value greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders fell and factories experienced outages at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery in the euro area and the threat of deflation at a rate of inflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB President Mario Draghi may make further statements later this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the euro area, similar to those taken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent for manufacturers", said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The industrial PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worrying child, as is Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are no longer working is also not reassuring,' said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fires of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for August is that the sector continues to grow after that".
He added: 'It is obvious that life is quite difficult for producers in the euro area at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are adding to uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, consumer confidence - and are likely to lead to delays or even cancellations of some orders, particularly large orders.
He said it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to introduce some form of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited".
The decade of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, where the children still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific Beslan school siege that killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamic terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst of misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
We found surprising young people who overcame resistance, even though the memory of that terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine, and in which children like them are dying, is now ending.
The girl photographed trying to climb back into the school gymnasium
She was photographed and made famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov as she tried to climb back into the destroyed school gymnasium in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Aida was confused and searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
Both were presumed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't", Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
I still have some shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me", she says.
"This happened to me, and you can't change it.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed behind.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little, and we used to dream about going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish college and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says the siege will always be a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I'm glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and elsewhere.
When I see the picture online of me climbing back to school, I think a lot of people are seeing it for the first time, understanding our disaster and helping to prevent it from happening again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years old) and he survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "My mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand".
He thought she was gonna die after an explosion.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing that she might be dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, took it by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who was outside holding his son, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In reality, Tamara had stumbled out of the hospital with leg injuries, believing her son had died.
After her reunion, she said: "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering", he said yesterday.
But I can tell you, it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play video games with gunshots and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember these kids I played with in the yard who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We'll say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could pick out anything I wanted, and the ride in an open wagon.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffer.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities", said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so bad.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could scream and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how it helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir liked to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot them with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not gotten any better in the last 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is still going on, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for many people, war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles.
When he was little, he suffered from it -- I remember him sometimes lying on the couch, his face turned away from us, for hours.
He wasn't sleeping. His eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17 years older than I am, handsome, intelligent, and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for hours that he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got back on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me, with body parts all over the place.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't have survived in that hell.
"I remember shouting at him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's how life goes on for us, unlike many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose horrible image became a symbol of Beslan's atrocities after the siege
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right: Georgij today
His blood-stained face was marked by fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed in, and my little boy was left there alone for three terrible days", she recalls.
Not alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer that date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a day that goes by that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean it was yesterday, some scenes from those days haunt me all the time.
No one will ever forget this, I promise you.
Stunning: The image of Georgiy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that day Georgy wanted to go to school so badly, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there's even this statue of the weeping George in San Marino.
Georgi doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden in our bookcase at home.
I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world feel our pain because of this image.
Georgiy now says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People study such tragedies over and over again and never know the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of that Boeing in the Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing with this kind of pain.
It takes dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It's been affecting my health and I can still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I later went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is part of my past now.
I won't forget, but I won't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and I'm attending a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to train in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
He was a member of the Russian Communist Party.
The boy who survived being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Fanijev was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It feels like yesterday", says Georgy, who wanted to join the FSB as a secret service officer but was unable to because of the damage to his health caused by the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now, and people say that kids can easily deal with bad experiences -- I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 -- the year after -- was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I'm never going back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in that famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on his laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm doing well physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But my health prevented me from studying at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg, as I had hoped.
I sent in my paperwork, including the medical, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experience.
Children should not know about it and they should not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'm going to the memorial service.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be even more intense for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that it was returned to me.
It stays with us.
Georgy is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's had multiple surgeries, he can walk, but he doesn't play sports.
I'd say he's overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget.
This terrible experience will haunt us forever.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want it to.
I'll never forget how my heart leapt when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.

The baby, carried so touchingly to safety by a special operations unit
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is taken to safety by a Russian special operations command (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory of the atrocities
The world held its breath in 2004 when baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the Beslan siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, has no memory of the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a big happy family, and Aljona and Makhar are both wonderful children", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 Tips for Better Underwater Photography and Video
If you like to take photos or videos underwater, there are a variety of equipment.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family gathering with multiple cameras, all of which are available for under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes to optimize exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check how deep your equipment is operational.
Some cameras are only allowed up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots, because many will fail.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cameras don't usually have one.
Even if you have an LCD, it's difficult to see this underwater, and the right setting is a matter of luck.
So you're taking a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a serial mode that allows you to take a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the farther you get from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you're shooting in a pool, lake or ocean.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.
Get close to the objects.
This is good advice on land, but it's even more important underwater because of the poor lighting.
It's especially important when you're working with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose character made a difference, even in an organisation as gigantic as the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to saving patients from the agony of illness and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors were concerned with diagnoses and diseases, while patients were concerned with something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I didn't feel like it", he wrote in May of this year.
I was having trouble getting up.
As he struggled with flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I'd rather have it now than later", he wrote.
When Juliet was away on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusually and unnecessarily anxious.
There was something in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
He had been skiing in the French Alps just two weeks ago.
The X-ray results were in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the skin overlying the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact cause is often difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients are former smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is asbestos exposure - contact with the fibrous material, once thought to be a "miracle" but now recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the cloth - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another era, it seems to be little more of a concern today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, it kills twice as many people as traffic accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are seeing the lethal effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that it takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and often still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And so mesothelioma has no class barriers, no financial boundaries, no occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores of London to private schools, are no safe haven.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
The fact is that the hospitals where we are supposed to be treated have already been identified as the starting points for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
He found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It seems that there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years training", he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and janitors use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one alive".
How many of us are gonna get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at age 48.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get sick?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to end in Britain, a total of 90,000 people will die from the disease.
Most of them have no idea they're going to die like this.

A brief look at the court records that are often used by victims to seek compensation shows just how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is.
For example, in June of this year Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had been negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in their 20s.
"Before this", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestos", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roofing, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler shrouds, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a 'major health risk' with a potential for death.
However, brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocodilite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major factor in the unusually high rates of mesothelioma".
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have considered herself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of the affected, showing that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure from work or home was probably caused by asbestos exposure in the environment".
Many of these contacts, he said, are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It seems no one can assume that they're safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting that examined the Palace of Westminster shows how people in the heart of government could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movement".
Members of Parliament are often accused of looking out for their own interests, but here it seems the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given a 'clean bill of health', it is now clear that £1 billion of work will be needed over several years to renovate Parliament, upgrade electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs will likely meet at the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also noted that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant regulations".
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine asbestos exposure is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were settled", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he remembers most clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he got this kind of fever.
He was 45 and had just had surgery late at night.
Suddenly I was freezing.
It came on all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised, doctors took x-rays of his chest and placed pleural catheters to draw fluid from his lungs for laboratory testing.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, Abbott's patient came into his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott didn't link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his family doctor took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between the rib and the sternum.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just move on", he says.
I didn't really worry about it that much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's. "They told me it was mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended that he get a lawyer.
Only now did he realize the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos", he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who haven't worked in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos pipes in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably less likely to be exposed to the material.
But many workers who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (as Andrew Lawson did) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to have been exposed to the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals may have been lifesaving for patients, but life threatening for the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had their first asbestos exposure in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemistry classes, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now a common theme on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes as floorboards or shed roofs have asbestos by default.
"It's an industrial poison that's in a lot of our real estate", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a woman with the condition had was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see another Christmas.
The most difficult task was to shift from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being overwhelmed by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to absorb all of this", he says.
I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That's it then".
Mesothelioma is especially insidious because it's our life-support mechanism -- breathing itself -- that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibers inhaled, they can settle in the chest wall, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers", says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach lung tissue, Treasure says, "the respiratory tract pushes them to the edge where the skin is.
It's inherently invasive from the start.
The usual options for other cancers don't work as well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the pectoral fin", he says.
You can't get around that with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy", which "works but does not cure".
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors", says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live a long, much longer life than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling center for fellow patients four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center", he introduced himself cheerfully to the calls.
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He had been diagnosed four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and would likely extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I was gonna quit.
Lawson, however, managed to "put things in a slightly more positive light".
After consulting with several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiac-thoracic specialist at Guy's.
"We had the advantage of not having to be referred, I just called and got an appointment", admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a referral and wait for approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to get the best treatments available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers face another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they go to court in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that even very low levels of exercise were a health risk.
And this is where corporate negligence started to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation", since Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos exposure at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute the deadly asbestos exposure to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incident.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who are fighting back on claims know that time is on their side, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, this year saw significant new legislation that makes it easier for people with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer available.
The Act has created a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court would have awarded them in a normal damages proceeding - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" by the insurance industry.
"This is a deal from insurers to insurers", he says, suggesting that this amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not passed and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that with seven deaths a day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today", Penning said during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasure, he expected to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that has allowed Lang-Lazdunski to have a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt empowered.
"That's the most important thing", says Abbott.
You see that all the time with patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had the surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancerous spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
This is life-threatening.
Abbott underwent six more cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of the tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally very demanding.
You have to think about practical things, like the money when I'm gone, or showing my wife how to set the boiler timer.
When you get bad news, you get negative.
You need to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told my girl that I had a disease that would keep me from growing old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and temperamental.
She told her friends, and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
These conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients, these conversations are not filled with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as it did, in the end, to Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to elect a government, protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday, despite increasing calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is believed to fuel the long-anticipated protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry", said legal expert Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in the elections would be too "chaotic" for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain handed Hong Kong back to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the people choose the head of government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a nominating committee closely controlled by Beijing.
A new clause also says only candidates "loving the country and Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer that saw some of the largest and most publicly-impacted protests in Hong Kong in several years.
The pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is being led by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
Within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters in the rain on Sunday evening.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days for Beijing's announcement, and security measures including police and barricades were tightened outside the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is being exacerbated by the feeling among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values of democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central demonstrations as threatening business operations - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests they talk about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they last", said legal expert Regine Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We don't want to create fears that Hong Kong will spiral out of control.
This is a bad impression for investments.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of proms in the United States is now being carried over to the universities, where freshmen are offered performances by private jet.
We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private planes, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Along with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students get to university with a minimum of hassle and maximum luxury this year.
A company spokesperson said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been launched, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also said that despite the £9,000 per year tuition fees, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today have very different expectations and requirements than students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as being out of place.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice-President for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely detached from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting college this month are facing a cost of living crisis because the financial aid available in the form of loans and scholarships is not keeping pace with the skyrocketing bills for the simplest of living expenses before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at a dorm.
Feminists criticize race and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and chanted, "Hands up, don't shoot", as they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in online discussions among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But as tensions in the Midwest rose and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women were 100 percent about race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, personal essays with titles like "Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About the Oppression of Women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, it meant a major change.
"I don't think you'll find many people in feminism who talk about being white and privilege in such a high-class way", she said.
People felt compelled to speak out about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson highlighted problems that black American women face every day but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can post something funny about myself and my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from everywhere", Mitchell said.
When I post about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk about a relationship in public but not about safety in public?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now combine the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always for raping a white woman", Hattery said.
White women had to be part of the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the divide between white and black women came to a point where white women suffragists like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for suffrage could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to fight for women's suffrage, and black suffrage was to come later", Hattery said.
When you remember these things, you become powerfully aware of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the initial request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to Ferguson's issues - police behavior, racial discrimination - mirrors a time when white feminists were "catching up" with the problems that black women had been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to birth control?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who have built their careers on fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are now trying to understand what this means.
Two weeks after Michael Brown was shot, well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook and posted a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, calling for more white Americans to protest against racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are markedly different in public opinion polls - will lead the change", Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates a more intersectional feminism that addresses race as well as gender issues, some of her comments on race in America are puzzling.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's comments to Ferguson contrast her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pushing itself into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
With U.S. border patrol officers arresting nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also resurfacing - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to re-imagine the issue as a major women's issue, she simply needed to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves", said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonating with women's organizations", she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale.
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig making itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is on a private road in Ipswich and is being offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig with its head on a sofa.
Realtor Connells said the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"The photo was published by mistake and has since been removed", said a company spokeswoman.
In his description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom house".
Although the realtor removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The southwest town of Harvey is home to a new lottery-winning millionaire .
A lottery player from Harvey is up this month.
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with one lucky winner to win almost $1.1 million in Saturday's lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey won the first-division jackpot for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has yet to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profit was making things easier to talk about in the small town southwest of Perth.
It's all the talk in town, and everybody's pretty excited.
We thought we could make a profit like that.
Eight WA winners celebrated Division I victories last month, a fitting end to a few lucky weeks for the state's players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a Belmont couple made a mega-win of $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the winnings allowed them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the Western Division this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked to the gladiator arena
It wasn't just the gladiators who were in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and autumn cold and were completely enthralled by the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful array of exhibitions, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Roman period and its importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting squad of the Amor Mortis gladiator school, which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust fighting skills in the soft sand-paved arena.
Gladiator owner Leonidas proved to be a witty and knowledgeable presenter, sending his men into the ring one after another for heroic duels in different gladiator classes.
First, the "provocateurs" were in line with rectangular shields and short swords, and leg crotches on the left leg and arm crotches on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with breast shield, short sword and throwing plant, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protectors.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who challenged the "Secutor" with a net, a trident and a dagger and, after a short struggle, knocked the boys to the ground.
The swords smashed against each other, the shields squeaked and the larvae flew through the arena, so that one could become afraid for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing Summa Rudis, the muscular referee, kept a close eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era liveable", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organisers of the show, the Friends' Circle of the Roman Canal.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his welcome address.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region but also the Roman culture and numerous structures that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be seen during the Roman period, such as the "aqueduct marble" of the eleven-meter-high and 1,400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society was a comparison of water and energy supply, and Petra Fricke, the managing director, knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is confirmed by Ralph Heiliger, a graduate surveying engineer from the engineering team Two in Rheinbach, who introduced Roman measuring instruments such as the chorobat, the groma and the dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating system that once heated the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left by wolves and foxes two millennia ago in the clay footprints before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for the Protection of Soil Remnants of the State Federation of the Rhineland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
A farmhouse was found with a dryer for drying grain and grinding.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a series of finds from these excavations in a glass case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa may have existed from the first to the fourth century A.D., until the German invasion of the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser speculates.
The children also played the Roman windmill game, similar to the modern-day windmill game, or they wrote their names on waxboards with metal handles, as did the Roman schoolchildren.
At the stand of the Roman thermal Zülpich, children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the Rheinbach Glass Museum, they could craft glass mosaics and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center, they could use a heavy stone wheat mill to grind flour for a loaf of bread or a cereal.
The visitors drove through the amusement park in the original Roman coach pulled by two coldbloods and passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman Week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman Year 2014 declared throughout the Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations, the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Oberbachem Lay Playground, thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered to remind students of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire is told about his work on the towering watchtower, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a humorous lesson in international relations is given between a group of watchtower "Germans" and a group of Roman immigrants.
The Adendorf primary school is devoting a project week to the theme of Rome.
The aim of the Week is to make the numerous, but often no longer visible, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg once again visible.
A small presentation in the Wachtberg Town Hall will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum Matron Sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting the West African economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealing a severe blow to the West African economy.
The crops are rotting on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has taken a toll on the region.
Some international companies are also already moving away.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one", says Donald Kaberuka, president of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money", says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes in Liberia's second largest market, Monrovia.
Only people who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola can get into the market.
Liberia is the worst hit by the virus, with more than 600 people dying from the fever here alone.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign firms withdraw staff
In all resource-rich countries, companies are shutting down.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees and several international airlines are no longer flying to the regions concerned.
Local merchants and farmers are also responding, with few merchants leaving their hometowns to get supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers don't dare leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less", says Philippe De Vreyer, a Paris-based expert on the West African economy.
For example, a man who usually goes to the market to sell his vegetables would rather stay home.
The population is therefore feeling the effects of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
The stock of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling in the markets.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with a loss of image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The key is how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors may be under the impression "that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia", warns Hugon.
The disease is also affecting the strained national budgets
The disease also affects the already strained national budgets of the affected countries.
The rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets will be severely strained by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged $60 million to help the health systems of the affected countries.
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But in other places, many people already stay home for fear of contracting the disease.
Reservations in hotels are also falling sharply.
The 50th Anniversary of the Rifles
The shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The Tannenwald Rifle Association is preparing for its 50th anniversary celebration from 12 to 14 September.
We're having a big entertainment night with the Village Rockers on Friday, September 12th.
Saturday night, the big bullfight is at 6:00.
Then, in the big tent, the mood evening with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzboam".
The Blow Orchestra Makes the Music
Highlights on Sunday are the Sunday service and the 9:30 a.m. parish church service and the big parade at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, the award ceremony for the federal and local shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 bridesmaids and their dirndls.
The main chapel is the Berngau Blasting Chapel.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association was founded for "social entertainment by means of practice in room-holding and small caliber shooting".
The Nazi regime had dissolved the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men meet again, who on 30 April in the Lukas guesthouse raised the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as marksmen through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly about finding a clubhouse and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the shooting club started in the guesthouse "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sport shooters, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1. Gauliga.
Club records were broken every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the effectiveness of active shooters has increased, so has the number of members.
Since the club's premises in Leininger no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then management, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future home in the basement of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2,700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Pastor Strasser gave the church's blessing for the new gun rooms.
One of the highlights of the club's history was the 44th shooting, which was connected with the solemn dedication of the new flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Rifle Association celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A group of experts was set up in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a boilermaker.
A major challenge for the Böller and the association as a whole was the organisation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngau courtyard last year, bringing it up to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round robin competition
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round-robin competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one KK1 sport pistol team, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has been promoted from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has been promoted from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as goose-stepping, fencing and king ball, club trips and Christmas celebrations are traditional.
The gunners are also present at parish and community celebrations.
Tony Stewart has an accident on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst on lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without speaking to reporters.
Team principal Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed but now focused on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him", Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond, hoping we can do better there.
Stewart had previously crashed into a wall during the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in with pretty good hopes for a good result today", Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out".
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tow truck and the team was packed and ready to go.
Stewart canceled three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to earn a spot in the chase.
He returned to his workplace while an investigation was underway into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. who stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has been made as to whether Stewart will face charges.
The three-time champion was greeted with a standing ovation when he was introduced before the race.
After starting in 12th position, Stewart had already moved into the top 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart on lap 122, Buschs fell.
Car number 18 went out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars hitting the wall.
Stewart continued to race, but fell to 21st.
Looking for a Dancing Youth
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel (left) are looking forward to having teammates.
Like many other clubs, the Jazz groups in TV Jahn provide full-time education in secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have declined sharply.
The demand for young people for a sport that is healthy and enjoyable is growing.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the eight- to 12-year-old group, six in the 12- to 15-year-old group", says the 20-year-old.
With more assets, she says, it would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies".
If you're in the mood for dancing, you can come to the dance gym at the former Hotel Meyer, Freeway 9, on Thursdays from 5 to 6 p.m. or on Fridays from 5 to 6.30 p.m.
"The training regularly starts with a warm-up program", says the trainer.
Afterwards, various choreographies are practiced.
Jazz dance is characterized by the absence of a fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sports and acrobatics are incorporated into the jazz dance.
Of course, the company is not too short either.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance films and have stayed in the dance room", says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group, you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby, and do a lot of things for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dancing, you can also try one of TV Jahn's other offers.
Children and young people can always take a sip of the children's dance/jazz, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop lessons on Wednesdays.
The dance instructor is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance on Monday and Wednesday nights.
If you like discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from across Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting the new working hours for a month and are demanding a return to the 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are continuing, the Director General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The protest by prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the union Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are continuing to advance.
After heavy fighting, which reportedly included Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top leadership without giving details.
Prussian separatists shot down a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters, according to their own account.
About 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the rebels said on Monday, according to Russian news agencies.
Sinking of coastguard ships
The rebels also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coastguard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the 112.ua channel.
Two crew members were listed as missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several villages in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukrainian Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine was also due to attend.
In the run-up to the meeting, all the actors used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was adhering to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a flagrant breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO a partner", Rasmussen said.
The Russian side's documents and statements indicate that they "consider us as an adversary".
The EU is committed to a stronger NATO presence.
Rasmussen also announced his intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A readiness action plan to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have a more visible NATO presence in the east for as long as it is needed", Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree to new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed, according to official data, to new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Ukraine has been without fuel from Russia for weeks because of the dispute over the price of gas.
The EU's Energy Commissioner, Günther Oettinger, was the last person to mediate between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says the toll will come "quite clearly"
The Chancellor is once again making a clear commitment to this.
It's not a waiver for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU about the car toll have increasingly angered the CSU.
After continuing opposition from her CDU, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out in favour of introducing a car toll.
"To be clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come", the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU summits in Berlin.
But Merkel did not settle on a detailed model.
The black and red government programme mentions 'certain parameters'.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The NRW CDU, however, insists on its no to a single toll on all roads.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
In addition to this, he also discussed with Dobrindt other ways of mobilising more private capital for infrastructure investment, including broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "Mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house was considering a concept to reward highway investors with tolls after the 2017 election.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer warned against developing a tariff plan against the leader of the government.
The CDU deputy federal minister Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all regional and federal roads would be paved", said the CDU leader in North Rhine-Westphalia.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will speak again on the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU-Länderverbände Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The reason for this is that there are fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition allegiance from the ranks of the CDU because of the criticism of the toll.
The left considers the plans a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead", party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette requirement on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
The coalition agreement does not allow domestic car owners to be charged extra.
The Commission has therefore decided to grant them full compensation for the toll through the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model must not, under EU law, place foreign drivers at a disadvantage because of their nationality.
Genetic Disorder Often Misdiagnosed
A British woman says that as a result of a misdiagnosis, she thought for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived most of her youth believing she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with CMT because so little is known about the disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are thought to suffer from CMT, which can cause motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait, and crooked toes.
Patients also experience numbness or pain, and the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she had Friedreich ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor survival chances.
Rodgers thought she'd be in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two, now 51, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do what others did.
I kept falling and everything took longer.
I could never skate or skate with the other children, and I was often teased in school for my walking and running.
Rodgers said that at age 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her legs, she looked at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society", she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and slowly lose all my skills in between.
I did all this on my own, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not declined as much as she had imagined, and she consulted her doctor.
He just stood up, and he hugged me and he said, "Honey, I don't think you have it, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic testing, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained CMT to me, I felt like a winner", she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Staff Sergeant a. D. Berni Diether works as a firefighter since the former military training ground was closed
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has been without firing squad.
Yet, every month, lethal munitions are still being found in the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be detonated on the spot.
A deafening bang echoes from the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectare site has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to walkers and cyclists on 13 marked trails.
Tax burden on business owners in the Washington area rises as the economy recovers
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local corporate tax returns in the country rose slightly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and Washington-area businesses were no exception.
Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid a combined $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining rates in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Ernst & Young service agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax rate at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate property values, the researchers say, which has led to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of this profit came from large states like California, New York and Texas, the trend seems to be the same for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 -- a 4.2 percent increase over the year.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes account for just over a fifth of corporate tax returns.
Businesses in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that a lot of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by nonprofits that don't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to provide the same services as other states.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the housing market
Corporate revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Businesses in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not increasing equally in all three places.
The increase rate in the District was in line with the national average of 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland was much higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate in all three jurisdictions (all three have fixed corporate tax rates), at 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District's is a relatively high 9.975.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia charges lower state and local corporate taxes and has a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the District.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to lower its corporate tax rate from 6.9 percent this year to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to as low as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are paying more in state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners -- a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized under -- in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes combined.
Researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with overall tax revenue for state and local governments increasing 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could fall behind if the federal government's spending cuts affect the region's labour market.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination in China too.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city", said the vice party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during a visit to his city by an SPD delegation.
The official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly referred to this concern of the twelve million-strong metropolis during the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, Li said.
The people therefore also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, promised the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life", he added at lunch with the party chief in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already exudes this joy of life, he flattered the host.
The official from Guangzhou offered a shepherd's croissant - but with red wine served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity standard.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again", the local politician said convinced.
"The trade between our two cities continues to increase".
Currently, travelers have to take the detour through Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the air link.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea", shepherd-gumble replied - Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, a close acquaintance of Germany, nodded in agreement.
A well-kept partnership
The friendly vice-party chief from Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in that function.
He took office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations.
Local Party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the Party and administration, which is being vigorously enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his Party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was a senior official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The link to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometres away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example through a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese link was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as powerful as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, it wants to reach a GDP of 250 billion euros, Li said.
Joan Rivers family "thumbs up"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today expressed hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all have our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, according to sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with her condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many quarters, including overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Cleaner vacuums and rising wages
Cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market today will be subject to stricter environmental standards in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be labelled from 1 September, giving the buyer a glimpse of key data such as the energy efficiency of the appliance.
For new cars, higher nitric oxide levels are applicable in the Euro 6 emission class.
The Commission has also decided to increase the amount of aid for scaffolding workers, who receive a national minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion .
Amazon just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion.
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be acquired, but because there was widespread speculation that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion dollars was a done deal, and the partnership seemed natural.
Twitch, which was launched just three years ago as Justin.tv, started as a general streaming service -- a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players to publish their best performances in games, a "YouTube for live games", according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which experts give the (mostly older) games a touch of science fiction, is already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube was trying to buy Twitch was taken a little bit bored, a textbook example of a major tech company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't happen, since the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster".
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to fathom the appeal of watching others play instead of taking control of the game.
It's one thing to watch a friend at 3:00 in the morning as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a nutcase get shot 20 times in a row in his head in Call of Duty.
You could be watching all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without control over your perspective can be a really good prescription for headaches.
I admit, the fast-paced runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless he's got a game or a comedy pro on board, his Twitch channel probably isn't that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic spikes.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money off of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would love: thousands of young men to be wooed as advertisers.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Castle at the Castle Garden Festival on Saturday.
The organizers' concept was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
At times, the entry had to be stopped.
"That was annoying", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt shakes the light and fun.
Two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem, formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun will come on its own.
This was evident early Saturday when the first visitors set out for the open air.
The organizers had promised a party for all generations.
And they did.
Around the supply stalls on the Burggartenwiese, salt-weeders and guests from the near and far surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They were watching the first live shows, taping with their feet, enjoying cold drinks - in short, pure relaxation and enjoyment were in vogue.
And that's been going on for generations.
While some were lounging on the white sand on the beach bar, others were enjoying a quarter of a glass of wine in the wine cellar, the youngsters were reveling in the hop-on hop-off, which was a major attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of children's makeup, the volunteers literally had to work hard to keep up with the demand and to create imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones used the kick tables or participated in a skateboarding workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew of saltwater crocodiles.
Until the big rain came.
Just before 5:30 p.m., it crashed down on the visitors, especially families seeking the open and dry.
But this did not diminish the attractiveness of the festival.
"There were more people than expected", said Ron Sem, who described it as a "success all along the line".
So there's no reason why we can't have a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked out, Sem made it clear in a first review to the People's Voice on Sunday.
He said it was annoying that the entry had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company was understaffed.
As a result, some who had already paid stopped coming to the site.
The MRI was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who were reveling in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound system.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke off their performance because of this.
The engineers were unable to create a sound halfway reasonable.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be moved to Salzwedel due to a flat tire.
"But next year they will be there", said the organizer.
The opening of the Amula open-air was more than successful in terms of attendance.
And that's in bad weather.
However, the organisers made some mistakes which will be forgiven on the first occasion but will have to be rectified on the second.
The organizers also have to take criticism on the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more", says Melanie Meier on the event website.
"You have unfortunately taken over a bit", says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others see the initial problems less closely.
I think it's great that some people don't just talk nonsense, but actually try to fix things.
Hats off!" wrote Stephanie Jenß on the Amula.
Now the organisers have a year to put down these criticisms.
New radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
It's not what you'd expect.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is part of a larger initiative: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observatory TIRA, the shell, known as the radome, is being completely renewed.
The new radome will be slightly smaller than the old one, with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still holds the world record.
The final step in completing the new shell is to replace the head
The upper quarter of the old hull is cut off and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is laid.
If the weather permits, the action will be on stage early this week.
Ice bucket contestant twists her jaw
Isabelle Roberts, from Britain, cried so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went horribly wrong.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so loudly at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she sprained her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts, from the United Kingdom, screamed so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her head that it broke the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing it, my jaw just stopped", she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't. My jaw was stuck. Then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw it too, and they almost laughed themselves to death, but I had to go to the ER.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to hospital to have her jaw straightened after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was linked to thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs be back together soon?
There was a constant dispute between the two Wolfratshausen castle associations.
Now the board is thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshausen Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshausen Castle Friends, led the project in Guédelon, France.
Even a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshausen Castle and a possible reconstruction have so far been very different.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: talks on a joint approach are soon to be held.
This is confirmed by the association directors Torsten Sjöberg (City Association) and Herbert Piffl (City Friends) when asked by our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we sit down", Sjöberg reports.
He believes that all members of both associations could be drawn back together in the future.
This will make it easier to see results.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until the last a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "identification and experiencing" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Friends of the Castle, said he was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in charge of the friends of the castle.
A new chairman is to be found at a meeting of the members in mid-September.
The 74-year-old said the club currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we suspended our club activities out of respect", he said.
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the castle association.
Until then, the castle friends could also get an up-to-date picture of the mood within their group.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself". He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolf House.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but would very much like to continue".
The differences in viewpoints on reconstruction will probably continue in the eyes of Piffl for some time to come.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar projects already well advanced in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a castle in the air.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which have not yet adopted the measures.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first too.
But over time I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to continue the project".
There's nothing else in here.
The project could also be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw away the idea of reconstruction". He hopes that the town association may move on this point.
Their goal, to document history first, "is important and good".
After that, you could move on.
Smart ways to save on college textbooks
Since the cost of college textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, a student in his second semester, Matt Schroeder, came up with a clever savings idea.
He invented a system of borrowing books from students in the secondary school and offered a nominal compensation to delay resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a cookie", said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
He said the books he needed for the last semester cost him $430.
He spent $120.
The college administration reported that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are several cost-cutting options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than buying one.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 university bookstores, reported that textbook rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, said Tevor Meyer, Neebos vice president.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books cost only a third of what they are at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying used
If you don't mind the notes of others or normal usage traces, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com on a secondhand copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business".
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous editions were acceptable.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased at a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after the course is over.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could rent calculus for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms and conditions of the store you are renting from, including any penalties for writing notes, underlines or signs of use.
Attention tenants, if you do not return the book, the penalty may exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a specific period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's has a six-month lease on Calculus for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, since many classics can be downloaded for free today, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure we'll have a look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for book pricing, as it's a way to be sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, Gault says, you should check that the book is actually in stock.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had a four-week delivery time and ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Wasn't a Box Office Hit
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" grossed less than $30 million on its $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only grossed $12 million on its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's "Sex Tape" earned just $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon Tame 2" also disappointed at the box office.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children's films may be the reason.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" for children's films to date, and described "Dragon Tame 2 Made Easy" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, for films aimed at a somewhat older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer movie launch that was shown between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and on at least 2,000 screens in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of moviegoers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are on a par with last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book movie, told the Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing".
We have to accept that and not try to go back to the past.
In contrast to the current weak box office performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated $1.2 billion in streaming content revenue, almost double the $837 million in revenue it generated last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized movie studios for focusing too much on comic book adaptations and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office receipts as simply "cyclical", telling Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the box office, and nobody will worry about business anymore".
When the second table tennis district class was abolished a few years ago to streamline the league classification, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has added an additional third Bundesliga to its programme.
The result is that those who have not ascended have descended.
The Torpedo team, Göttingen's highest-ranked team, has avoided relegation to the top-flight, but will only play in fifth-tier next season.
Fourth-ranked Torpedoes remain ladies, despite their glorious run to the regional.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys of SC Weende.
SG Lenglern and Torpedo Reserve are competing in the new Bundesliga, but no Göttingen clubs are represented in the Landesliga.
In the women's section, TTV Geismar plays in the Bundesliga, Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district super league south.
The competition is open to all clubs from the region and the European Union.
In the district league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are with us from the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are the first teams to take part in the district league.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends his girls to the little league.
The SCW boys' district league season - Torpedo II is still starting there - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
The West season is the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
The East Division is contested by Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The women's league is composed of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
It's still better than in Osterode County, where there are no women's teams at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six secondary school classes reaches the required strength, and the innovative and agile district manager will have to think about this.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests this weekend by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, some 150 people gathered in Cardiff outside the city hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers Flying Out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bushwalkers were taken to safety by the ropewind after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains of NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after noon Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and emergency services set out and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 11pm.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescue workers stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition by ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators, armed with sticks, damaged equipment in the newsroom.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said clashes between about 3,000 protesters and security forces broke out on Monday about a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend when protesters tried to break into Sharif's residence.
They are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without violence" after a meeting at army headquarters on Sunday evening.
The statement added: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has raised concerns about a military intervention, which has been pushed more often in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been going on since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had urged their followers to persevere on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign", Khan said.
Qadri made similar remarks.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the May parliamentary election last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially held out peacefully outside the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to storm Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer, after their second win of the season, third in the standings.
With Grödig 2-0 up, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating", said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a mid-table with a knockout in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was extremely important", confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who moved up to third place with the green and white.
Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the break of the national competition with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction", said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the pace for victory with his glorious lead volleyball from the sixteenth hole in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd just blow all the frustration out of Thursday and just put it under the bar", said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel hit for the last time in a Bundesliga game on 13 November 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship match in the rapid dress will therefore remain in his memory.
"This is something very special for me, I'm a member of the rapid generation", said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvic bleeders, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there too.
He's got enough experience to handle this position in a mirrorless fashion.
He deserved the goal, he has already made some assists this year", praised Barisic.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after just over an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written to me.
"Thank God we had some luck today", said Schrammel, alluding to the gap between performance and results in recent weeks. "The results were not right, but the game was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that "in many previous games you were better than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26 proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that it has character".
He's just as pleased that we've finally lost again.
A lot of work during the break also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several misses to regret, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting debuts, makes the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget this", warned Barisic, who has lost players to Behrendt and Pavelic in the past three days, "who have been very stable lately".
The break in the international games must therefore be used to "lick wounds and gain some weight physically", explained Barisic, who has five U21 players in his ranks.
One of the people who's particularly in need of a break is Captain Hofmann.
He's torn for the team, he's overcoming pain.
He has shown that he is a very important player for us, especially at this difficult stage", said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the Rapids the structure of the game before being substituted in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who played his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal from the game since 2 November 2013 (4-2 over Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't think that everything is fine now". "We've certainly had a little luck, but eventually the luck must come back to us.
Now it was high time", said Hofmann.
He did advise that we should concentrate on further work: "You can't always see it as black and white.
We haven't been playing as badly as they've been portraying us.
But we must not think that everything is fine now.
He couldn't deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team, and I can help them a lot right now.
They stick to me at certain stages", Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself or his team.
He regretted the quick counter-goal "from the category of magic goal", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been unfairly withdrawn by referee colleague.
The only criticism I can make of the team is that we weren't specific enough towards goal in some phases.
We were undergraduates.
In the end, the team was able to win the match and the match was won by the Netherlands.
I mean, there would have been more to it.
There's peace beneath this hill
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle assignment for the summer series "My Piece of the Rhône Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the county, the one pictured is the "Geißruhe" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy path leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It passes through domes, basalt piles and basalt lakes.
A little bit below the stone quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
The natural monument is vital in appearance, towering above the other trees in the area and resembling an American mammoth tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, only clues to the origin of the name have been found.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishops' Home Archives and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what the situation is with the Geißruhe.
The result of his research was a rather sober explanation for the name.
Up until about 80 years ago, goat herders were said to have driven their flocks from Unterweißenbrunn to the painstakingly cleared and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the climbing-weary rangers are said to have rested.
The area has since regained its importance, as the meadows are actually grazing goat herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider said.
However, caution is advised when entering the rock formations, for the sun-warmed basalt is also a popular stop for the red-eared slider.
A path leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other routes are marked upwards in the direction of Hochrhön and invite you to go for an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
A water tower, however, is rarely found at this height.
The reflection in the trench gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the county that could fit the building's counterfeit.
Where is our "Rhon's piece of happiness"?

After weeks of wrangling, Italy's Prime Minister and current EU President Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative opposition at the EU summit last week, has won the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, replacing Britain's Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reports, sees the appointment of Mogherini, who is also his favourite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects it to give a boost to his 'reform package' in Italy.
The European Union is also committed to the development of a common defence policy.
The European Parliament has also expressed its concern about the situation in the former Yugoslavia, which is still in crisis.
The EU's chief diplomat will also become the Commission President's deputy.
The European Parliament's approval is still pending.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have described the nomination of the 41-year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has been in the party's top posts for nearly two decades and is known for her ambition, will rise to the "enormous challenges".
The native of Rome is married and has two daughters.
She started her political career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic centre party Margherita in 2008 to form the current Social Democratic Party.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Left Democrats' Party Council, she entered high party politics, working in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It has traditionally focused on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, has become known through studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and has maintained contacts with the social democrats in Europe and the democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD is now in a better position than the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40 percent of the vote in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has a part to play, as noted in PD circles.
The report also stresses the need for a European strategy for the future.
In Brussels, especially in Poland and the Baltic countries, Mogherini's realistic approach to the crisis in Ukraine is being met with suspicion and is being defamed as a pro-Russian policy.
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gazprom, which will transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to ensure Italy's energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini made her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos of her shaking hands with Putin were met with outrage in Brussels, as was her invitation to the Kremlin chief to an October economic summit in Milan.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training course in the company.
The new employees will be employed in four training occupations: electronics technician (three trainees), mechatronics technician (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All the Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees had previously attended primary or secondary schools and vocational schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages and trainers will attend a team building event in Oberammergau, which will include a full-day hike and rafting on the inn.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees in all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order", said Francois Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain by his side", he said to great applause.
As a soothing gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce calls for a relaxation of the regime by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday Mr Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show their "unity" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw a spanner in the works when she spoke at a meeting of dissident Socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking away the French people's "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant trench warfare and said she could not imagine the new Valls government lasting more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but neither does Prince Manuel Valls, and they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter either", Ms Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and said she was confident of winning an early election and was ready to form a government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March local elections and the right-wing National Front won the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is in danger of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and bring record unemployment.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises .
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about $3 billion, according to industry insiders.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could end in a draw.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 per cent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues in 2013 were $2.57 billion, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported 2013 revenue of $1.2 billion, up 6 percent from the previous year.
The cruise industry is worth about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among the cruise operators for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed for an IPO with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28 per cent of the shares, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8 per cent stake in the company, according to regulators.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together hold 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original IPO filing for Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A group loyal to Beijing waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates to run in the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee expected to be made up of members loyal to Beijing.
The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and has prompted pro-democracy activists to carry out their threat to paralyze Hong Kong's financial hub with Occupy Central protests.
Political reforms have long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing white paper in June outlining China's dominance over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the election process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city's business district and staging a sit-in.
The survey is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Affairs Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, were to be questioned later in the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
The British did not envisage any democratic elements in Hong Kong until the final phase of 150 years of colonial rule.
Putin demands that Kiev start "statism talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statism" of the breakaway region, according to Russian media reports.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine would have to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian rebels, however, fits into the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the unrest five months ago: helping the separatists to take territory and pressuring the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya to become de facto independent in an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state television Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope for soon peace talks are "trapped in their illusions" as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the October 26 elections and as government groups attack civilian communities in separatist-held areas, reported Itar-Tass.
"We must immediately start detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, to protect the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
The EU has a responsibility to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme is implemented in a way that is consistent with the EU's nuclear strategy.
This is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine".
The clarification by the Kremlin spokesman to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict polls showed a large majority in favor of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which Russian diplomats have been talking about in international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine the authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over a territory that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian legislation should consider constitutional amendments after new elections, giving the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whom Moscow is accused of arming and inciting.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with separatist leaders follows a further rebel advance last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasowsk in a move that Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
This is why massive civilian and military preparations have been made to fortify Mariupol, a steel port of 500,000 people located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which are to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said in Kiev on Saturday.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, believed to have been trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowaysk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Noble made no secret of his anger at hackers who allegedly stole nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood A-listers.
The movie world is in a frenzy after a series of unexpected photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence surfaced online in a celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible for this allegedly has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "Tribute to Panem", and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Private photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also reportedly leaked due to an iCloud breach.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noble, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting".
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, now in New York, reportedly said the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected "felt hurt".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her lying naked in a pool upstairs.
Palmer's film credits include Love Is Invincible with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning were not available for comment yesterday on the hacked images.
A Lawrence spokesman told TMZ: "It's a heinous invasion of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked photos from a cell phone is nothing but selling contraband".
From a legal point of view, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg and have supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was a light training for others.
But one thing they all agreed on was that it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery rode his bike yesterday to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the little muscle pain, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg for the benefit of the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know I can do it now - great!"
A little break on the way to the applause curve?
No, if I'd stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is a CDU member of the Upper Ursel city council, many of the 718 participants were tormented by the early morning dew yesterday and arrived on the plateau near exhaustion but happy.
Others, on the other hand, had an easier time covering the seven-mile [11 km] distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The all-red Green politician from the district council - red dress, red bike - understated a bit at the start ("All the professionals, that's the goal!"), but then he proved to be a semi-professional on the mountain and walked through the finish line after 45 minutes without breathing trouble.
He too ran the course in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be involved - we would have done a ride today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning and was about to step back up.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had been home at 9 o'clock in the morning, had been in the saddle, had "made" the Feldberg twice, and then had been rolling home with fun.
I had fun with "Fried Tony".
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, bike rides over the Feldberg are simply part of the job.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes on his 6.5 kilogram race bike.
It was a crazy event.
I am happy to be involved in this", said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainz man describes himself as an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must be, because he was riding the "fixie wheel", which is a race bike, but without the circuit...
The fact that climbing was easy without a bicycle was proved not only by the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and the fox dance to the summit, but also by a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a rope.
Mountain guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who was working with his team, equipped with an all-wheel-drive Bully and a quad, to ensure safety, said: "I know this one from Frankfurt who is training for a special sled train, only he pulls the sled himself".
The 718 participants - a record number - had been sent out in groups in the morning.
The walkers first at 9:30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Riding on the Great Field Mountain" association, gave the starting commands and wished the participants a pleasant trip.
He hopes to block the route up the field mountain for the safety of the participants next year.
