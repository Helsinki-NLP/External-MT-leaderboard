USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need on the part of the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC has said, that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be best served by bringing about a significant change within our organization, not by decertification.

Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but it provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish brown on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the lower part.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage lacks the basic structure, the so-called tail, but has other features typical of feathers, beards, and barbels, the researchers concluded that the tail was probably the result of evolutionary development following these features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers speculate that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult plumage and not chick plumage.
The researchers hypothesize that although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not that of a chick.

The brightness is used together with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity relative to the magnetic inversions.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for must be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in this galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same as those of "normal" matter.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is gathered in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement made in an interview, this new variant was "highly worrying and alarming, because of the high mortality rate".
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the germ inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital itself.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter a secluded booth and put a printed sheet indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified his identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988 the ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can attest that there are no ballot boxes at the beginning of the voting and that no other ballot boxes are inserted in addition to those of the voters, duly numbered and authorized.
The candidates may send their representatives to assist them at every stage of the process, and in the evening, the volunteers carry out the counting of the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the top-seeded Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their downhill, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police has managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have also recovered her cell phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash was injured.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She is being held pending trial and sentencing, but any testimony from an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters, as Scottish courts have found the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the judicial proceedings, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the formal indictment.
According to leaked information, the document will be about the disputed borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues reportedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such a presence for five years only.
The shooters in the experimental program for controlling harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS, in partnership with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety briefings.
Martelly was sworn in as a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth interim election in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 more incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the Ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "absolutely deplorable".
The Mariana earthquake was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, there have been no reports of damage in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released immediately along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over for an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career as a physician.
After training as a midwife, she went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While on hospital duty, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight records on Wednesday.
His wrestling buddies also wanted to pay their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman".
"Luna was as weird as me... maybe more... I love her and I'll miss her... let's hope she's in a better place", was Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment.
According to the poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those surveyed, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Contrary to the poll, 29% of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but has been blamed for several disorders that have led to doubts about his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication needed to overcome the pain because it's banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, the material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists are eager to understand how planets form and especially how the earth, which collided with comets long ago, formed.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He says speculation is nothing but "political chatter and idiocy".
There's a possibility of a presidential bid in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being provided and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or interchange parking facilities available on site.
Fears about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
A new species of bird has been found on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
They can be worked into any shape. They can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be drawn to form a thin wire suitable for twisting and braiding.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, and has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated codes" because of its ability to be rendered so thin.
This is called the pH of the substance. Using the juice of red cabbage it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of cabbage changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the test chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons ripped away (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them in a ball.
The moisture on your hands and the outer layers will react to create a strange sensation and form a shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water and a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, the remains of sewage systems have been discovered.
Bathrooms in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted into public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world tremendously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
His invention gave birth to the train, the automobile, and various other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on smaller, considerably more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is their niche, a particular goal that each cat has and that allows them to avoid competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all the felines and live in large groups called packs.
The flocks are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and young that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to one another, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion herd acts much like the wolf or dog herd, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large felines), even as regards deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: The tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a traction force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it is more like a phrase of screaming and rage.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and when they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that octopuses track and find prey by smell, sniffing out where on the ground they have been.
Night-vision enables them to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots blend in with their surroundings and then swoop down on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so to pose as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans expel (through exhalation).
Plants process their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our homes with plants, we make our clothes with plants, much of the food we eat is made from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws bore more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a bifurcated tongue, that his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with it.
Although much of their food would seem familiar, Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent called the ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed feasting together by lying on their sides as they consumed their meals.
Of course, the ancient Romans' meals did not include several foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the god's dwelling.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
With the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not of primary importance.
Much of the Jewish family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were simple outdoor benches facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so wood was especially expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all of them were "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Templar Mystery", you might think that there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, probably, the annotation was just meant as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing skirmishes had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. This offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were moving toward Germany.
Civilization is defined as a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in a collaborative manner, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil; the term is in turn connected with civis, or citizen, and civitas, or city or city-state, and in some way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and thus do not come to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, and Congress was the only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, in the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
It didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and interstate duties.
To amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was required, and the states had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most prevalent in the northern regions and see Italians committed to competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago" because of the island groups that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through soon registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of the aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces; in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Many of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today, and, more important, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered to be 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds, either vertically or horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having grown rich and powerful, found itself under examination.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had been a bond between the nations of Europe, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone, from kings to common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money reserves exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has caused many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating the generally accepted international law and codified by multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain was mining international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City and this led to his moving to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different time periods were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division among provinces, the most notable of which was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these times, many of the nobles fighting for the throne fought fierce wars.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent times in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to gain a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Besides, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since the Army's rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond the earthly life, and he used to go to a cave known as the "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you knew it existed, because once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the world around you.
Of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one to have survived intact.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and minor temples were built to honor the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The 'upward-arching' indication looks like a V and the 'downward-arching' indication looks like a staple or a square without a lower side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the armrest (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow results in a stronger, more distinct sound.
You may decide to add your own personal pencil markings, but keep in mind that the arcing marks you find in print have a musical valence, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, together with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and the interest on the bonds was oscillating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous gains from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time in which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that the destiny of man is moved by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves an expansion of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The mass ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, customs and culture related to this geography arose, which, being in harmony with the context of society, proved more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similar to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its prestige declined, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The high point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slowness of the communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the era, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of an organic type, using preserved seeds from the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to get the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel unrepresented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or "wild" and some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has been cared for, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning mode, much less a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, so in other words, a teacher is an example of scaffolding, but so is the little, graffiti-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, prompt and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are put into foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, if not extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn't provide them with nutrition, care and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that the foster home represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster parent is supposed to provide for any unmet needs in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships".
The use of video recording has made significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, new genetic variability is added, with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition and, eventually, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand, (such as ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In view of all this, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (1060 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively quiet wake-up to bring you into a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm include the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace that is in proportion to the tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana Rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the centerpiece of Tibetan meditation, where the depiction of various deities cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and develops the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts caused a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and it would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans soon proved obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading Poland's eastern regions, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way of moving large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Marines has always been to guarantee the country's ability to move people and goods, while countering the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most recent and most notable examples of this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, during which the Americans were trying to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by ancient cultures and tribes for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually raised in free-roaming herds on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although consisting merely of parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
Beams were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This became common practice, even though the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first known means of transportation for man were his legs, and humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, was not used to walking upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate some of the future suffering, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even become activists.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, while problems have increased because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the John Dunlap printing plant a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, known today as "The Dunlap Manifestoes".
The document was first publicly read on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops stationed in New York on 9 July, while a copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 known Dunlap borders are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and that is what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet, birds have many characteristics in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaled feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers used today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and its symptoms, including vomiting, are so generic that they make immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites on man.
Both bed bugs and bed bug killers are nest- dwellers, meaning that they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, MS has about 400,000 known cases, making it the leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own best interests, or that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most of the scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows you to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behaviour are decisively dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which is viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be passed on to the offspring are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism involves people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns to drive to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place from which they have just left.
In this back-and-forth dynamic, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges that are falling apart.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to learn to fly, and their ability to fly enabled them to evade predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small trenches to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and the ephimera.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many others believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and other stars), revolved around the earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times the amount of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on earth, reaching six miles in some places.
Twenty percent of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the grandeur and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were at that time well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, all things are composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually more closely resemble the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals, and keep in mind that the periodic table contains a lot of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minute amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Since its invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and to less and less widespread use.
Now everyone writes messages on their computer screens and they never have to go near a temperamite.
We can only wonder what fate will befall the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission bomb.
So, by further splitting the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at its nearest side and 100 km thick at its farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which facilitated the uplift of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and what makes them want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that make them do or not do certain things.
Among the most widely used content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two behaviours can emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the whole operation of the team and do it.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often creates friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as matches may take place in different time zones, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team that each member refers to and sets the standards for each member.
The first is that the learning organisation is a process of learning, and the second is that the learning organisation is a process of learning.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments in an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be considered innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological findings have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, and the area of research is becoming more narrow and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientific research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a huge amount of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite its strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of applications are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are a key part of teaching, and teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is provided by technology through virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great way to share experiences and travel thoughts with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, as their first experiences with blogs are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving his writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be inventive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant bilingual capital, with its art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the pristine beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario uniquely Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated, among them some almost uninhabited wild moors.
If you compare the population, the result may surprise many: In the United States, there are more African-American citizens than Canadians.
The East African islands are situated in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxury beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the Arab lands he also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which runs from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
For female travellers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realise that cultural differences can give rise to what they themselves consider to be harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategic port used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city which was called Daru l-Badya, later called Casablanca by the Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, narghilè and a lot of trinkets, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do some research before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess the state of the fighting that still persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decayed city, but its reputation has kept it a tourist attraction, with an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the UNESCO list of heritage sites in danger, because of the threat posed by the desert sands.
In the Henry Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabian than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to the border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
Covering an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides sustenance to a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily fees are charged for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a sparkling bar chart, made even more conspicuous by the water of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the heavily populated reclaimed land of the northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonists chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of mangrove worldwide, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into inland Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain what remains of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; the area is estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between different districts are often full, it is good to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable, sturdy little Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge has a free vertical space of 15 meters underneath. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its identity and native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can see minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland Pound Sterling (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound Sterling (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley is often also possible to pay with credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on outlying islands, although British and US currency may be accepted Check in advance with owners to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so you exchange the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below the thermometer reading.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem - bison, moose, deer, bear - virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a proper distance, and it is necessary to leave adequate space for these animals, as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, keep in mind that the smells may attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing along or cooking foods with strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands, and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in 1850-1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two harbours, and the most popular are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean-facing beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops, and safe for swimming.
The most popular local beer is a simple, pleasant, refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones might be better for the journey.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee is a foreign idea. 'Espresso' is the short black coffee, the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is the same as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many coral reef hikes are held throughout the year, and accidents from such causes are rare on the reef.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubed geese appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans, and most sharks fear humans and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they do not live actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often make arrangements with certain hotels, but other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can be booked through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get you further documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on the spot, considering this a crucial element of the experience.
To be near the center of the action, you must arrive early and win a space near the music.
Remember that after the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival where the music runs late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time to explore the city, and cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests' spirits up and keep them entertained.
In some places alcoholic beverages are provided by the house, but the state of intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or near-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as it is on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you become stuck.
Rainfall and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the focal point of many visitors' vacations.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips made over land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so standard equipment is all that is needed to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and therefore can be best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, with some events taking place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, the first being in 1964.
If your 2020 flight and accommodation reservation was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among them, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make drying easier, and many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear socks with a straightening device, you can try a hair dryer, if it is available.
Care should be taken not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to treat water and some of these are proven to be more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes many minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you are in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not common in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people are not usually classified as pests.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy duty-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive, as it often crosses isolated areas of vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes peeled, as steep slopes, narrow streets, and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than those applied on the preceding and following sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h).
Strangely, however, the area has much higher mobile phone service coverage than other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighbouring Austria further south.
Fruit cakes are timeless classics, from those with apples available year-round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
Those who want to taste small but richly flavored sweets can turn to the ones that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices mixed with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan curries in the inland regions are usually made with yogurt; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally denotes foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of simple dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The reins are foot supports for the rider and are found hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the running horse.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially in England, have been fitted with safety bars, which cause a leather strap to detach from the saddle when the rider pulls it back in case of a fall.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are cut.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continually trace new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Freediving snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on snow by using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened in 1861 by Norwegians.
Skiing: The activity is also called off-piste, ski alpinism or ski trekking.
It is related, though usually not understood, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on rocky terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a trail similar to the hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you can cover somewhat greater distances than those covered by walking, but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-traveled trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries, you would need to apply for a visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to go through passport controls again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact a piece of antiquity. Some tax agencies consider an object that is at least 100 years old to be such.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit, which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis for many other professions.
Even in the course of time, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer breeding on a large scale; some lived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as work animals.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you are visiting, there could be consequences for your travel health insurance or for your insurance in the event of a cancellation of your trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are directed to the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Adverse weather conditions' is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon which may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of extreme weather, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea storms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal high-intensity weather events include thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered a war zone must undergo vocational training.
A search on the Internet for 'Hostile environments course' is likely to find the address of a local business.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A standard course lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing as well as many first-aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo sex change surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents varies as well.
Security inspections have also become much more scrupulous in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative stage should not expect to pass the screening without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar formations.
Given the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can be formed towards the open sea.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once you're out of the current, getting back in the water won't be any harder than it used to be.
Try to identify an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, based on your skills and if you have been spotted.
Re-entry shock is more rapid than culture shock (there is less honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty adjusting to the culture of their home country.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
In your first experience abroad, you likely met people who were patient and understanding, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not realize that patience and awareness are also needed for returnees.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors, the sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, of which sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, and King George Island is the largest island, and home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception; on the latter, the caldera of a still-active volcano filled with water from its source to a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula and overlooking the sea at Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 200-mile chain cut in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m (15,980 ft) with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only alternative.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational craft, including pleasure boats, as well as missions that require data and voice over distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among recent graduates, since they can take a year to start university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education when returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in such educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing.In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", there are also thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to sail around the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular occurrence (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Many of the various Baltic cruises include a stay of several days in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for land landing (as of 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and in all circumstances, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of, not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people have toward other things.
For some people, a little understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during flight may prove useful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or the fact that you are not in control.
Couriers are well paid for delivering products quickly, and oftentimes, timeliness is very important in the case of company documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it there faster is to send it as a hold bag, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to send bags without a passenger.
To fly first or business class, the most obvious way is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, to convince your company to do so).
However, the price is high: as an indication, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worthwhile to look for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a class of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destinations quickly and comfortably, and they apply certain fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and a major transportation crossroads.
The ancient city of Smyrna is built on a huge bay, surrounded by mountains and is now a modern, developed and active commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more like that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic pink-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church's sanctuary, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Still to the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and it has almost incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived in these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves.
Avoid tarnishing these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it; Spanish is known by almost everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are only in Catalan, and any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are notoriously self-centered, rude and conceited.
Although often a vague stereotype, the best way to feel at home in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, to relate as a "bien élevé" person, which will make your travels much easier.
The rough exterior of Parisians will quickly fade if you display a few basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly of beech, beech and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of different microclimates, soils and altitude levels, it has a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the rooster live in these places, along with several other more widespread species of animals.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stole for women who come to you unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that reach below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, traditional summer dinner: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the available seasonings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, aside from the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "She", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and adjectives.
This probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a substantive form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also, make sure that you pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with your Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
Of course, if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimum knowledge of Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now mostly obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even a "simple" specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting a few specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with heat (always) and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inner Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme to arrange a vacation around.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube, or sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of well-known hiking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian lands and by non-Christians throughout the world.
One tradition involves spending the night of Easter awake in an open place to watch the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual connected with spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the considerable distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, and this led to the giant tortoise becoming the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun stays below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing is usually a jacket and tie or a suit and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes teamwork rather than individual accomplishments.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval on every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
