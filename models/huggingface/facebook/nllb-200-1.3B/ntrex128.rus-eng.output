The members of the Welsh Assembly don 't want to look like the Muppets .
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a growing dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (from English Member of the Welsh Parliament  member of the Welsh Parliament).
The problematic decision is linked to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes about this abbreviation.
One Labour MP, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern about the new abbreviation being p Twp and Pwp.
For our non-Wales readers, twp is Welsh for "stupid" and pwp is "dumb".
According to the Assembly member from the Welsh Party, his organisation as a whole was "not satisfied" and offered other options.
The conservative party does not object to the new abbreviation, but notes that MWP is close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the name change bill, made the following statement: The final decision on how the Assembly Members will be named will, of course, remain with them.
The Wales Governance Act 2017 empowers the National Assembly for Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll of the proposed options, which found widespread support among the local population for the option of the Welsh Parliament instead of the Assembly.
As for the names of the Assembly members, the Committee preferred the option of Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), while the MWP option had the most public support.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but it will be difficult for the Chairman, Mr Elin Jones, to find a solution that satisfies all.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly's work process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the structure of the Committee system.
Assembly members will vote on the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote is meant to resolve a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name "Republic of Macedonia" implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against its northern neighbor's entry into the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Georgi Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on changing the name, has said he will not recognize the results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the country's name change  is merely the price of EU and NATO membership.
Crisis in Harlem parishes: St. Martin's bells are silenced forever
"The old folks I spoke to in the neighborhood said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
Now there's no one left.
The disappearance of bars can be understood:
The format of communication has changed.
The bar was no longer the neighborhood's regular dining room.
But as for the churches, the worry is that the proceeds from the sale of assets will not last long, no matter how much their leaders hope.
He added that a multi-family house would be built on the site, and that residents would hardly support the parishes that remained in the area.
"Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white", Adams believes, "and that brings the day when these churches will be closed down for good, because the new neighbors will never become their parishioners".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first Methodist church members left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish next door.
When St. Martin's Church fell to the black community, it was led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, where blacks were denied jobs or promotions.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, and during the restoration work, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father, who succeeded him as head of St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon the "clockwork for the poor".
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it something else: "cultural heritage" and "unique historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that the carillon from St. Martin's was the first instrument of its kind in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was invited to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's Church has yet to find a replacement.
The last few months have been a difficult one around St. Martin's with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
The parish meeting, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, appealed to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would "try to transfer the cost of the work" to the parish meeting, although the latter had no involvement in the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old lobster-hunting diver
According to official reports, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and sustained injuries.
The attack happened around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hummel, in an interview with KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was diving with friends on Saturday morning and about half an hour later heard the boy screaming for help, and they went to the scene of the attack with their friends in a boat and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was loudly cheering for the lobster, but soon realized that he was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I got bit!
As he approached the diver, Hummel noticed that his skin was completely torn around his clavicle.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water", says Hummel.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and is in critical condition.
The shark that attacked the teenager is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a press briefing that a shark was spotted at the site a few weeks ago, but it was not classified as an endangered species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the public.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to take over the UK perfume and cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to set up a cosmetics and perfume department at Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams with consultants-cosmetologists, modeled after luxury department stores.
The UK perfume and cosmetics market is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while sales in the fashion and home goods sectors are falling. To capture a significant share of this coveted market, as an experiment, 11 stores across the country will be introducing spacious cosmetics and perfumery departments, and if successful, many more stores should be expected next year.
Supermarket owners are looking for a way to fill their shelves, which used to be for TVs, microwaves, household goods, and investing in the perfume and cosmetics market is a good solution.
According to Sainsbury's representatives, the range of cosmetics is planned to double to 3,000 items; including the first offering of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, such as the organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the boutique-cosmetics brand will be reorganized to include vegan products to meet the demands of young women.
Two Sainsbury's stores will feature the Fragrance Shop, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Sellie Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of products every day from small shops near the house have led to supermarkets having to attract customers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainsbury's, says that outlets will gradually become department stores, and his supermarket chain is fighting for customers in a competition with cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sainsbury's supermarkets have Argos outlets, and some of them now have Habitat's stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago, leading to increased food sales and revenue from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to revive its cosmetics and pharmacy departments have failed.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Sainsbury's and Butts was formed, but later disagreements arose between the participants over the division of the proceeds from the sale of pharmaceutical products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of Sainsbury's pharmaceutical business (total 281 stores) to Selesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare products from La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's: "We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more supportive environment for our customers.
We've also invited specially trained counselors who will always be available to help with the board.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location will attract a lot of visitors looking for cosmetics and perfumes.
Peter Jones has reacted angrily to Holly Willoughby 's exit from an £11 million deal .
Star of the show Peter Jones is furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of the £11m deal she had been planning to make with Peter's lifestyle brand, but instead opted for new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint brand of housewares and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Laugh.
Jones was reportedly "angry" when the TV fan favorite, at a heated meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, admitted that after signing new contracts worth up to £1.5m, she would not have enough time left for their shared brand of homewear and accessories, Truly.
Their brand was compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's offspring brand Goop, and it was expected that its sales would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure on Instagram, while Jones himself left the UK on a private jet heading to one of his villas.
According to one of the sources, the Truly brand was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would provide her with a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision stunned all involved in the deal.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, as the stamp was only weeks away from being launched.
There's a whole warehouse at the Marlow headquarters, filled with goods ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the UK's most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, and potential delays in the launch of the line.
It also involves the breaking of a long-standing friendship.
The parents of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took over as chairman of the board in March.
Both couples often holiday together, and in addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Dan Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S and replace Anthony McPartlin as host of ITV's Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We cannot comment on his business dealings".
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media's criticism of him for his "unfit president" comments and positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump dropped so many of his claims?
Trump said that, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I've never given up on anything.
He noted that Kim Jong-un is interested in a second meeting, after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June a significant step toward reducing North Korea's nuclear weapons stockpile.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North Korea still waits for "appropriate response" from the US after the DPRK's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During a gathering of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
"Things are great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a great relationship.
Trump said his efforts to repair ties with Kim Jong-un had paid off: the missile tests were stopped, the hostages were released, and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there was nothing unusual about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street who are rushing into this completely packed hall, there would be only 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, victims counted in the hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake hit Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was left homeless, the government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not need international support, so it was not easy", Selina Sambung said.
Save the Children is preparing a team to deploy to Palu, but we don't know yet if a foreign team will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian authorities are conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine the feasibility of involving international organizations.
Given Indonesia's ongoing seismic instability, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite tsunami warnings, no siren was fired to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transportation between Indonesia's many islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously moored in Lombok to help earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but the journey to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the strengthening of Indonesia's aging infrastructure a highlight of his election campaign and spent countless dollars on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a second term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The president has also been criticized for escalating interfaith hostility between Indonesia's conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more were left homeless by clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, arrows and other self-inflicted gunfire.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge compares score against Chelsea with goal in far top corner of goal
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdhan Shakiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He went left and hit the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and landed in the far upper corner of the net.
Goalkeeper Kep Arrisbalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Sturridge said: "It was all about getting in that position and getting the ball, players like Shaq always play their best offensively, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible".
I saw Kante coming towards me, I took the ball and, without thinking, I hit the goal.
In the first half of the match, Chelsea led 1-0, with a goal scored by Belgian Eden Azar at the 25th minute.
Chelsea's centre forward, passing back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field to halfway to Liverpool.
In the middle of the field Kovacic played for one touch.
Then he passed the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Azar overtook the defence and from the left flank he hit a by-pass to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, hitting the far corner of the net.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play Videotron in the UEFA EuroLeague match, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the National Disaster Management Agency said Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people are still under the ruins of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the official representative of the Department during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was overwhelmed by the debris of the collapsed houses.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of fatally stabbing a woman.
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation is underway.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews complex on John Street.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among local residents.
This is Detective Inspector O'Hagan, who is in the early stages of the investigation, but I urge anyone who has been to John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the VCR, to contact us with any information that may help the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found on the premises.
This afternoon, alleged acquaintances of the victims arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and police are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver, a resident of the Grayson Mews complex, tried to enter his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his speech when he learned what had happened.
Residents were told they would be out of the house for at least a few hours.
One of the officers told the tenant that the entire area surrounding the house was considered a crime scene.
One woman cried.
"What a horror!" she repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene, and another one remained outside the fence.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to monitor the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a personal message to @MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
The Cromwell monument in front of the parliament building sparked a fierce debate about rewriting history.
Cromwell's exile would have been a deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: "As the debate about demolition of historic monuments continues, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the icon-fighting movement during the English Civil Wars.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft reflects the views of his 19th-century contemporaries and the historical achievements of a man whom many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this view is historically accurate remains a matter of debate among experts.
But it is safe to say that the conflict that arose in the mid-17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also highly appreciated and respected.
Chinese farmer bitten to death by a killer pig
A farmer in a market in southwest China was killed by a pig, local media reported.
The victim's bloodied body (only his surname, Yuan, is mentioned in the media) with a ruptured artery was found near a barn in a market in the Lupanshuy district of Guizhou province in southern China, the Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, May 30, 2005, Xin'in District, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin found Yuan's body, with the door to the next pigsty open.
There was a huge shrimp with blood on the rim in the pigsty.
Forensic examination found that a 250-pound pig bit the farmer to death.
"My brother's legs were bloodied and mutilated", Wu, a relative of the victim, told the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was being kept in a separate pen for the duration of the investigation to avoid further attacks.
It's reported that Yuan's family is negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer's death.
It's rare for pigs to attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and let go, only to be frightened by his overgrown wife.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon, U.S.A., was eaten by his own pigs, and a Canadian farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a "trigger mechanism".
Pigs are playful.
They're biting and very curious, but they don't mean to offend you.
You just have to instill a sense of measure and respect in your animals, he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to much of the southwest
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves through the cooler waters to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring heavy rain and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of 135 km/h, 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Euchenia (Mexico).
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, and as it approaches the coast of Southern California, the storm will bring tropical moisture north of Mexico into the southwestern United States.
Mexico is expected to see more than 25 centimeters of rain on Monday.
Tropical moisture is expected to fall in the low pressure zone, and heavy rain is expected in the southwest.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous torrential floods, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, rainfall can reach 5 to 8 centimeters per hour due to high tropical humidity.
In some areas of the southwest of the United States, mostly in much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be up to 510 cm.
The risk of sudden, rapid flooding due to uneven distribution of tropical rain is not excluded.
With the risk of tropical rainfall, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Hailstorms can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause gusty winds and dust clouds.
As the low pressure zone builds, it's going to rain in places along the coast of Southern California.
Up to 1.5 cm of rainfall is possible, which can cause small mudflows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
It's the first rainfall since the start of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rains will hit Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and will spread to other areas by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
Tuesday's rainfall will continue in the Four Corners area until Wednesday evening.
In October, temperatures across the United States will be dramatically warmer, with low temperatures in the Arctic and high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination results in large temperature swings over a small area.
The same sharp temperature swings will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will build up and spread to other areas.
In most of the central and eastern United States, early October is expected to be warm, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees Fahrenheit in the area from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
In New York City, temperatures may rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises a high probability of unusually high temperatures on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh was watched by more than 20 million people
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blazi Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew the attention of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels on Thursday.
The political confrontation over Kavanaugh's nomination took an unexpected turn, with a press release Friday that Republican Jeff Flake had proposed that the FBI investigate the charges against the lawyer within a week.
As Ford stated at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, she is 100% certain that Kawano, while intoxicated, attacked her and tried to strip her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave an emotional statement, saying he was 100 percent sure it wasn't.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account average statistical data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures for other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not available.
In addition, Nielsen ratings do not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
By way of comparison, this is the average audience watching a football game in the playoffs or an Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, whose hosts were enthusiastically supportive of Kavanaugh's appointment: the Senate hearings, which lasted all day, averaged 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC  2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, while CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the case did not diminish.
Friday was a real drama starring Jeff Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator from Arizona announced his intention to support Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS were able to catch Flake on camera on Friday morning on his way to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee, when he encountered a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him, with his eyes closed, getting a slap from angry women on CNN live.
"I'm standing in front of you", said one of them.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
You're the power behind it, while so many women are powerless, trying to explain their position as women.
Flake told the activists that his office had prepared a statement and that he would speak at the committee meeting.
When the Judiciary Committee was about to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate seat a few hours later, all the channels broadcast the hearing live.
Flake, however, made one condition: an FBI investigation into the allegations against the candidate by next week, as the Democratic minority had been pushing for.
Flake claims he changed his mind through the intervention of his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
He made the final decision after talking to Koons and several other senators.
Flake's decision took effect, as it was clear that the Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump's ordered the FBI to open an investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of " political games " over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticize her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published on the same page as May's, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Brexit "Shake" plan, saying he found the introduction of tariffs between the UK and the EU "absolutely ridiculous".
Police have arrested Dighton Simpson on suspicion of murdering the Louisiana State University quarterback.
Police have arrested a man suspected of the murder in the shooting death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
Baton Rouge police say 20-year-old Dighton Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the regional CBS channel, police found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed to fatally wounding Wade.
According to Advocate, Simpson is being held on $350,000 bail.
The coroner of Baton Rouge Eastern District on Friday issued a preliminary verdict that the death was caused by a single gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the local residents for their assistance in the search and rescue efforts that led to this arrest.
Joe Aleva, the athletic director at Louisiana State University, thanked law enforcement for their "good faith work in catching the criminal".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3 forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father, Wayne, also played for Louisiana State University.
Last season, Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Coach Will Wade issued a statement Friday morning saying that the tragic death of Wade Sims has been a "shock" and "a real grief" to all players.
"This is what I've always feared", added the coach.
The volcano covered Mexico City in ash
The Popocatepetl volcano has covered the southern suburbs of Mexico City with ash.
On Saturday, Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Center advised people not to approach the volcano, which has been active for 183 days.
The Center observed that there was frequent thunder and tremors near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users have posted photos of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash.
After the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have recorded increased volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl Volcano (or, for its own, Don Goйо) is an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
A multi-thousand-strong rally in Barcelona on Saturday, marking the first anniversary of the referendum on Catalonia's secession from Spain, which split the country into two camps, was not without clashes between pro-independence and police, and six rioters were arrested.
Police officers pushed back the pro-independence protesters, while the latter, wearing black masks, threw eggs and powdered paint at the guards, raising clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After the police fired a stake to deter the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For several hours, the independence supporters chanted: "We will not forget, we will not forgive!" while their opponents responded with the slogan: "Long live Spain!"
According to local media, 14 protesters were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
Last October 1, a referendum on Catalonia's secession from Spain was held, which was declared illegal by the Spanish government, but became a major milestone for the separatists.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to leave Spain, but turnout was low because the opponents of the exit largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block the referendum at polling stations.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the declared path of the demonstration in support of the Spanish police, to prevent it from being held.
The demonstration was still held, but it took a different route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a separatist rally with his wife, lamented that the hope of Catalonia's gaining sovereignty was becoming increasingly tenuous.
Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents cried with joy for the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of suspended animation, he says.
In the recent December local elections, Catalan parties for secession from Spain won a major victory, albeit by a small margin, but this year their movement is losing supporters as many of the movement's prominent leaders are either on the run or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a rally in support of the police, said the conflict was heating up on both sides of the political spectrum.
"The tension is rising", he added.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan separatist leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
"Participating in the next European Parliament elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government", he says.
Londonerry: car crashed into house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonbury was hit several times by a car; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested.
The raid was carried out on Thursday at about 19:30 local time in the Balligard Crescent area.
The blast damaged the gate and the building itself, according to Criminal Police Inspector Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that the car may have been shot with a bow.
Livingston win over Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Mengi 's first goal guaranteed a win for Livingston .
With the goal, Livingston won a surprise victory over Rangers, only the second defeat in 18 games for Scottish club head coach Steven Gerrard.
Dolly Mengi's accurate shot equalised Gary Holt's team with Hibernian in the standings, where they share second place.
Gerrard's club have been winless on the way to the Premier League this season, and they will face group leaders Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points behind Rangers.
On Thursday , Rangers will play their home games of the Europa League against Rapid , Austria .
Livingston continue their undefeated streak in the division, having played six games without a loss since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as head coach.
Missed moments for Livingston in a fight with the aggressive guests
Holt's trainer's custodians should have kept score from the start. The Rangers clearly couldn't handle their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defence, but the goal from his weak attempt failed. Then defender Alan Lithgow, swinging too wide, could not prevent the ball from falling into the net.
The receiving side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their defensive line, expecting dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed that crucial goal.
The Rangers gave up a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a pass to Mengele, who scored from the center position.
By then, the Rangers had the ball in their hands, but the defense was unbreakable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second half continued with the same pattern, although Kelly still had to fend off a blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball away from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow made a wide pass from the standard position.
Balls were constantly being thrown into Livingston's penalty box, but all attacks were repulsed, and two penalty shootout demands - one for provoking reserve player Glenn Middleton with a Halcett and the other for playing with a hand - were not met.
The phenomenal game of Livingston
From BBC Scotland  Alasdair Lamont, reporting from the Tony Makarroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympiad.
Their style of play and composition have remained virtually unchanged since their rise to the top of the rankings, and Holt's greatest achievement is that he mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a splendidly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
And the Rangers couldn't get into the rhythm.
Although they had some good moments with Coach Gerrard, this time they didn't live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they lacked ball possession, and they only managed to pass the defense of the host team once.
Erdogan 's warm welcome during visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine, and both leaders were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries, and the visit was already fraught with some conflicts.
The heads of state have failed to reach an understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow the 25,000-strong crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters were stationed nearby to see their president.
Opponents of Erdogan's regime, including Kurds, gathered at the same location to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to Germany.
The presence of radically opposed views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: motorcycle crashes resulting in death
In London, a car collided with a cyclist, who died at the scene.
The accident happened near the busy intersection of Westwood and Evelyn streets in the southeast part of Deptford, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver and paramedics who arrived at the scene tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without regaining consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile away, on Childs Street, another cyclist was hit by a car and the driver fled.
Police in London are now working to identify the victim and notify his next of kin.
Meanwhile, the roads at the scene have been closed and bus routes have been changed: motorists are asked not to drive in the area.
Riots in Long Lartin Prison: six police officers wounded
According to the Long Lartin administration, six police officers were injured in the riots at the maximum security men's prison.
The Long Lartine Men's Prison in Worcestershire has been undergoing a series of riots since Sunday, which began around 09:30 local time.
To quell the riots, which involved eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado task force was called in.
The officers sustained minor facial tissue damage; they were treated at the scene.
According to a prison official, special-trained personnel were involved in the incident at Long Lartine Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We strongly condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their detention may be modified for a longer period.
Long Lartin is currently holding over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that a prison warden had been admitted to hospital after being attacked by one of the inmates.
And last October, the prison administration was forced to bring in special operations units to calm the angry inmates who were throwing billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rose could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which would benefit the arid areas)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it's lucky: Early next week, Hurricane Rose, having made its last breakthrough, is expected to pass over the deserted Southwest and bring with it the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of torrential flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and rain heavily on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts from the National Meteorological Service, it will rain from 5 to 10 cm, reaching 15 cm in places on the Arizona plateau Mogollon-Rim.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall may be up to 2.55 cm, in some places rainfall may reach 10 cm.
For areas that are bypassed by torrential rains, the rain from Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, since the region has long been plagued by drought.
While torrential flooding can be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the drought season that is not experienced in the Southwest.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought (second in severity category) ,  reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first hit the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, which has a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Euchenia (Mexico) and moving north at 19 km/h.
The hurricane has found itself in a cooler water zone on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its strength.
This afternoon, the storm will reach Mexico as a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall is expected in some areas of Mexico, with the threat of flooding.
From Lower California to northwest Sonora, rainfall could be as high as 710 centimeters, and as high as 25 centimeters in some areas, according to weather.com.
Rose will then move north through Mexico and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical cyclone, reaching southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
The primary potential risk associated with Rose and its remnants is heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwest Sonora and desert areas of the southwest, the National Weather Service said.
The rainfall is expected to cause dangerous torrential flooding, mudslides in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects arrested in attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy has been seriously stabbed, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the attempted murder was found with severe injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After his hospitalization, his condition is assessed as stable.
Four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area that evening, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
Police are looking for any possible witnesses to the crime who have any cell phone footage of the incident.
Donald Trump: "All the hatred, all the hate of the Democrats has fallen on Kavanaugh".
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats", Trump said at a rally of his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
In Trump's opinion, the process of nominating Kavanaugh for the nomination "has destroyed all the hatred, all the malice of the Democratic Party".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday in an emotional statement that categorically denies allegations that Christina Blaze Ford sexually assaulted her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified at her arraignment.
On Saturday, the president of the United States said that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's brilliant mind, class and courage.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an unblemished record of public service", the president announced to a crowd of his fellow citizens in West Virginia.
In his speech, the president indirectly touched on the nomination of Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of Republicans in elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
The most important election of our lives is only five weeks away.
I don't participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different way, he said.
I'm dressed like a firefighter and fighting for our great candidates.
Trump thinks the Democrats have set themselves the task of "doing everything they can to resist us".
According to the rules, the first key vote in the Senate to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy should take place no later than Friday, the Republican Party's top aide said.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many of them in the giant waves that swept the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by a tsunami and earthquake of incredible strength.
Hundreds of guests at a beach festival in the city of Palo were the first victims of the storm, which was followed by waves nearly six metres high that swept the coast at sunset on Friday, killing many of those present.
The tsunami followed the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach holidays instead of immediately fleeing to shelter, and this led to the loss of lives", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an official with Indonesia's National Disaster Management Authority, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, there were cars, logs, whole houses in the water, the storm destroyed everything in its path", explained Nugrocho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at 497 km/h and crashed on the coast with all its might.
Some of those present climbed trees, saving their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photos taken by the Disaster Management Department show destroyed homes, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by the tremors.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
A statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Utilization Agency (BPPT) indicates that the energy released by the earthquake was about 200 times greater than that released by the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been more powerful than expected, due to the city's geographical location at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage "massive", adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings; a total of 540 people were injured, and another 29 are listed as missing.
Nugroho added that casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 kilometers from Palu, in the town of Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications with Dangal were completely destroyed, no information was received.
"The Dungala area is home to over 300,000 people", the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, with staff and volunteers already on the ground.
"A tragedy has occurred, but it is not the end", the message said.
On Saturday, the Authority was heavily criticized for failing to report the tsunami to Palu in time, but authorities believe the waves reached the coast when the initial warning was still in effect.
An amateur video has surfaced on social media showing a man on the top floor of a building screaming about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to get the attention of people on the street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water falls on the shore, taking houses and cars with it.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the authorship of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused major power outages, which severely hampered rescue operations in Palu.
Military transport planes have been sent with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities, government sources say.
The city's airport was only open for humanitarian aid; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centers in Palo will be visited by President Joko Widodo.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision volunteers arrived safely from Dungalla in Palu, where they found shelter in the brick tents in the courtyard of their office building, and Doseba Sinai said they saw a horrific picture of total destruction on the way.
"They saw a huge number of destroyed houses", he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have started to put in place mechanisms for humanitarian aid, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have failed to get to Palu.
Indonesian law allows the attraction of funding, humanitarian aid and staff from foreign organizations only after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is believed to be a local disaster", said Auliya Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government declares a natural disaster national, we can accept foreign aid, but for now the status remains unchanged.
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Palau, friends and relatives of the missing are still hoping for their miraculous rescue, which will restore hope for the better.
A little boy was rescued from a sewer hatch on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the rubble who had been there for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"I'm not the last man in this sport, and emotionally it's hard to live with", he said.
Hendon recalls how, after learning of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse from other paragliders, he spent the next few hours desperately trying to contact his fellow Paluaners on WhatsApp while they were vacationing at a beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray marker instead of two blue ones.
"That means the messages weren't delivered", he believes.
The theft of $26,750 while servicing an ATM in Newport-on-Lively.
Friday morning, the attackers stole $26,750 from a Brink's cash register, which serviced one of the ATMs in Newport-on-Leeve, according to a press release from Newport Police.
According to Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored van was taking cash from the ATM at the entertainment complex and was about to load it with new bills.
Meanwhile, a Brink's employee was approached by a robber from behind and stole a bag of banknotes to fill the ATM.
Witnesses said several suspects had fled the scene, but police did not say how many were involved.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has come up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: "Personality, formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the pseudonym for a long time and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The news comes ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will be the host instead of singer Ariana, who canceled her appearance due to emotional issues, the show's creator said.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
Ye is the most common word in the Bible, meaning you, so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us.
First there was Kanyi, which means "the only one", and now I am only Ye, which means the reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible things in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.
Kanye isn't the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pee Diddy or simply Diddy, this year asked to be called Love or Brace Love.
West's fellow rapper Jay-Z also changed the spelling of his name several times: with or without a hyphen, with a hyphen or a hyphen.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President Lopez Obrador vowed to "never resort to the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful student demonstration, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began that claimed the lives of 300 people.
Lopez Obrador also pledged support for Mexican youth in the form of monthly scholarships for study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational prospects are leading young people into the criminal world.
The U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
China and its AI efforts should not be underestimated  The US should double its investment in its research, says Li Kaifu, an AI investor and entrepreneur with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Previously, statements about AI work have been made by several U.S. ministries, although the U.S. as a whole has no clear strategy for AI development.
At the same time, China unveiled its own plan last year: its goal  to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we expect the next breakthrough in AI", says Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest-ranking player at American Otello, and then he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge by Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with nontraditional thinking.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, says Lee.
It's not the academic leaders that China is absorbing, it's the corporations, Li believes.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring brilliant university minds in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee believes that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence", he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to scientists similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to American researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been in place for months without any action.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Georgi Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for a referendum.
The question put to the referendum was worded as follows: Do you support membership of NATO and the EU, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations like the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", says Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
A sufficient number of MPs have said they will respect the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it does not have binding legal force.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe", says 62-year-old Yosse Tanievski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favor of a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumice, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage, placing chairs in front of tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with our heads held high, not by stepping on the thresholds of the bureaucracy", says Kavadarkov.
Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be the "guarantee of our prosperous future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that's below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telecom-TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those who voted say they would vote yes.
For a referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would be the first major blow to the policies of a pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City bypasses the defence of Brighton to score
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have dealt with Brighton's defence, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored in the 65th minute, it seemed that he had no problem.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine forward received a pass in the center of the field.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green shirts.
He passed one defender and overtook several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then passed the ball to Sterling from the left.
The English striker, while in the penalty area, returned Aguero's ball in one touch, who drilled the right foot into the right corner of the goal by Matthew Ryan.
Aguero is having some leg problems, Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero got the ball, being deep in Brighton territory.
He gave a great pass on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before handing the transmission to Sterling on the long bar.
The Sky Blues' forward hit the ball right in the gate before he was scheduled to fly out of the field.
Manchester City will face off against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is going to take points from the Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to rush things.
But the tireless Scherzer is hoping to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division, start to struggle in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies are already in at least the 7th or 8th spot, but they're still hoping to secure a division title.
And while we're playing just like that, at least we can hold our ground, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver with the audience and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How could I miss this?
The Nationals haven't announced a pitcher for Sunday, but according to the latest reports, they're likely to put Scherzer in the role.
Scherzer, who is heading into Game 34, pitched Thursday in the outfield, and will be pitching Sunday, his day off.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republicans in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, the presidential nominee for the Supreme Court.
Everything we've done is being put on the map in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't run, although I do run, everywhere fighting for good candidates", he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we see the mean and the abominable.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, and that's what they want, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he argues, have set themselves the goal of "resisting and obstructing".
"And you've been watching this for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "evil, mean, ugly and lying".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused a loud outcry from the room.
Do you remember her answer?
You leaked the contents of this document?
What document?
No, no, body language gave her away, I've never seen body language so disprove words.
The Labour Party is no longer a dissident organization.
She doesn't tolerate those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion of no confidence in me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of the Labour MPs who have not yet been told that we are not welcome for speaking out.
I feel the same way about my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was a strong voice against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the vote of no confidence was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe - ironically, these are issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
A notice on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years that I was a local Labour MP, the Friday evening meetings of the GC were just like this.
Unfortunately, the tone today is not in line with many of those meetings, and the promise of "more humane and soft" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that there is no difference of opinion within the Labour Party is becoming increasingly apparent, and every opinion is evaluated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues whose political views I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions that I would never have agreed with, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Every time I leave the public forum - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a barrage of insults on social media calling for the election to be annulled, condemning the policies of the centre, or saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because comments made about me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a flood of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never back down.
What's most disappointing about this policy is that this amount of abuse has become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the "broad church", and with every vote of no confidence or change in the election rules, the party becomes already.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years, telling me to sit quietly and talk less, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, outraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally broke up my school class, I have sought to advocate for the highest standard of public service for those who need it most - whether it's a local MP or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, and I didn't do that in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is so hard-pressed to get to Brexit, which is guaranteed to bring economic, industrial and public losses, and I do not understand the willingness of some to waste their time and energy on questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only audience I really want to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of electoral annulment or political expediency will prevent me from acting in the way I consider necessary in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for the Nottingham East constituency
38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Er takes first place
Two late attempts may have slightly skewed the final outcome, but without a doubt, Er deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
They're now top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top 10.
In the end, it was all thanks to their excellent defense and their ability to pick the right moment, which gave the home team and coach Peter Merchi every right to be pleased.
"All this time we've been tested for strength and we're still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad", commented Peter Merchi.
Robin Christie, Melrose: Well, they did better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt by Fraser Climo led the Eagles to the lead, but a yellow card issued to Scottish Warriors player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to take the lead, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unsuccessful attempt.
Klimmo increased the gap from the penalty spot before, right in the middle of the game, he scored a point, and then in the break he made a one-off attempt, making the score 17-5 in favour of Er.
But the Melrose started the second half well, and a shot by Patrick Anderson, made by Baggott, cut the gap to five points.
There was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruiard Knot, who suffered a sprain, and after a re-entry, Er progressed further thanks to a try by Stafford McDowell, implemented by Climot.
Acting captain Blair MacPherson was given a yellow card, and again Melrose forced the opponents to pay by another player for Bruce Colvin's unsuccessful attempt, at the end of the period of furious pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind the incoming mole.
Climo took the lead, staying almost unchanged from the second outing, after Kyle Rowe took a hit from David Armstrong and sent out-goal tackle Gregor Henry on the fifth home run.
The star of Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant business .
Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to start working in the hotel industry: it's been revealed that he's been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he also writes the script, and stars alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's last, and it looks like Kearnan is planning a life after Craigslist.
Officially, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source with the Scottish Sun hinted that Kearnan was planning to take part in a "thriving restaurant business" in Glasgow.
Our Sea: landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are hoisted on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right".
It's our duty to bring him back.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century's bloody resource conflict is still alive, and the desire to sail the Pacific once again is alive.
These hopes may be the most bold in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court, which will take place on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a balance of mind and, of course, they are waiting for a positive result", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to back Bolivia's claim that after decades of tense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign sea-exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is fighting a tough battle to be re-elected next year, is also eagerly awaiting the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, it will make little difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to administer Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not influence the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision was issued only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated, says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, Bolivia's case has been stalled, rather than delayed.
"The current administration of Bolivia has exploited the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes", Zarate says.
According to her, Morales's bellicose rhetoric has destroyed the last of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to have discussions.
The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court's decision was made too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit", he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees with Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, using the naval issue as a political trump card.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he said.
The court's decision is an opportunity to reassure us that we need to step back from our past.
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go to the end of its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of their countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is gradually returning to the path of resuming stalemate nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri argues that the dream that prolonged sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is utopian.
Washington is wary of approving the declaration unless Pyongyang takes substantial steps to disarm first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Show is showing off its latest line of massive headwear that promises to be mass-marketed and worn right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, there's no need to look elsewhere.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a slew of unusual headwear, part of their SS19 collection, that dazzled visitors to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the extremely unhandy hats were gaining popularity on Instagram, and the designers decided to put their stunning creations on the podium.
The Valentino's distinguished example: a beige headgear decorated with wide feather-like fields, was embellished on the heads of the models.
Other massive accessories included precious-stone watermelons, a magician's hat, and even pineapple, but these headgear are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of fancy masks, which was a huge embarrassment on Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had mouth seams, and they were more like a portrait of Hannibal Lecter than a work of sewing.
One of the copies resembled a scuba gear with a tube and protective glasses, and the other was melted ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of making it into the mass market  right up your alley.
The huge hats are on the heels of La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat with fields that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
The iconic label that produced this extremely unpractical hat, which has gained such widespread popularity on social media, has spawned and sent walking around the podium another huge accessory  a straw beach bag, almost as large as the swimsuit-wearing model herself carrying the bag.
An orange burnt raffia bag with a white leather handle and raffia trim became a highlight of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will be mass-marketed next summer, and with the designer making such a big deal about his work, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories".
John Edward: Language is of great importance to the citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of excellence, which was reaffirmed in 2018 with outstanding exam results demonstrating individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other socially relevant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which has over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, and is committed to providing the highest level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career, and the status of world citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of individual school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are calling on his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you are reaching his heart.
This is a powerful example of how we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with citizens of other countries.
In the latest exam results this year, we see that languages are leading the league table and have the highest test scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade of А.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of pupils achieved A in Mandarin (a dialect of Chinese), while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved A.
This is proof that in independent schools in Scotland foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are now as much in demand as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that among the reasons employers had difficulty filling job vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly becoming a key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession a student chooses, learning a second language will have a real benefit in the future, since it will give him another additional skill that will be useful for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to sustain a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage  spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
That's why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowing more than one language, especially in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding good jobs.
There is a wide variation in the languages taught in schools in Scotland, with each school having its own set of languages.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in light of the country's future development until 2020  such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a choice of languages with a teaching staff that is specialised in those languages.
Independent schools in Scotland strive to create a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what future they face.
It is now undeniable that in the global business environment, languages are still vital to the future development of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for Scotland's youth.
It must be done well.
John Edwards, Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego .
The fans' impatient wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason Sunday game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be seen how much time he has left to play.
"More than one and less than forty-eight", Walton replied on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games in the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the season", the player replies.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a wave of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, including visits to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is looking to win support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is the Trump summit in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 p.m. eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at hearings this week on the nomination of his nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for the Supreme Court, which has been met with a backlash over accusations of sexual harassment, and a Senate vote that was supposed to be postponed for up to a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main purpose of this campaign is to help the Republicans who are running for office in November, to increase the electoral momentum.
So President Trump's campaign is focused on making these five meetings, which are set to take place next week, help to "activate volunteer and supporter activity" as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The event, scheduled for today at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump's visit to West Virginia this Saturday is his second visit to the state in a month, as he's gotten a 40 percent lead in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"The fact that Morrissey has to be president to start ahead of his opponents in the polls is a bad sign for Morrissey himself", says Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is showing its willingness to fight and hopes to go to the pair competition on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's two-on-two was perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transition initiative is an exceptional sporting concept, but it is what the players believe in, and it is particularly evident at competitions like this.
So who's got the initiative?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so I guess it's a little initiative for us", Jordan Spit said as he left.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead, and 12 more at stake.
Americans, Spit says, feel the wind in their sails, and they have reason to keep their spirits up, not least because of Spit and Justin Thomas' form, playing together all day, and each boasting three points out of four.
Sleep was more unyielding from grin to grin than he was as a personal example.
The victory cries grew louder as his round went on, sending the deciding ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas lost two-to-two.
His shot, which gave them the win in the game at the 15th hole, was met with a similar outcry, one that speaks to his belief in a chance for the American team.
"You have to concentrate on your game", Spit commented.
That's all the players have left now.
Go 18 holes and be the champion.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly in the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked out four of the four, and they don't seem to know their mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only couple who didn't get bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
This series and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the furious fans reinforces the belief that they will not be beaten on Sunday, and when the sun sets over the horizon of the Le Golf National, there will be no more famous player to secure a potential European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be great if we were both on different pits at the same time.
But it's too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggs and two double boggys on the first nine holes dug a Spanish and a Swedish hole, from which they could never climb out.
So on Sunday, no one's gonna help you get out of your hole.
It's so exciting to watch a four-ball, four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they're exchanging, and the deliberately overlooked advice, and how strategy can change in an instant.
So far Europe has been better as a team, and has made a significant leap forward on the final day, but this four-man session has also shown that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight that some, especially in America, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day
Europe will get a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two wins over wrestler Tiger Woods to bring the score in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, keen to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the mistaken American team in the morning's four-ball game, winning 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they were unable to close the gap in the score.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed by four balls, they then combined to beat the fallen spirit Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChebmo by an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic glimpses, but now he has lost 19 of 29 matches in four balls, and fours  seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the morning's four-ball game, returned to teammate Henrik Stenson in the fourth, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppke 2-1 and ranking first and third in the world.
For Europe, however, the game was not an easy and pleasant daytime stroll to the southwest of Paris.
The two points earned by three-time champions Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday were a benchmark for the Americans.
They won a decisive 2/1 victory over Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in the quarter-finals, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from four points behind, coming out on their own, given that Ferrick's team, as the hosts, needed to play a draw to retain the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it's beyond their reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions increase mistrust of the United States and that his country will not renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "substantial goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing not to build up nuclear weapons and develop nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing a symmetrical response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to unilaterally take the first steps toward disarmament".
While Ri repeated already-sounding North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in that it did not reject unilateral, unchecked denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent US president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; when Kim promised to start a move towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also has resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists that denuclearization should be done first, and is increasing pressure through sanctions to force its goal and even object to declaring the war over, Ri says.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream for people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the continuing sanctions are increasing our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in that took place over the past five months, adding: "If the side of this denuclearization issue was South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock".
However, Ri's tone was markedly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile launch on the US mainland was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was not setting a time frame for the process: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue actively and imperatively until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to block Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and announced after the meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for "bandit demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its missile complex as well as its nuclear complex if the United States, for its part, takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was talking about were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax on special courses
A new course introduced this year at Harvard University has helped all elementary school students learn to sleep more and fight the chauvinist culture of constant caffeine consumption to stay awake all night.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was inspired to introduce the course by giving a preliminary talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'I wish I had known about this until I was almost finished.'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered to students for the first time this year, explores how a healthy sleep routine can help you achieve academic and athletic success, as well as improve your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Health Service, says the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, and students complete a series of interactive tasks.
One of the sections of the classroom offers a room in the dormitory where students, by pressing on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books, receive information about how each of these activities and substances - coffee, light, which cause sleep deprivation - affect athletic performance, and about the importance of getting enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages students to reflect on their daily lives.
We understand that this class will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, as any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health", added Professor Chesler.
He said the false sense of pride in being able to "plow all night" is still quite common, and modern technology, as well as the increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
He says that getting enough good quality sleep is the student's "secret weapon" for dealing with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even for dealing with overweight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into a hunger mode, causing it to feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler design the course by attending one of the classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread the word across the campus.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to take a similar curriculum before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chessler recommends that students set alarm clocks to warn them of the time to go to bed and wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which disrupts the human biorhythm and leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mengo's goal brings victory to Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another disappointing away game as Dolly Meng's goal led Steven Gerrard's unseeded team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Iberrocks were hoping to pick up their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side only suffered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Hearts, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers, who had lost their spirit, didn't seem to be going to even the score.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston have moved up to third, only behind Hibernian in goals scored.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after linebacker Calum Spence had to heal a head wound after an object was thrown from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in the team that went through to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same strategy that Livi 11 used to increase the gap with Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased to see his well-mannered squad squeezing the opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have led the way in sword possession, but Livingston was squeezing a lot more when the ball hit them.
They were to score within two minutes of Mengele's first pass to Scott Pittman, when Alan McGregor stopped him, but the midfielder took advantage of the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs kicked a penalty against team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to send the ball to the far end.
The Rangers took control, but in the last quarter, it seemed like there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he should have kicked a penalty in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers made just two shots in the first half, but former Iberrocks goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassan Coulibaly's headshot, and the weak shot by Ovie Edgario.
Although Levy's first goal in the 34th minute may not have been a match-fix, no one can deny that they deserved it solely through their own efforts.
But again, the Rangers failed to match Jacobs' play from the standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying hard to pass the ball to Meng for the finish.
Gerrard started at halftime when he traded Coolibaly for Ryan Kent, and the substitution almost immediately paid off when the outfield midfielder passed the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to pull guests into their own game involving Lithgow and Halkett, making long-running shows.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the closing stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Lithgow passed from the corner.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he faced Jacobs, but Thompson again refused.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the foundations of science, the Geiger counter became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film The Corona Clock, with the cowboy-like Roy Rogers and the seemingly un-scientist-like Dale Evans in the lead roles:
Man: What is that thing?
This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can actually hear the impact of the atoms that are generated by radioactivity in the minerals.
You can hear it now.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days short of his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see abnormally growing cells and kill them.
Part of the vaccine's therapeutic effect is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
The method is to extract the patient 's immune cells and change them in the laboratory .
As a result of this change, the cells have the ability to see the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, and then the cells have to be re-entered.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who was given this vaccine, and whose immune system had learned to recognize abnormal cells, had had ovarian cancer in remission for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory, after which the modified cells can see the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many types of cancer, and then the modified cells are re-introduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, states: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
A similar technique has been successfully used in the treatment of leukemia, where the immune cells are taken from the patients and they are trained to act on the cancer cells.
Kanye West appeared in defense of Trump in a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It went badly.
Kanye West was whistled at in the studio during a Saturday concert where he spoke out in defense of US President Donald Trump, claiming he would take the job again in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", which he performed with the cap "Make America Great Again", the singer made a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
I talk to white people a lot, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump when he's a racist?"
Well, if I cared about racism, I'd have left America long ago, the performer said.
SNL did a parody show starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment claims.
No public outcry was shown on television, but the video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the public that his hat was being ridiculed backstage.
They made fun of me backstage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
The Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, "They also said my position wasn't strong".
West continues: "And you want to know what's not cool? To put on a Superman cloak so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to keep evolving?
Then you need love.
His comments caught the attention of audiences at least twice, with SNL cast members appearing puzzled, and one person telling the publication: "The whole studio went silent".
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle costume.
West was endorsed by TPUSA Conservative Group leader Candice Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING SO MUCH".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful.
However, I don't want to support anyone (by buying their music, clothes or otherwise supporting their creativity) who I believe shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
"Like we did", she said.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lion, and as another example, of course, you can bring in the newly legendary performer Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a restaurant in east Belfast suffered a fatal stabbing attack on a customer on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballihakamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the State Attorney's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington is attacking toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is best known for his role as sword-wielding John Snow in the HBO crime-thriller Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor recently lashed out at the macho stereotype, saying that such characters often instill in young people the idea that you have to be cruel to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something had gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, a woman of his own age, admitted that he was "very indifferent" to the problem.
"I personally take this question quite seriously: Where have we gone wrong with our perception of masculinity?" asks the actor.
Why are we teaching kids growing up that we have this problem today?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this surge in toxic masculinity due to overly muscular characters.
The actor goes on: "What is innate and what is acquired?"
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young men feel that they should only display one particular aspect of masculinity?
I think that's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because there's something really wrong with young people today.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ends next summer, stating that he was "done with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's reboot of True West, which tells the story of the film's producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
"I met my wife on this show, so it gave me my family and my life", says the actor.
Rose played the title character of Keith John Snow's passionate game-playing character in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection for these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaked information by Republican senators, complaining of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her staffers had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
A Los Angeles Democrat claims that the lawsuits were forged by far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more vile lies", Waters tweeted.
The leaked information reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of Southern California, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office, and released information about Waters' employees, Hill reports.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false", Waters assures.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete lie.
Waters's statement prompted online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This is a furious denial", writes Fleischer.
It means the author has a temperament unsuitable for Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why get angry?
And you don't have to apologize.
And you shouldn't dig into the motives of the prosecution.
We need to stay calm and cool.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If this is true, it is very important", he writes.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent activities.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found", she writes, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which could be destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my employees".
Johnny English strikes again with a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit in any new film that features Britain in one way or another; this is also true of the new parody spy franchise Agent Johnny English, which began production in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: Reboot.
Will it be a self-deprecating picture with the leitmotif "obviously we're all shit" as a new attempt at national export?
Anyway, the rubber-faced, blink-eyed profane Johnny English has gotten his right to chaos for the second time. It's his name that most vividly hints at the fact that he's a widescreen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a dumb-ass secret agent who, despite his fanciful claims to glamorous smudge, gets a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's features and a slice of this guy who puts one single note into the tune of Chariots of Fire in London at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
Originally, the character was based on the persona of a traveller and the enigmatic international Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the character leaves behind a complete chaos.
There's one or two good things about this latest issue of JE.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approaches the helicopter, wearing medieval armor, and blades are sliding down his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson's gift for performing comedic scenes physically, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely redundant, especially since such "serious" film reviews as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible" now confidently offer comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is for kids, not adults, and I find Johnny English's quirky mischief not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's jokes in the Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, exposing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the horror of the acting agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately has a small role here.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, a pompous and assertive figure who is already suffering from massive political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can for the quasi-Theresa-May character, but the script is not working.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she'll have to get someone out of retirement.
And here comes the awkward Johnny English himself as a real person, who is now a schoolteacher in some brothel, but also gives informal lessons in covert operative work: there are some good jokes here, because English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of Khrok.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency briefing and is reunited with his formerly unlucky buddy Buff, again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, subordinate to the submarine commander in the role of "cheerful hockey stick", in which Vicky Pepperdine gets a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because of a terrible mistake at Her Majesty's Secret Service, and they're faced with the beautiful, fatal woman Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems - the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of the Volta; English generates complete anarchy by trying to use the headset of virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volta house.
All these scenes, of course, are sweet and silly fiction, but there's something very childish about them.
It's a moderate amount of stuff.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was really in proportion to his talent?
Labour denies they are working on a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day wage
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan whereby British people will work four days a week but be paid in five.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give back the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution by giving them extra time off.
This would allow employees to enjoy three days off for the same wage.
Sources said the idea is "fitting" into the party's economic agenda and will help the country's population to side with the workers.
The trade union congress has approved a four-day workweek so workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is our goal, which is consistent with the party's approach to changing the balance in the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week back during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to articulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from the faceless directors and speculators of the utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current water company shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may make "deductions" based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private sector firms' capital to workers who would be able to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could prompt any Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I went to the hearing and said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the information came out, I said, "Did you do this?"
His answer was firm, definite and unequivocal.
But Graham's opinion remained unchanged at the vote.
"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments comparable in force to dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I do know for sure is that Brett has been adamantly denying it", Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the witnesses she called could confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't see anything new in her.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive star cast with an equally impressive mission: ending poverty worldwide.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of World Citizens is bringing tens of thousands of people to the vast Central Park lawn, not just to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but to share the true purpose of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of a global anti-poverty project run by an international human rights group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or do any other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the Peace Citizens Festival been in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people by free concert attendance really convincing citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" where people believe they are making real change by signing an online petition or posting messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen's organizers say that since 2011, the festival has registered more than 19 million actions by supporters who pursue a variety of goals.
It is worth mentioning that through these actions, world leaders have pledged more than 37 billion US dollars, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds have directly helped nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementers committed to helping children reach their full potential has pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens participants.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a thing of the past", said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition-enhancing activities.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the festival's website: Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
The Global Citizen organizers respond: It will be a long and difficult journey, where we will occasionally stumble and fall.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monet are some of the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy may use blockade to block Russian energy exports: Home Secretary
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said Washington could "recourse to its navy if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy the way they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe", he says.
And according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, together with our navy, has the ability to ensure the open sea lanes and, if necessary, blockade the energy from the market", says the minister.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that positions itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He then compares Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel", says the minister, referring to Russia as "one-trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made in connection with the Trump administration's goal to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream-2 project, which is expected to double the pipeline's existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, represented by the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"When a third country interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will be carefully considering running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, we need a woman at the top", says Warren The Hill.
After November 6th, I will be carefully considering running for president.
Warren said that President Donald Trump's actions during the hearing "lead this district in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course we need to have an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research, 58 percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the other hand, support her plans.
The poll showed that the population is more supportive of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his possible participation in the election, and 48 percent opposing.
Other prominent Democratic names that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he'll make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a meeting with voters of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, enlisted in the Army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"My son, who has returned home, is going through the same thing as other family members who are suffering from PTSD and who have been injured, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries", she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "blind spot" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back different, hardened, wondering if their comrades, soldiers, airmen and any other military personnel are being given the same respect they have for their country".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman by interfering with a violent and intoxicated gun incident, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, the District of Columbia, support the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that prohibits the granting of asylum to victims of domestic violence or flight.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and counties filed a court consultant's analytical memo in Washington on Friday in support of a challenging asylum seeker.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband and his sons, who are members of a criminal group, have mistreated her, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing large numbers of asylum applications in the United States as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle", the court counsel's report said.
Lawyers also argue that policies that ban immigrants from entering the United States are damaging to the economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens that is most likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
"Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
This tool was never meant to solve absolutely every problem, even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu: number of dead doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult.
"It's very difficult right now", says 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, the ambulance is bringing in the wounded.
Clean water is in great scarcity.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig through wet stuff and try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude quake are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwy Harris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, were resting near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors because they had to leave the premises due to the ongoing tremors.
He cries as he recalls how a powerful earthquake destroyed the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save.
I think I was crushed by the rubble, Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or our baby.
I hope they're safe and well now.
US Ambassador accuses China of "attacks" carried out through "propaganda advertising"
A week after one of China's official newspapers published a four-page ad in an American daily that talked about the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid-for supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, to accuse China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a confirmation of what US officials told Reuters: a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, resulting in them equalizing tariffs on their countries' imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to shock exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, argues that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Des Moines Register Sunday, is now doubling down on this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and a free press, which we hold dear, by paying for and placing ads in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstad.
"But in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you're unlikely to hear dissenting voices and see the true diversity of opinions that Chinese people might be exposed to when they learn about China's troubling economic policies, because the local media is under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He also added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had "sneakily" declined to publish his article, although he did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Republicans pushing women voters away with Kavanaugh's dissent ahead of the midterm elections
Many senior Republicans prefer to stay out and support Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite several allegations of sexual assault, with analysts warning that there is a backlash, especially from women, that could affect the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the situation have heated up to the extreme, and a majority of Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue the vote.
You can't go back to that stuff later, writes Grant Reyer, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Rieher doubts that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s attempts to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
Protesters chanted "November is ahead!" in front of the Senate on Friday morning as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of bounds", said non-party political scientist Stu Rotenberg on the news site.
People say it's already getting pretty bad, and it's true.
But things can get worse, especially for suburban female voters and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford publicly testified against a Supreme Court nominee, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts speculated that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could spark a backlash.
"It's already a mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench, but how Republicans handle it, how they feel about it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, tells the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to trust - Ford or Kavanaugh - and are slightly more inclined toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony exactly or likely, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh's testimony exactly or likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to gain "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he says of his startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own personal online data warehouses or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, cases, as well as a calendar, music library, and other personal and professional data tools.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify  all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal online data storage is that it is completely user-controlled, which allows access to any information you need.
The company calls this principle "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make radical changes that would completely change their entire business model overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet", says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Churchman awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Belengeles and Lœukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he had received Britain's highest military award.
The monument to the event was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Cantine Canal in very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later he threw himself into the line of fire and with "great courage" led the group forward, then with one hand threw a field gun, shooting down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, slightly more than a month before the end of the war.
The hero's 72-year-old grandson, Michael Vann, said he was unlikely to have done as heroically, but it was humbling.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath at the end of the parade, conducted by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said it was a great honor for him to participate in the parade and added that the "bravery of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be shown by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppa Pig.
Imagine you stayed up all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't get to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six main programme fights, the fights were broadcast all night live on Channel 5 television in the UK.
At 6am, as Geogard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the match, UK fans were stunned to see "Pink Pepper" on the screens.
Some fans were not impressed, as they stayed up late to watch the match.
One fan on Twitter called the change to a children's cartoon "a sick joke".
"There was a government ruling that this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m. so they had to switch to kids' programs", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked why this happened.
Yes, the Pig of Peppa.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they plan to schedule the matches in a way that will allow UK viewers to watch in the future.
"As for the re-shows, I think we can sort this out", says Coker.
But it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't decide that until Sunday, our time, and it's Monday to them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the show was changed, there was a lot of text messaging, and it was not friendly.
We tried to fix this problem right away, thinking it was some kind of technical glitch.
Turns out it wasn't, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you, next time, that's not gonna happen.
We're going to cut the number of fights to five instead of six as we normally do, and for the fans we're trying to increase that number, but we've gotten a little bit too much.
Yeah, that didn't work out.
Tom Daly felt a sense of inferiority because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not everyone is like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme, hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics became less of a concern for him after he had a baby.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daly, who was a featured guest on LaVern's show, said he felt "more inferior than anyone of his age" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, for both boys and girls.
He says, "Until today, these feelings of inferiority and inadequacy were very real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, he called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life without consequences, and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "had taken him by surprise".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
When so much is happening in your life at such a young age, he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find a peer who has had the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole worldview" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about winning the gold medal", says the athlete.
But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daly said his father didn't want to accept that he was dying, and one of his last requests was for front row tickets to the 2012 London Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him 'Dad,' you wouldn't be around, and you wouldn't be able to sit in the front row", says Daly.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize he wasn't invincible", says the athlete.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming of all my life", he says, "diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics was the best feeling I've ever had".
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song  Proud by Heather Small  which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still loves it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 English summer time. This is the first time I've ever heard of this.
Mickelson, who is in bad shape, has spent this Saturday on the bench for the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday with his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to tighten his form to avoid a disappointing milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for four balls and four fours.
Instead of being in the spotlight, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time major winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what was bothering him.
Having never had the most direct shot, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal candidate for the tough Le Golf National circuit, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccurate shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face British Open defending champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have lost four points in 12 singles matches, get off to a strong start, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though, what else could he say.
"He fully understood the role he was given today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Ferrick commented.
He's pretty confident about himself.
He's a walking Hall of Famer, and he's done so much for these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was what it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there, with everyone.
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Fold's record for most Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferrick said his presence has been of considerable benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to tease people, and he's a great guy to be interesting with", he explained.
I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to watch.
His game is much more than just a game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advantage may soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant lead in singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a draw.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderram, where the team led by Severjano Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line only slightly ahead by the smallest margin, winning by 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Walderram where we won, but only so far", Bjorn said, pictured here, after watching the Class of 2018 win at Le Golf National 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday, resulting in a 10-6 score.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that this is not the end.
You'll be out on the full moon tomorrow.
Go and do it right.
As long as the glasses aren't on the board, nothing's over.
We have a goal, and that's a chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I've been talking relentlessly, focusing on our 12 players, but we know so well what we're up against -- against the greatest players in the world.
Pleased with how his players performed on an uncomfortable golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have surpassed myself in this.
Tomorrow is another test.
Tomorrow is the one-on-one show, and that's a whole other story.
It's always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you experience all the power of a professional golfer.
That's the kind of thinking we need to instill in the players so they can get their act together tomorrow.
Now the partner is left behind, and he has to do his best too.
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will perform better individually than their partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferrick himself went through the whole last few days of the carousel, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before losing out when Europe held the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word about it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had his players together before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it off as quickly as Brooklyn or Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've made our game plan accordingly and we've set the guys up the way we thought was right, you know?
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance, facing Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the table.
"I picked exactly that group of guys, and in that order, because I think that's how they're going to cover all the possible flaws", Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
Germany 's new warship put into service again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen next year because of faulty systems and a spiraling cost increase, local media report.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg class, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reports, citing a military official.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful cannon, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some steels  technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer service periods  the ability to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant delay in commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in combat.
The software flaws were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors  only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to implement upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of keeping the newest frigates anchored are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was "de facto running out of ships capable of deployment".
The official said the problem was exacerbated over time because the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could ever be taken into service by the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study in a Scottish Highland farmhouse is trying to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the data will provide new insights into the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help with future conservation efforts.
The study, organised by the National Trust for Scotland, will study common toads, soprano toads, and the brown long-haired bat and Dobbanton night herons, which inhabit Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the area using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the cries, as well as the types of activities that the various groups of these animals are responsible for.
Then a habitat map is drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes that these results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify major areas of habitat management, such as meadow formation, and ways to maintain forest areas in optimal conditions for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can pose dangers, as can fly tape, chemical processing of building materials, and cat hunting.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to pinpoint obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat populations very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, field inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, it's a great place for bats", he says.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He reminds us of the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance on private property, as accidental destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, and it is illegal to destroy, harass or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund's chief executive officer, is calling on the public to help.
She says, "We have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of the individual species live".
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape, calling them "fake news" and claiming that people just "want to get rich" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published the accusations against the footballer.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga, which allegedly took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, the Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram video with 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were announced, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to do this.
What they've told us today is all fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They're just trying to get their own way by using my name.
That's all right.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's just part of their job.
I'm a happy man and I'm doing fine, adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable information about suspicions in the privacy area", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player intends to claim compensation for "moral damage" in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal fashion, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was 99% a good guy, but 1% a bad guy.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of being retaliated against" and "fear of public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was set to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will regret the car manufacturers lost forever
Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark has said that Britain will "regret it forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit.
He also commented on reports that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", says Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Bernaston plant produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll have production stopped at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is saying it will close its Mini factory in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to carmakers, the supply chain will be put at great risk if there is no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line is launched on time, and parts for custom-made cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be border disruptions that industry officials say could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stock at its Derbyshire plant for more than one day, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU, as articulated at Chequers, was "just calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
We want to make the best deal that will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success now, but to take advantage of that opportunity in the future", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are saying that we should be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains".
Toyota was unable to specify the timing of the shutdown, but warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tswalaris, who has worked at Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory's union, says that the concern of the union members is growing: "In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will never be able to get them back".
A government spokesman says: "We have developed a precise and robust plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed" to another week as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstructions to justice by the president.
Whether Trump would remove the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a matter of speculation in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wires to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House to allegedly resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, was speaking on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week in view of all the other events happening in the Supreme Court".
But look, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings is not due to "disdain for the community" of television reporters, though she added: "I won't deny that they are playing to the public".
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
"The president has held more meetings, answering questions from journalists than any other president before him", she added, without giving exact figures, though: "We have those numbers".
Sanders assured me that the briefings would continue, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this as often as we can, and you know how many meetings we've had over the last few weeks, and if you can talk to the president of the United States directly, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Press conferences are a rare occurrence.
The president's frivolous and sometimes strange behavior in front of a gathering of journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why this is so.
Health Minister addresses EU workers in Scotland with letter over concerns over Brexit
The Health Minister addressed EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express gratitude for the country's estate and wish them to remain in their jobs after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, wrote this letter to her staff less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of filing an EU status application for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "The UK and EU have been negotiating the withdrawal issue throughout the summer and the expected decision should be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very stressful time for all of you.
So right now I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery for a head injury .
Tennessee's Michael Organ said Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He went to the sideline and just collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on stretchers and taking him for a medical examination.
A Tennessee state spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details on the type/grade of injury" and that Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who had just entered his sophomore year, it was his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before he was out of the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which totaled 18 for the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Under Tory's new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless.
This move will nullify Corbyn 's efforts to attract young voters .
The increased stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will negate Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters, who have promised to make housing more affordable and raise incomes.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay UK tax, and the additional funds raised should stimulate the government's efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge on the existing stamp duty, including the increase introduced two years ago on secondary and rental housing, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to save up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are bought by non-British residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to improve their housing conditions afterwards.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who, after buying a home here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of inflating property prices by buying land but not actually using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to remedy Britain's "disgraceful housing situation".
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include controlling rents and ending unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local authorities more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I had dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with each new generation.
And that means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-British people, as well as for foreign companies, property is as affordable as it is for hard-working Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the threat of being on the street is too real for some.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the revival of the North-East club, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points clear of the top flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's it, Ross told Sportsound BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland as a child with my father in Hampden, and it always drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I can become a successful manager of the club.
Ross was preceded by former Sunderland managers Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he has not felt the same reverence for such high-profile names at such big clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
"The club is definitely in the Premier League", says the coach.
Getting him out there is a tough task, but I'll consider myself done if I can get the club back.
Ross has been in charge for just three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from the third tier and the following season led St Mirren from relegation to championship status.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalls of his responsible work at Alloa.
I honestly believed that management was better for me than play.
It sounds weird, because I was doing all right, making a lot of money in this job, and I had some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done every week.
I'm still under a lot of stress and pressure at work, but I feel good about being a manager.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, doing so, I feel most comfortable, like a fish in the water, in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 CET.
According to the poll, 5:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The summer heat led to increased sales in British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from the business consultancy CGA, who obtained the statistics, said: "The continued sunshine and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when pub sales rose by 2.8%, and restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly".
The June 1.8% decline in restaurant sales continued in July.
Pubs and bars that sell alcohol have far higher scores than restaurants.
Food-only pubs were also hit by the sun, though not as badly as restaurants.
It's like people want to jump out just to have a drink.
Beverage sales in pubs and bars rose 6.6% in the month, and food sales rose 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM's analyst in the leisure and hotel business, says: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the real estate market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful due to continued price pressure.
The long, hot summer has been a disaster for food operators, and it's not yet certain that August will bring much-needed rest with more moderate temperatures.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the closing of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors industry sales across the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 networks with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
According to the survey, one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students found a rise in fake Instagram pages
This news has raised concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" account that their parents knew about.
However, one in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts, a photo-sharing site.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic, clean account that their parents had access to, but there were also secret accounts.
One mother, accidentally gaining access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, stumbled upon a teenager who was urging others to "rape" him.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Headmasters' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them was usually secret.
HMC President Mike Buchanan says: "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and that is a worrying fact".
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of the Scottish athlete"
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilid Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics as an observer member of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics, with Chairman Ian Beatty arguing that the move is a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to take advantage of the athlete's extensive experience at the international level over the last decade.
"Ailide is held in high regard in the Scottish, British and international athletic community and we are confident that her participation will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland", says Beatty.
Doyle says, "I aim to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can really make a positive contribution to the development of sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator for the BBC, having suffered a stroke that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I've lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was a tiring job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am doing the agility exercises!
Thank you so much for your support!
A milk-sucking ad comparing nursing mothers to cows has divided Internet users
A company that produces milk suckers has caused controversy on the Internet by posting an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to milked cows.
Launching what is said to be the world's first breast-feeding silent vacuum cleaner, consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video to showcase the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner gives nursing mothers.
Four real moms dancing in a haystack to a song that says, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wart, it's my breast".
And then the chorus: "We suck, suck, we breastfeed our babies, suck, suck".
The video, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within a few days of birth.
Elvie sucks milk and dresses directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: It's understandable that it's equally traumatic for mothers and babies.
But yes, why not use them to advertise suckers for mothers who leave their babies alone?"
Another user adds:  Advertising detached from reality.
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just great".
I think that's a great idea.
If I was breastfeeding a baby, I'd definitely buy one of these.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
The commercials are a little crazy, but that's what it feels like.
"Genius product", wrote one user.
And another comment: A fun ad for breastfeeding mothers (often in their workplaces or toilets) who do feel a little bit like cows.
This ad is not about praising or criticizing our dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with these invisible suckers hidden under their bras.
The concept of this ad campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie sucker is completely imperceptible, has no wires or tubes, fits freely into the breast-feeding bra, and is invisible, allowing women to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and early child development specialist at Mother, comments: "The Elvie sucker is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative advertising.
By drawing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring the focus to breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a humorous and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker gives.
This isn't the first time that milk-sucking Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway of designer Martha Yakubowski, using the product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children have moved to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children with guardians.
Usually, most sponsors are the same undocumented immigrants themselves, and are afraid to risk their stay in the country by taking custody of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential survivors and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
About 80 percent of the persons who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant portion of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That's why we're continuing to pursue these individuals, "Albens said.
According to the shelter's staff, in an effort to speed up the process of filing the children, officials have introduced new rules that some of them must appear before the court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days as was the case before.
To declare their legal status to the immigration judge, many of them are present via video, not in person.
Those deemed ineligible will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information that has surfaced in the system in recent months, the longer children are incarcerated, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape.
Lawyers say these problems are compounded in larger institutions like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that sending children to tent camps without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw their troops immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualim also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country is now in its eighth year of war.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the crowd.
Muallem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011, the war on terror is almost over.
He said that Damascus will continue to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Muallem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encouraged refugees to stay outside the country.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of the civilians", he says.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military actions would be directed against jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee, comprising representatives of the government and opposition, will be convened soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mu'alem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency, which is probably what many liberal viewers hope.
And this will be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidency in history!
At this point, there's no sign of any tiredness.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show topped cable ratings, with 3.5 million viewers on the screens in the evenings during prime-time newscasts.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's outside our grasp", says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama "The Appointed Survivor", about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, long-published comedy writer and author of Just Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Breaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, offers another theory.
She recalls riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Yes, because he's funny!"
There's something valuable about all this chaos. It's fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content on television, the story lines of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
OFF is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth straight hour a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of deep-soil for his book Fear, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, or Stormy Daniels's stark description of, say, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it's already beyond the reach of the informed.
I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of his job is to make us feel like a reality show is feeding you something every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily twists and turns of the plot (the fight with the NFL, the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleas this week, it was 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn't get off the screen, at least not when they're showing Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee and deciding the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss says.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Outsider money is pouring into the most brutal midterm elections the White House has ever run.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is getting a cash flow from a congressional redistricting in which two officials are running for the same seat.
This suburban Pittsburgh neighborhood, whose geography has been recently changed, is backed by Democrat Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a different district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which essentially intersects with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally assigned to Republicans as a result of electoral fraud.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate over campaign financing between the main party's financial forces  the Democratic Campaign Committee of the Congress (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became well-known in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district, with a 20-point lead.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which provoked a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varello, whose property was also in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to not recognize Taiwan, Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including cutbacks in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Amid regular internal meetings, North and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that was to be held to summarize a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, and effectively stopped considering the question of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the conference as a sign that the administration is really taking the meeting seriously.
Three American diplomats returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without taking any new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was reported by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst within the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next step may be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which there is now very substantial evidence of in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia and its attacks during the last election.
If Congress changes hosts, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in that body, just as he is preparing to address the electorate again, and possibly eventually a jury of his peers.
But there are many risks; I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, as is the downfall of his European counterparts.
We're all going to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
But we did not, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history unfolds at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president's activities and discussed his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times' data is incorrect.
How do we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or truthful, or if he is confirmed as chief justice despite credible sexual harassment charges and false testimony?
And first of all, in the medium term, will we vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe we can pass them with dignity, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy house where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she accompanied me to light the candles on the Sabbath on the swastika table.
With such a family background, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the clash with the Vienna Rapids.
Rangers are hosting Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season, a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard to achieve bigger results.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game thinking we could get something, and we left with nothing.
Maybe we could have done it in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we showed better.
There's another big European night this Thursday.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough one, given all the things that come with my injuries and the substitutions at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The lineup is very good, and the guys are really enjoying it; the training was on the Wurz.
Hopefully we can move on, put the past behind us and make it work.
Women lose sleep because of fear for their pension savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few of them told their family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide survey said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
However, only 10 percent said they had spoken about it with their children.
People want, they've had someone in their family take care of them, but they don't try to discuss it with them, says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
And that's where you start.
If you do not make your wishes known, you cannot prepare your family for the care you may have to take.
Discuss with your counsellor and your family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Consult your financial adviser to help you plan your expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed cash life insurance policy, which will help you cover these costs or you can insure yourself with your own property if you have the money.
Put your legal documents in order: save yourself from legal battles.
Make a healthcare power of attorney and appoint a trusted person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that your wishes are met if you cannot communicate.
We also recommend that you consider the possibility of drawing up a financial power of attorney.
You should choose a trustee who will help you make financial decisions and monitor your bills in case you become incapacitated.
Do not forget the little things too: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you provide information on the medicines he is taking and the allergies he has?
Write down all the details on paper so that you can prepare for any eventuality.
Martin adds: "It's not just the finances that matter, but the choice of doctors".
What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Make and write this plan.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the failure of communications, rescuers are unable to get any information from Donggala, a district north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu as a result of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggala, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palau  the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people (data for 2017).
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a district stretching along 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative district smaller than a province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstay of the economy of Central Sulawesi, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important to the province's economy, but is mostly concentrated in Morava, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, over the past 100 years, several tsunamis have devastated Palu and Donggala.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami to hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in ruins.
Sarah Palin 's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence situation, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention center and will be released on $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his "unique innocence".
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting an alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin came under criticism from veterans groups in 2016 after she explained her son's abusive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, allegedly acquired as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the casualties are expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos of the incident are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want to hand down a rare death sentence to a suspect in the New York City bombing .
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of carrying out the New York City terror attack that killed eight people  a rare federal punishment for a crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges are likely to result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury read Saipov a 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of racketeering-related murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of assault and vehicle destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was "carefully planned and deliberate", and Saipov carried it out in what is described as "a repulsive, cruel and criminal manner".
"Saifullo Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Andjelini, Nicholas Clevés, Ann-Laura Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuko", the announcement said.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since a Southern District of New York prosecutor sought the death penalty for a felony.
In September 2009, the defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.
The last time a federal death penalty case in New York was applied was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack he committed.
According to police, he told investigators he was glad he did it.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag hoisted in his hospital ward, police said.
He's pleading not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who is supporting Saifov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the sting" of Eurosceptics, as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have already "left" if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
However, the problem Mrs May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that Tory party members who oppose leaving the EU are joining a separate anti-Brexit protest taking place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, announced in Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insist that she continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Boone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wants to "take on the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be levelled and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to be in favour of Brexit, but we need to beat the Chequers".
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We didn't fight in the world wars to be dependent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Boone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving reporters this comment: "I say Prime Minister, just listen to the people".
Checkers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is unpopular with our party members and our activists who are actually storming the streets and voting for us first.
Please put Checkers aside and start listening to what you're being told.
In her harsh address to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers stay in their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum, then they need to be made to feel the heat.
"It's now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he says.
They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them: We will not let you get away with it.
Addressing the thrilled crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, to feel the sting.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit marched through Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved Tory anti-Brexit posters over the weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticised the Conservatives for the security issues in their party's mobile app.
"And these people claim that they can customize Canada plus plus IT systems and technologies, for border work, for borderless free trade with Ireland", he added.
It's a farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle, he argues.
Warren plans to study the presidential race thoroughly .
U.S. Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will "carefully consider the possibility of running for president".
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Deal, who was a co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's talk that she has a shot at running for President in 2020.
She held another meeting with voters in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon; it was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town hall meeting since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that's what we need to do, is to have a woman at the top.
As a result of the murder of Sims (trapped), an LSU player was arrested.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been arrested.
At 11:00 AM local time, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at a press conference.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the man they caught on video.
20-year-old Sims was shot outside the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that killed him", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a weapon and shooting Wade Sims in the head.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 6-foot-3-inch, Baton Rouge native played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after team tactics won him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, beating Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team tactics would play a big role in the race.
Already in the half-position, Bottas started well and almost hung on Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns, and invited Fettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stop first, leaving Hamilton to tail the entire group - a choice that proved decisive.
Mercedes went to a pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, stormed ahead, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free, risking to get stuck after a double-motion for protection in the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first lap.
He then led most of the race, holding onto his native tyres, with the aim of quickly finishing, pushing Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He ended up pit stopping on lap 44, but could not increase his pace on the remaining eight laps as Rykkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job this weekend and he was truly noble to share it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in reserve", said Hamilton.
Translating Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday voter rally for her claim that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that those involved in these events were "wicked, vile and lying people".
"The only possible reaction to all this, and what's been going on in the last few days in the Senate is beautiful, is anger, resentment, disgust and lies", he said.
You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you hear the information?
Remember her answer... you read the information in the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't.
All right, stop it.
"Did we, did we not?" he added, with a senator's tone.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges Ford had brought against Kavanaugh, and in early September, it was illegally released, but Feinstein denies the leak occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, but I didn't leak her information", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.
However, the way she denied the leaked information did not seem to please the president, who commented during a Saturday rally: "Here's what I'll tell you: Her body language failed her greatly.
She may not have been talking, but her body language was the worst I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend his nominee for the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats are using the charges for their own ends.
They're definitely trying to regain power by any means possible.
We see the mean, the abomination, they don't care who they offend, who they have to cross over to get power and control.
British elite hockey league: Dundee Stars 5-3 and Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid off Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants, winning the replay on Saturday with a 5-3 victory for the Dundee.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer led the Giants to the top.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
For Adam Keefe's men, the 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night was their third defeat of the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after a goal pass by Kendall McFall with the support of David Rutherford, after which Beaulieu doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the opening period, Sullivan returned the hosts to play at 13:10 before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney to tie the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first half when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar again equalized the score, scoring with a numerical advantage of 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee his first match-winning lead at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory, keeping rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are heading to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board could escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he knowingly risked his life to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing in the powerful earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to devastate the area, leaving many residents of Palu under the rubble.
Despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Guanawan Agung refused to leave his post in the terribly rocking control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu City.
He remained in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then, when he thought the tower was going to collapse, he jumped off.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air navigation official Johannes Sirit said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Baliqpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter landed in Palu.
"We are very sorry for this loss", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as access to Donggala, Shigi and Butong is limited, according to the disaster relief agency.
"The number of victims is likely to increase as a large number of people are still under the rubble and many have not been able to get out", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
Waves as high as six meters (6.6 feet) have devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: "Ambulance is bringing in people every minute.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, saying in particular: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now reports one person missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking plane.
Air Niugini's report said that as of Saturday afternoon, it has no information on any male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline also said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane started to enter the runway too low.
"And that's very good", adds Jans.
Janes said he and the other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane because the water level was up to the waist.
He also said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming on board, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing a nearby pier also helped with the rescue, using an inflatable boat that they used to get people ashore before the plane sank to about 100 feet (30 meters) below the water.
Flight Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in air crashes involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of these crashes were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst has proven the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a lawsuit against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone recordings to piece together the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones, which showed Tellis spending time with Chambers that night, contrary to his previous testimony, according to The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but his cell phone was found near Chambers; when this was discovered, police questioned Sanford.
In his deposition, Sanford stated that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tallis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, the phone records show that they only called for one week.
Rowlett also revealed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", says Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip hop"?
The hip-hop trio is going to fight the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive content.
Bristol-based band The High Breed argue that the content of hip-hop has changed, moving away from the original political and social issues.
The band members want to return to their roots and make "conscious" hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sued a married couple over a racist text.
A New York nanny sued a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny was "just another black woman" that she mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The couple denies being racist, claiming the lawsuit was filed for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the child care service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family for her first day of work in 2016.
"No, not just that, another black", Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly texted Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her mistake, the confused Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be African-American, was doing a bad job, and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, the New York Post reports.
Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then he was sent home on an Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple for $350 a day for six months under the terms of an initial verbal agreement, which was not, however, enshrined in any contract.
"I want them to understand that this kind of thing is unacceptable", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "And I know it's discrimination".
The couple disagree with the accusation of racism, and claim that firing Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, since by hurting her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
My wife sent her a message that she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, " her husband, Joe Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were rude without your intention?
Would you trust your newborn?
Come on, you guys.
Calling the lawsuit "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
And you're willing to go after a man who's in that position?
"Not very nice of you", added the investment banker.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already issued its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would misunderstand the bear's speech, a new letter says.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads a work for the first time, even before it's published.
It's funny to know that Paddington is a huge success.
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the teddy bear, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, and would have been optimistic about the refusal to publish, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was "both joyful and bitter" as the author died last year.
As for Paddington's own bear, she comments that he is "a very important member of our family" and that her father was quietly proud that his character had finally become famous.
"He was a quiet and modest man", his daughter said.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success: he was proud of it, although he didn't really consider it his own merit.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the product of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After boarding the plane, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said that things were really bad, that something had gone wrong", says Mrs. Ednan-Lapérouza.
Then he called again and said she'd be dead in the next two minutes, and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We're going to be together.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart working were gradually losing their effect as they left her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I should have just sat and waited, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by other people, other families.
I had to hold myself tight.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapérouza, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, coming to terms with the enormous loss she had just experienced.
"No one around knew what happened", she says.
My head was all over the place, I couldn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support so badly.
I know how much he loved her.
Women who have lost loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking that step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are placing cards on the Welsh Bridge with words of comfort and phone numbers where people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to experience what I experience every day", she says.
A 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a great cook and had a very charming smile.
Everybody loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, the room was lit up.
But before he died, he quit his job because he was going through a really bad time.
It was 2014, and Tyler was found by his brother, who was 11 at the time, who had committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm afraid of a chain reaction.
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know there's someone to go to and tell you everything, even if it's your friend.
You can't just sit there and shut up. You have to talk to people.
Mrs. Humphries, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed or upset or anything like that", she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
Christmas was the time he got particularly sick: he didn't even look at the children when they opened their presents.
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it, it's a shock to our family.
It tore her to pieces.
But we must live and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh 's future hangs in the balance , the FBI is investigating .
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for, an investigation limited in time and scope, we could bring in a little bit of unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "breaking down" amid a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason they're wobbling.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6, and if, as expected, things go badly for the Republicans, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to be the nation's chief justice.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh, who once worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases their report?
The vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equal votes and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has decreased under Kim.
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung Seug, citing data from the southern ministry, said that compared to the 2706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, last year the number had dropped to 1,127.
Mr. Park says key factors have been tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates charged by smugglers taking people out.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subject them to forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they reached a general agreement on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of impeding progress on the issue with its sanctions.
"If we don't have the slightest confidence in the United States, we won't have the confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we can't unilaterally start disarmament", Mr. Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kawano was quite emotional, sometimes even screaming and choking, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and well-planned assassination of an active person" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because of his bias against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself by his statements, and by the way he's lashing out at the Clintons and the Democrats", she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt was proven and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll tell you what, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only fit for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is seen as representing conservative justice.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh was left out of the decision whether to overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time to put a hysterical and prejudiced man in the Supreme Court and say, 'How wonderful!'", Pelosi said.
And women should own it.
It's righteous wrath, months and years of rage, she can't go through it without tears.
"When we are angry, we cry", Miss Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that unusual, do you?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who worked in a management position somewhere, and she told me that she cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she used to explain to her interviewer, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm actually mad".
And then she just kept talking.
I'm really impressed with that approach.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in a male-dominated office is one day I was crying in a rage, but I was grabbed by an elderly woman, a heartless manager, who I had always been terrified of, and dragged to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think they finally got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some minor affair and dropped out of the race, and Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to stop her from running for president.
It was a poorly thought out decision, she confessed to me with a smile 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was coming to an end, she was falling behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed like a complete loss.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only $250.
"Am I a valued commodity to them?" she wondered.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not run for office, she was so overwhelmed with emotion  gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she choked.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalls of the press reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what are they going to write on my memorial?
She cried all the time?
How a trade war with America could be good for Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the split between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when the new tariffs affected $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has hit back every time, most recently imposing tariffs on $60 billion of American goods at a rate of five to 10 percent.
China has promised that retaliation against the US will be equal every time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to experience even the slightest hardship any time soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means yielding to demands, but publicly yielding to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the U.S. trade war pressure could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rash policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that lead to an economic impasse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", says Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, specializing in Asia.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for its help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country will not accept aid under any conditions or aid from countries that sponsor terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team with a final score of 16.5  10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup hasn't been won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long jump on the par-3 16th hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the first player ever to go 5-0-0 since the current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player in the European team, Turbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have been the last Ryder Cup contender.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament for all of Europe's history with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help", says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match.
"I feel incredibly proud of this win, I grew up watching Tiger Woods play", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3.
That's a pretty strange figure for one of the greatest players of all time, who's won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend, trying in vain to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We managed to shake Europe a little this morning.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played brilliantly.
We're re-grouping, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move forward, and we're gonna make it happen.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta know how to lose.
We lost.
Red tide: news Microorganisms have decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects a general decline in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties are reporting abundant flowering, indicating a decrease in microorganism concentrations.
The Red Tide stretches approximately 130 miles of shoreline from northern Pinell to southern Lee County.
The foci can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but their numbers have dropped significantly since last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
We've had average concentrations in Pinellas County and nearby areas in the last week, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough County coastal area, high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota counties and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations in Lee County coastal areas, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties are still experiencing a chance of respiratory distress.
Northwest Florida was not reported to have this possibility last week.
