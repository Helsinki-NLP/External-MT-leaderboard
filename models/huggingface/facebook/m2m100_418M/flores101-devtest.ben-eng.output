The real population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
With the flow of the future, the new populations begin to be adapted to their new environment as soon as they begin to decrease with their other populations.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species anymore.
We call this process specialization, which generally means the formation of new species.Specialization is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.

In the 16th century, the Wagon Road was built in England.
Although the roadways are just a set of parallel wooden thresholds, they help the horses that are pulling a bit more fast and more comprehensible than the unrighteous roads of the day.
The crosses were introduced quite in advance to keep the tracks in the right place. However, slowly it is realized that the tracks will be more efficient if there is a steep of iron on them.
It became a common habit, but the iron was sitting on the wooden wheel of the car.
The iron wheel was finally replaced by wooden wheels, and the iron rail was first opened in 1767.
The first transportation system was walking on foot. humans began walking on foot a million years ago since humans of the Homo erectus species were able to stand completely straight on both legs.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecs, were not used to walking straight naturally.
4.2-3.9 million years ago, the astralopithecus fossils discovered the characteristics of the binocular species, although it is estimated that the Sahelantropus began to walk on two feet seven million years ago.
We can mix more friendly with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, even we can work as environmental workers, so that the futures will be reduced to some extent.
However, if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and disable it.

Step-by-step swelling, which is not just a reaction to external step-by-step signals, has been recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungus, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks contain their own long-lasting oscillators that will last for periods such as driving even untouched bicycles without external balls.
One of the primary evidence that the DNA is one of its genetic components was the test of Harshy and Chase.
Hershe and Chase used phases or viruses to place their own DNA in a bacteria.
They conducted two studies by identifying the stage’s DNA through a radio phosphorus or the stage’s protein through a radio sulphorus.
The cause of genetic changes can have different types of effects, but the subject of this effect depends on what kind of genetic changes will be, the importance of genetic objects being damaged and the damaged cells are germ-line cells.
Only the mutations that occur in the germ-line cells can be conducted in the baby, elsewhere the mutations can cause cell death or cancer.

In this dynamic shuttle transportation system, everyone is connected and supported in some way to a transportation system based on a private vehicle.
Science now indicates that this enormous carbon-based economy has driven the biosphere from its stable state that has been suitable for human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone lives in society and takes assistance from the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear such complaints about water quality or bridge breakdown.
Why the transport system raises these national complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? are the transport engineers just incompetent? or are some more fundamental issues ongoing?
The course between two drivers and their vehicles is called traffic flow.
Unfortunately, the mobility of the vehicle is difficult to guess because the motorcycle of the drivers is hundred percent sure never understood.
Fortunately, drivers have a trend of movement within a specific sequential range and thus the transportation system can also be mathematically presented in a fairly reasonable range.
To better present the traffic flow, the relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, design and managing road opportunities.

People have been familiar with various basic chemical substances, such as gold, silver, rubber since ancient times, because they are found from nature in an acrylic form and the main ingredient of ancient tools is equivalent to this mineral.
Aristotle, a philosopher, gave this theory, all of which consists of a combination of one or more of four elements: soil, water, wind, and fire.
It is like the four conditions of the substance (in the same sequence): hard, fluid, aerobic, and plasma, although according to its theory they are transformed into new methods to form what we see.
Screw metals are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are a lot of materials in the table.

It provides us with a lot of information and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI's science has a strong intention in literature, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that works on any machine's behavior, learning and intelligence adaptation.
AI’s research involves creating machines that can automatize the tasks that need intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and schedule, the ability of the customer to answer requests and questions, as well as the ability to recognize handwriting, voice and appearance.
These kinds of things have become separate regulations that focus on solving real-life problems.
