Spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Athlete Jonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the capital of Colombia, on Thursday.
Armed with a wingsuit, he flew at 100 miles [160 km] an hour over the famous sanctuary of Monserrate, at an altitude of over 3,000 meters, where many onlookers had gathered to watch his feat.
A black box in your car?
While road planners in the United States are struggling to find the money to repair dilapidated highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that is attached to the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record every mile driven by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and government offices to revamp the outdated system of funding major U.S. highways.
The generally uninteresting sector of highway planning has suddenly provoked a lively debate and heated alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly the road you drive, and then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about privacy protection.
And while members of Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states haven't waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay based on the number of miles driven.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS tracking system, on a test drive.
This is truly essential for our nation.
 It's not like we have a choice, said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which expects the state to start recording the miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially strapped.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can go more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a cent when gasoline prices are high.
 The gas tax is simply not sustainable, said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracking devices on 500 cars to test a mileage payment system.
 This is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long term, he said.
Wonks calls it a mileage charge.
The idea is not surprisingly appealing to city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market advocates at the Reason Foundation also welcome the idea of charging drivers per mile.
 This is not just a tax going into a big black hole, said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go down the pay-per-mile path.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House floor killed the proposal, responding to concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who must travel many miles each day to get to work or to town.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are making progress.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the nation's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon be paying the state mileage instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is conducting a test run on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently fitted their cars with a tracking device, drivers were concerned that the government might be tracking their every move.
 Worries about Big Brother and stuff like that are a big problem, said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website:  It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices. 
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that is now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car has driven, but not the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The company was not originally intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It was looking to break into the emerging market of car insurance, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she is testing have been popular with highway planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically uploaded by modem.
 People will be more likely to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them, said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been serious errors in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive and far less intrusive methods of doing this.
In Oregon, planners are trying the experiment by offering drivers a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a flat rate based on the average number of miles driven by all residents in the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxing system that would also be equipped to pay for parking, provide insurance  pay-to-drive  and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
 Drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them, said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate about paying per mile is simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply handle the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
A one-off or annual additional tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol, so that everyone pays his fair share.
 There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin, said Randy Rentschler, the committee's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of motorists will have to worry about their privacy and a bunch of other things.
David Bowie: four new songs to listen to
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, which was released in January, he has devised a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already surfaced on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album had left everyone stunned.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After a decade of silence (the last album, Reality, was released in 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to make the pop scene sparkle.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke planned to re-release the album on November 4.
He's prepared a feast for his fans.
The reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be released as a three-disc set: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four music videos already released.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks from the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe Edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie has actually made a video presentation of this beautiful box.
He introduces not only each of the records, but also the accessories that came with them: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, most importantly, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a skillfully mastered rock electricity.
The first ever
But Atomica isn't the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available online.
The Informer is a double-sided, eerie intro before a light ride that gradually slows to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems to be in his element when he's not on the ground anymore.
Space Oddity, on the other hand, was a lot worse.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: could he be from another planet?
The guitar riffs, the bewitching, make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie is having fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man on a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, playing on different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photo of the Louis Vuitton campaign, Invitation to Travel, of which he is the new face.
He will be featured in one of their commercials, which will air starting November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not being released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson said that before their release, the soldiers were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
He said all wounded soldiers were receiving appropriate treatment for their return to civilian life and none were released until they were ready.
Critics accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not meet the army's "universal service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a range of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the Army despite his request to stay on for one more year so that he could receive a fully indexed pension.
His case comes after Corporal Glen Kirkland testified before a parliamentary committee last month that he was pushed out before he was ready because he didn't meet the universal service rule.
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier can be prepared to leave with plans and consultations, but that this is totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready", he told The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine how much leeway it can give wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are unfit for combat.
Under current rules, seriously wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment overseas, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year show that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service age required to receive retirement benefits.
Liberal Veterans Affairs spokesman Jim Karygiannis called on Wednesday for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Disney is going to launch an animated series on tablets
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to give preference to tablets over its own television channels for the forthcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available starting November 24th on watchdisneyjunior.com or through its mobile and tablet app.
The worldwide launch on Disney Group channels is not planned until 2014, the statement from its Disney Junior division details.
The cartoon, aimed at children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of Callie, a cat who is the sheriff of a town in the American West where she keeps order with a magic lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for kids today", said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, as quoted in the release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming increasingly important", he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of those under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is willing to  cooperate  with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for the US intelligence services, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has asylum rights, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said:  Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat differences of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with charges against which it is impossible to defend itself. 
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that international support could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
As part of the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online:  If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will make it possible. 
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness  without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the US, it was worth taking.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that according to the lawyer for the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he should be assured that he would be in safety there, the MEP said.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a campaign of persecution  serious and sustained  which had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the worldwide reaction to  my act of political expression .
Citizens around the world and senior officials  including in the United States  felt that the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was in the public interest.
The letter offers cooperation with the German authorities  once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved .
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well be able to access apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the on-demand video service Netflix via their TV in the not-so-distant future.
Cogeco's subsidiary said on Thursday that it was conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces and more options", explained Cogeco's President and CEO, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, although the Cogeco subsidiary has not yet set a specific date for this new platform.
"You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail", Audet stressed.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers currently do not have access to.
Telecom giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be worked out.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable companies to make its service available through their broadcast platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Speech from the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite providers to offer customers the option of paying for card services.
"For about two and a half years we have been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large packages of chains is not working", said Audet.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"These discussions will have to produce a new kind of framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy on television", said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is down from net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company attributes this decline to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired US-based cable distributor Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for EUR 1.36 billion.
This was the company's first major acquisition after the failed one in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they increased by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
The Commission has already decided to grant a loan of ECU 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
Net profit for its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up to 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating like that.
I do not think this is a sign of a change in trend, he said.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very intense competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef products sold by two small British retailers, the Food Safety Authority said today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, which were manufactured in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained between 1 and 5 per cent horse DNA.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been in the product", the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year following tests in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that were supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles left four injured early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudière.
Just before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the opposite direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal by 6:00 on Friday.
Frontier Airlines is considering charging for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines is planning to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it said passengers could take the unopened can with them when they land.
The new carry-on baggage charge applies to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 bill was meant to encourage travelers to pay the fare in advance.
 We don't want to charge this price, she explained.
Airlines started charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could into the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
These charges are a way of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
This is to make Frontier's most loyal customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queuing at a Border boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure passengers know about these charges before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's hand luggage charges won't be enforced until the summer, though no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They consider that the costs of handling baggage are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them did not have to pay for luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first applied hand luggage charges three years ago, and low-cost carrier Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline that charges such fees is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra fees.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit's hand luggage costs brought in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers learned of the company's unusual hand luggage charges.
 I have never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career , he said.
I expected to see a gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added,  the passengers boarded at lightning speed .
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who drink soda or fruit juice can take the can with them unopened, and those who drink coffee can be served again free of charge.
She'll always give out free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 but withdrew seven months later after passengers complained and when no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's decision to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to entice customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it started offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the mileage premium by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business is in decline and she's losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity declined almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to fix Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA blames an internal error, not hackers, for the crash of its website.
The shadow National Security Agency said Friday that it was a bug that caused its public website to go down for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
 NSA.gov was inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , the intelligence agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA website had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can't access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not compromised at all.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA website crash by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly top secret NSA, once dubbed the  No Such Agency , has come under intense scrutiny and criticism in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive domestic and foreign communications surveillance programs  that are part of the NSA's classified files stolen from the agency and leaked by disillusioned former NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to much speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Downtown Delta now closed
The Delta Hotel Centre-Ville closed its doors Thursday in Montreal after 36 years of operation.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who are going to turn it into student housing.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, we met with employees individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months", explains Félix Bisson, regional director of labour relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of Delta comes in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there was tens of millions of dollars of investment while the competition is very fierce, there are a lot of new hotels that have popped up in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that is what happened", says Paul Arsenault, chair of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will be converted into a retirement home.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be built within two years.
Titan CEO says the Goodyear Amiens acquisition plan starts with zero employees
After throwing in the towel with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear Amiens-Nord site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American tire manufacturer Titan, today said he was ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 at the plant.
Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for productive recovery, had already announced this on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, you're back today.
You have made violent attacks and insults, speaking of 'so-called workers' who 'work three hours a day', of 'crazy' unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn of events.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg ?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest-paying industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone by what I said, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours is a handicap for France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudice against France.
What I see is a factory that makes good farm tires, has good equipment, is well located and has room to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so badly?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and skilled workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's say Titan buys the closed plant from Goodyear.
Titan could then move the machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
He wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from among Goodyear's current roughly 1,200 employees.
So Mr Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to reach an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were prepared to guarantee those 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he'd like a four-year warranty.
But as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all the employees agree, the plan to buy the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we guarantee a long-term job when there are no more employees left on site?
If Mr Montebourg can get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan to buy the plant, we do intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit declined as aircraft deliveries and orders declined
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by a drop in third-quarter aircraft orders and deliveries and contract problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not provided flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule for commercial service before September.
After the first test flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not as expected and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, downgraded his rating on Thursday from  overperformance  to  sector performance  due to the low potential for the stock market to rise in the next quarter or two quarters.
 Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the profit margin in the Transportation division, said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We expect Bombardier to record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
But firm orders for the CSeries aircraft are modest so far at 177, and it appears that potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new airliner's energy efficiency and savings potential.
At present, the company has a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft enters commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was progressing on schedule.
 The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected, Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the time the aircraft was down.
Every builder plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and schedule a period of updating, and that is what we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is scheduled to fly in the coming weeks, with the others to follow shortly after, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the timing of entry into service and would provide further information in the coming months.
 This slowdown in flight testing  although it appears to be in line with Bombardier's internal schedule  reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015, said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts were expecting a 10 cent per share return and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared with 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83 before.
The backlog in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion at 30 September, unchanged from 31 December of the previous year.
 In the Aerospace sector, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing, said Mr Beaudoin.
The Aerospace revenue fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the revenue of this division had increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book of the Transport division was $32.6 billion at 30 September, a slight increase on 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division suffered from performance problems on some large contracts.
Leaders announced that further guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc., would be on the board, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 were reported missing in a chasm under the Crolles Dent since Thursday evening, the Isère emergency department said on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in the practice and the other not, had gone underground Thursday around 9:30 to make a crossing of the Crolles Dent, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
The source said they had not been heard from since then.
"The cavers should have come out around 5 a.m"., said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Spéléo rescue in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on the scene
About 20 rescue workers, ten civilians from the French Spéléo secours, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
Late Friday afternoon, the two cavers were located.
"A group of other cavers, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cave, passed on the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network", explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers from the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Fighters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, turned around and waited for help, the prefecture said.
They should be able to get out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists told to avoid Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday called on its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services following new revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging services until further notice", it said in a statement.
She called "outrageous" the Washington Post report that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected massive amounts of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The journalists' research is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them", added Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
The Commission has not yet received any reply from the Commission.
Minister Brigitte Grouwels's plan to "re-lift" the traffic lights in Brussels is not for everyone.
The Minister for Public Works and Transport in Brussels launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday to repaint 16 traffic lights in the area in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both to 'increase security' and 'Brussels identity'.
The idea is to eventually repaint all the traffic lights in Brussels, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandising" the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with spending the money of the Brussels people on the re-re-re-painting of the colours of the Brussels Region's traffic lights, Brigitte Grouwels is continuing her work to flamencoise the capital", said Mr De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted the poles of Brussels in dark yellow-blue-black.
The MEP said there was now "no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The people of Brussels deserve better than to have their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is herself implementing the NVA programme.
It's high time we stopped the Trojan horse of Flanders.
'Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2 245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels population!' concluded Mr De Bock.
the Pont-de-Buis portico dismantled
The ecotox portico in Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of tax opponents took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Crane cars arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the highway was diverted in the process.
The decision to dismantle the port, announced by the Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, the port manager.
It is the last of the three ecotox gates still in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
A shop for accessories for Google Glass is launched
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers who have a prototype of Google's signature smart glasses.
They can buy a headset, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly for developers who already have Google Glass, offers a few accessories like a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, you can also buy a protective cover made of micro-fibre or an in-ear earpiece.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction lenses, no date for mass marketing has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I talked about him now,
I was so afraid I'd forget him, or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep "dating" him.
There is no recipe, no instructions for how to get past the invisible wall and find your own.
Then some signs came up.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, laid on the nightstand.
It's the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after a grueling battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her empty body, cramped in that hospital bed with the wrinkled sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a chilly farewell focused around the faint glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, in small, day or night apparitions, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that thought of mourning.
And then she would reveal herself to me, revealing aspects of myself that I hadn't yet seen, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother at all but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her time in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and set free the person I loved, and now I found her, whole and entire.
This turn of my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out", he says.
I've always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
He's been with me for a long time, when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I was in pain...
He spoke to me, he encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I could see his hands when I looked at mine, I could lend him my body.
But he was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He gave me my privacy.
It went on for a long time, and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comforting and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, and counseled.
I don't remember who said that dead people aren't forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I dream about them all the time, maybe not every night but several times a week I'm sure.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always one thing that keeps me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up anxious when this happens to me and I feel deeply missing them.
Sometimes, some dreams take me back and they become part of my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound, when I was supposed to find out the sex of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up, I was lifting myself out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the ledge and he was smiling at me and was happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing that moment with him and I enjoy sharing this shared memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year before, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
I mean, the shock of her disappearance for the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly, though.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I face difficult times or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of pursuing a master's degree at a top university, were not, in retrospect, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic as a child, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are still there, so I sometimes think about what she would want me to do at a certain point.
I try to live up to the generosity and integrity of a woman who was a devout believer.
Now I feel her as a daily presence, a caring soul, a saving spirit.
I can see her eyes falling on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I've been through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that just starts all by itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, in unusual moments.
Then time passed and the pain subsided.
All that's left is the lack, the void, the need for her to trust me, to reassure me of her sweetness.
And yet, there she is, silent presence, there she is, looking at me.
Every morning I see her worried eyes falling on me, I see the dark circles that weigh her eyes, the fine lines around her lips that smoke, the wrinkles that mark her forehead on worrying days.
My mother has taken possession of my face and she looks at me in the mirror every morning.
And every morning, I look away.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at age 43.
We feel his protection all the time, nothing bad can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, so we've gradually learned to smile again, and saying his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the dead of night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when I'm a little down.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, and the passage of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay on the path she laid out for us.
If someone loved you very much, their absence cannot take them from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father to asbestos-related cancer on August 22, 2008.
I was very close to him, always acting according to what he thought or liked.
I was unable to attend her funeral and three weeks after she died, I gave birth to a baby boy.
Even if I sometimes have different beliefs from her, I always wonder if my actions are in line with her viewpoint.
I had problems at work because of these beliefs.
I can't go the other way, I can't sleep, and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
My husband died almost thirty years ago at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The pain that I felt at that moment has of course subsided, but he is still with me.
Very often it "lands" in my dreams in such a precise, vivid way that when I wake up I am even sadder to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he said, "I'm coming down", but in such a real voice that I woke up in a fit of panic and anxiety and I lit my nightlight looking around, convinced he was coming.
I'm still living in the same house, and often I feel like I'm being watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
I feel his presence in every room and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've lived alone since he left, he's the love of my life and always will be.
I want to make it clear that I am a sociable person with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad on Friday released official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication is on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We are not telling the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it", Al-Maliki said in Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what's happening in Iraq isn't resolved, it's going to spread, and what's happening in Syria is going to spread, too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute of Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with aid.
Cocaine addict lawyer who told drug lord about police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supplying information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Assize Court in Liverpool.
A prominent defense attorney who had informed a drug lord of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was providing sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-trafficking activities after he compromised himself due to his cocaine use.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed  Bash  and considered by criminals to be a  top priority  case, was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretaps directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug-related trial.
Police officers spotted 32-year-old Sarborough dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, as he attended a Bar Association dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a  regular user  of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he illegally sought information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized £1.5m worth of heroin and cocaine, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was supplying information to criminals because he was afraid his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today in Liverpool Assize Court, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, fell out of favour after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing the drug, 60 percent pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at Ewood Park Football Stadium, home of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer went home, found the drugs, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a  regular user  of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to  legal privilege .
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken.
When questioned, he said that he had an office at his home and at his workplace and that sometimes clients called him at his home for legal questions.
But the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said:  If anyone should know that you must not break the law, it is a criminal lawyer. 
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney and getting too involved with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary boundaries of a lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has not honored his profession, but he has dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal activity and said:  If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately. 
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said:  Mr Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he started getting drugs from criminal organisations. 
His cocaine addiction permanently compromised him and made him vulnerable to the backstabbing of organized crime leaders who tasked him with obtaining valuable information for police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and establish a climate of public trust.
Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit has been conducting the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other traffickers were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta hosted a Q&A session about himself in which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin is back on stage in December.
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21st at the Sound Board Room of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Mrs. Franklin was busy in November recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying her illness, the famous Respect singer told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back".
Menton lowers the cost of its Christmas lights
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometres of beach covered in a mantle of light: we could almost hit the heat in Menton with the lighting bill.
The fact that, unlike many municipalities, is paid by the taxpayers, not by the trade associations.
To reduce costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a different management of the street lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
There's been a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
Local police say there are at least two injured.
He's an employee of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration and the shooter.
The incident is believed to have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a panic.
Passengers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Soon the police intervened and a suspected gunman was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and all air traffic is suspended.
Classical music for teenagers
Each time, the school customers will be targeted, an initiative which had been very successful in the previous season.
Five musical vignettes, created and performed by local artists, with a strong dose of humor, allow teenagers to learn classical music.
In addition to this show, the Lyric Society of the Kingdom will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now fills the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will be held in the summer of 2014, giving local artists a chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the Apéro lyrique, a benefit concert held last August, was also held with the participation of the soprano Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a for-profit activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the nonprofit organization produce a financial statement that is as sweet to the ears as a song from The Bat.
Without giving specific figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took the opportunity of the press conference held yesterday in Chicoutimi to reassure himself.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is bright, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"Finances are running out and we hope to last until the opera's 50th anniversary, a milestone we will reach in seven years", the director commented.
"I would say even beyond", added the Director-General, Hélène Gaudreault, with a smile.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey is facing six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage taking, kidnapping, making threats, carrying a weapon with dangerous intent, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The quick reactions of the officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident", said Corporal Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit has been filed against the Holy Cross Brothers, concerning alleged sexual assaults that took place at St. Joseph's Oratory and at several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the evidence of the applicant, identified as 'J. J.', who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the St. Joseph's oratory, where he served as a massmaster and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only against three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people asked us: 'I was in such a place, can I register?'", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The special feature of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows for the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse may have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
The appeal currently includes complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The facts alleged are generally older than those mentioned in the first action, since several of the establishments concerned closed in the 1960s.
The complaint also claims that the Congregation of Holy Cross and the separate St. Joseph's Oratory "permitted child sexual abuse", "exerted moral, religious and psychological pressure on the victims", "knew about the sexual abuse and yet suppressed it", and "knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
The latest charges are based on letters written by the St. Croix brothers' lawyer, Mr. Emile Perrin, in the 1990's, as well as on archival research on the matter by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former St. Croix brother who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility before the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage, the hearing on the merits, is proceeded with.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle the case before the substance of the case was heard.
Major fire in a store
A fire severely damaged a business in the LaSalle district of Montreal on Thursday night.
Emergency services were called about 1 a.m. on Friday due to a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue near the intersection with Regan Street.
The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to put the fire under control.
The fire "caused significant structural damage to the building", said Richard Bordeaux, chief of operations of the Montreal Fire Department.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
No one was injured, but about 20 homes on the first and second floors of this row of commercial buildings had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was asked to help because residents of one of the apartments may need temporary accommodation, the SIM said.
Much opposition to medical assistance in dying at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, taking place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote in favor of the principle of the medical assistance in dying bill in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective treatment to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their lives, says Maryse Bouvette, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association.
If the emphasis in Canada were on palliative care, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry worries about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life?" she lamented.
Most hospice care facilities will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice president of the Alliance of Hospice Hospice Centers.
Mrs Fitzback, who is also the director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, feels that the service would be useless anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me a shot".
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is confusing the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says the notion of end of life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenya's press outraged by controversial media law
 It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will stop Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow? , the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
 This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it, said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news radio stations and websites in Kenya.
He said the new media court  will always be biased as it is an extension of the government  and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's place in the world economy.
 I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament , he added.
The Star newspaper said the new bill would allow the government to  control the media .The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya  had been hit hard  and lambasted the bill as  draconian .
The passage of the bill comes as a package of measures to strengthen national security follows the attack by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media has angered the authorities by showing footage from surveillance cameras showing troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media outlets could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being  expelled  or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation,  even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations .
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's busy blogosphere.
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
 No one will ever know , wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for The Nation, describing Kenya's media as a key source of control over public life.
Left to their own devices, politicians would bankrupt the country and send us back to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their skyrocketing wages of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-free , among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused quite a stir at the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to the many retirements, maternity leave and short-term departures, the pharmacy department was severely understaffed.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a budget of about $1.3 billion.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire freelance staff, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
The Commission has not used the emergency services, Ms Beaudet said.
We've streamlined or scaled back some of our activities inside the facility to keep things going while things settle down.
We certainly worked hard to get our young people [in pharmacy] interested in coming and staying here.
There's a set of circumstances that put us in a bad spot last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 looks to be much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after maternity leave and three more pharmacists have been hired in the last few months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain students have paid off, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS.
Now she's much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we'll have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore be a complement to our departures from last year.
Needs Still Increasing
The situation, however, remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals and the predominance of young women in the workforce, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is still precarious, because we have a young workforce and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always have three maternity leave when things are going well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists available to do replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old supermodel doesn't start her movie career through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), chronicles the erotic memories of a 40-year-old woman who was addicted to sex since her teenage years.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig-like figure, a diaphane complexion and Franco-English origins.
And let's not forget the risky taste: the one who didn't hesitate to pose naked on the ice-cold paper is going to be shown in much more sulfuric situations on the big screen.
A snippet of "Nymphomaniac" has turned the heat up on the Web, with Stacy Martin appearing in bed in a state of ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
While the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he used X-rated professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses to their last hurdle, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished making herself known.
A room at the Narbonne RGC evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first screening of a film was interrupted at the Narbonne Mega CGR, as a precaution, following a tingling of the throat felt by the spectators.
The school director immediately evacuated the hall and alerted the fire department to a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and a full reconnaissance of the room yielded nothing.
A bad joke on the back of tear gas?
Or an accident ?
Nevertheless, the cinema management has played the principle of precaution and the safety of its customers to the fullest.
The room was aired and everything was put back in order.
The cinema was able to reclaim its rights and customers were able to enjoy the images again.
On the screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kilos of cocaine in pumpkins.
A woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in pumpkins on Halloween Thursday morning at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drugs could be detected.
The cocaine was distributed in three pumpkins that had been emptied.
The drugs were then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokeswoman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she was on her way to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border agents at the Montreal-Trudeau airport have seized 173 drugs, including 10 cocaine seizures totaling 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border agents in the Quebec region seized a total of 1,653 drugs.
Airstrike against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new raid by the IDF air force on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under almost identical circumstances to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, an unnamed US official also confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Russian-supplied surface-to-sea Yakhont missiles to Damascus.
Israeli officials have made no secret of their anger at Washington's disclosure of the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is on the brink of bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, casting doubt on the former Soviet republic's ability to meet its financial obligations after more than a year of recession.
The country's government debt rating is now B- and falls into the category of speculative investment.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least a one in three chance of it being lowered again within a year.
"It is becoming less likely that the government's strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs", the agency said.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This makes it difficult to repay loans taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use heavily to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, and the agency believes that a devaluation is increasingly likely, which would inflate its foreign debt.
Kiev also needs cash to pay for its gas imports from Russia, which accuses it of not paying a $882 million bill.
The announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian authorities at a time of heightened tensions with its neighbor Russia, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU in late November.
The report was published the day after official statistics showed that the country's economy had contracted for the fifth consecutive quarter between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, down from less than 10% before the 2008-09 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has been asking for months for help from the International Monetary Fund, which granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010, but has so far only released $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following another unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF this week found that "the large external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", but noted "signs of economic improvement".
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Policy Studies, "an improvement cannot be expected in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", the expert said, as presidential elections are scheduled for 2015.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" surrounding the possible signing of an EU-Ukraine association agreement, which Brussels is making conditional on the release of opposition figure Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term but there could be negative short and medium term consequences related to Russia's reaction", S&P said, fearing "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that if a free trade zone is established between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen border controls on imported goods.
The United States has given the green light to the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from US authorities to their merger, bringing them closer to creating the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the world's second largest agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiration of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", the two groups said in a statement.
They also said that they had obtained the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
"The merger is also conditional on further regulatory approvals and shareholder approval of both groups", they add.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat after being driven out of the northeastern areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We will pursue M23 and hunt them down wherever they hide because they are criminals", Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganise because they have been torturing the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials said they evacuated under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel's political leader, told RFI that these military setbacks would not change their demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, took over on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Fighting is reported in the hills overlooking Bunagana, the latest rebel-held town to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison's flight and the passivity of the MONUSCO blue helmets.
The fall of Goma has led the UN Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid reaction brigade made up of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
In the meantime, the FARDC has been reorganized and the army has taken the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of government troop advances is unprecedented.
"M23 seems to be coming to an end", predicts Congo Affairs expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which vehemently denies this, of providing military support to the M23, which was originally formed by former Congolese military rebels.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military retaliation for the shells that fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the residents of Bunagana took to the streets of the village to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it was unthinkable to us that we would ever be liberated by the army", said a resident of this village on the border with Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (from M23), we are traumatised", he added.
Tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a suspected coronavirus patient were negative, the health ministry announced.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of having the disease after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second largest oil company in the US, reported a drop in its quarterly profit on Friday due to a drop in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased but fell short of the group's targets.
Its net profit for the third quarter declined to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters were expecting an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The Group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company aims for 2.65 million bpd this year, with a 25% production growth expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditure has increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to USD 380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a fall in net profit on Thursday, despite rising gas and oil production.
School transport: complaint found admissible
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (SRSB) has been charging a fee of $150 per pupil (up to a maximum of $300 per family) since the beginning of the school year for pupils who are taking school transport to two residences, a service the organisation provides when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is offered by the committee and I was interested", explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to the Commission, the CSRS was invited to mediate and requested additional time to consider the matter.
"It is always better to discuss, to consult and to find solutions", said Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Regional School Board (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process when a complaint is filed.
Imbroglio over the closure of the emergency room at the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the crackdown waged for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "defer the timetable for implementing the project, and in particular the closure date of the emergency rooms, which cannot be 4 November".
A request made officially "to avoid any risk to the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although the term 'transformation' or 'continuous change' is preferred in the HPA.
From 4 November, firefighters - who were responsible for about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency room visits to the Hôtel-Dieu - will all be instructed to take about 30 serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also coincides with the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the emergency room will be opening up on Monday to five general practitioners.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it's scheduled for this month.
"The emergency department at the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4", says Loïc Capron, chairman of the hospital medical committee (CME) of the APPH, who supports the management's plan.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the fire brigade, only people coming by their own means", confirms Dr. Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in the emergency room", he warns, pointing to the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency medical technicians will remain on site, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide whether the emergency room should be closed.
"Things are being done gradually", says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, who said on 4 November that "there will be no change in terms of service provided".
"The minister lied to us or was lied to", laments emergency physician Gerald Kierzek.
He was dismissed from his post as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the charge against the reorganisation project, and described himself as a "warner" in the face of a "cynical" decision by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergency rooms that were renovated less than five years ago", he says.
He said: "If the other emergency services in Paris could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
But they are regularly congested.
For example, there is sometimes a nine-hour wait at the Lariboisière emergency room.
The ARS argues that 30 patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the AHP are advocates of the 'new hospital model' which has been in operation since 7 October and which should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to join the establishment of a 'permanent outpatient care'.
"Where does it go if people are asked to self-diagnose", asks Gerald Kierzek, who regards "the concept of a non-serious emergency" as "dangerous" and a "medical regression".
It's gonna be like the level three maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where the best care is available.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, a UMP councillor from Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the UMP in Paris were in favour of keeping the emergency rooms at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, on the other hand, again reminded France Inter on Monday morning that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If this were the case, it would be a clear disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, its spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot allow it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama ends wiretapping of IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a US official said on Thursday.
The move is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA wiretapping case after revelations by former analyst Edward Snowden, who is now a refugee in Russia.
This is the first mention of the IMF and World Bank being monitored by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
When asked about this, a U.S. administration official said: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington".
The official, who did not wish to be named, did not say whether such surveillance had been done in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the cessation of the practice in recent weeks.
This instruction was given about the same time as the end of the wiretapping at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved increased scrutiny of government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
UN welcomes new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is now working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set 12 years ago to fight world poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the  Sustainable Development Goals  to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were part of the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to  overcome national interests .
 I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs) , he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique are growing as conflicts break out between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration.
 We want peace back; we want stability , said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she traded her work clothes for a T-shirt that read  we want security  in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for the growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the US's Anadarko.
The FRELIMO, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo have mutually denied responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflicts and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use all his remaining strength to try to prove he could impose his decisions on the government.
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
 We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness, Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
 They are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are always fighting , explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to get concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of the vote for Renamo has been falling steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM) which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza  who is due to retire at the end of his second term next year  wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
 He does not want multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , said Mr. Mazanga.
It is not known exactly what capacity Renamo has, but it has conducted disruptive lightning strikes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the collisions took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr Mazanga was falsely timid when asked whether Renamo would reiterate this threat.
Renamo wanted to  warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , Mazanga said.
The instability has added to the government's frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many are also concerned about corruption, slow progress and the recent wave of kidnappings.
 People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country's future, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems, he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
 Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads , he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as  models of lifestyle, says the author.
The Legend of Thor might show that  brute force does not outweigh subtle cunning , while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be  far too violent, far too outrageous and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught in school, Crossley-Holland advocated  careful selection  of works appropriate to the age.
"I think it's great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are  openly didactic  makes children  completely drop out , with messages being  sublimated  in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said:  You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight. 
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simple or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it needs to be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and what we don't say.
A fighter from Hamas's armed wing was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza say.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian Territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: US 'going too far', Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, Secretary of State John Kerry has admitted, in the first admission by Washington amid a dispute with Europe over the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time an American government official has explicitly admitted to controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I will admit to you, as the president has, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen again in the future", John Kerry said at a conference in London, which he attended from Washington on Thursday, October 31, via video link.
In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the US foreign minister at length justified intelligence and intelligence gathering practices by the need to fight terrorism and prevent possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry said that the US authorities had since thwarted many planned attacks by intercepting communications and gathering information.
"We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to know about these plans in advance", the chief diplomat said.
And, as John Kerry told the Europeans, 'I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process.'
But we're trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far in an inappropriate way", admitted the Secretary of State, who had previously had to speak out about the international scandal during a tour last week of Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday evening that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and that he was reviewing these practices so that no one feels deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to flare this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, citing documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program, dubbed "MUSCULAR", and run with the NSA's British counterpart, GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by the internet giants.
According to one report, some 181 million items were collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails to text items or audio and video documents.
These intercepts are said to be outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement in these practices.
In the last ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have reported that the NSA has intercepted massive amounts of data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was unaware of such wiretapping, Barack Obama refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
But the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had intercepted tens of millions of European citizens' communications.
He even passed the ball back to European intelligence services who would have seized the communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and would not be aimed at Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans in a vast international spy ring that has also drawn the ire of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will host Lorient on Friday without their star player, the injured Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, the league's top goal scorer against Monaco, have released the list of players selected for the 12th day's match, but the 32-year-old striker is not on it.
The statement simply said he was "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
He was suffering from left knee inflammation when he returned to the team earlier this month.
A ceremony in memory of cremated dead
The Father Lachaise crematorium holds a secular ceremony at 11 a.m. in memory of all the deceased cremated in its facility during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris, will attend and then explain her proposals for the funeral at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people are choosing cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos survey of 1,009 people on 6 and 7 September, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a relative, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they are unlucky enough to lose a child, only 15% of them choose cremation.
In his book Death by Ashes, philosopher and vice-chairman of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, Damien Le Guay, emphasizes the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence against the body of a loved one", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompanied the mourning phases".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is "the erasure of the singularity and distinctive marks" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is it that what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries is still not lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new thing", says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatology Society and author of the book Tame the Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to tame cremation is to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as the one to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong attachment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77% of French people want a family member, whether religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Now 73 percent of those who have chosen cremation want a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematories have adapted to this changing society.
"For about ten years they have been trying to save families from the violence of waiting, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the laying of the ashes", says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now have ceremonial masters who perform the following ritual in the presence of the body: greeting the assembly, naming the deceased, connecting him with others, recalling him, giving meaning to his death, arranging the farewell.
That's been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
The master of ceremonies are often people who have been converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Father Lachaise crematorium has organized, since 2010, on All Saints' Day, several memorial ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who were cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies will be broadcast online for those who cannot make the trip.
The crematorium has authorized us to relay it.
In the Seine, the relocation of rats is controversial
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of Terres du Sud Habitat proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to move the couple and their three children to a new apartment.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has become exaggerated, says Joel Canapa, director of the agency.
Rats, they've always been in cities.
The de-waste company makes two trips a year, and we also take care of every request from the residents at our expense.
We have thus carried out 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the city is not swarming with rats.
For environmental and public health reasons, de-icing products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, you're not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite the rats into our home", says the father who moved out of his apartment to a hotel.
Soon we are out of money and waiting for a new place to live, at the same price as the old one.
The Tokyo stock market ends up down 0.88%
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The stock has suffered from the fall in the dollar against the yen, which is hurting export values and the warning on its annual earnings released by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index fell 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57, and the Topix index fell 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony has fallen more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house burns in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters have been dispatched to 9 Hébert Street.
The fire started in a three-story, four-story apartment building behind the courtyard of the Quebec City Seminary.
All the tenants were away when the fire broke out.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the firefighters arrived, who were numerous to respond.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw visible smoke.
"So the alarms were going off, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck together here", said France Loiselle, a spokeswoman for the Quebec City Fire Department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival , and the first time the New Yorker has ever seen it .
You could say New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
 Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club, Hirsch said.
We created this festival so that we could continue to work with them.
This year's event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of  Stand Up for Heroes , a comedy and music benefit night for veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will feature Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown, and so has the comedy world.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone on non-traditional tours, such as presenting shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his front-stage appearance in a cable sitcom ( The League themed on FXX's happily lewd fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a cast member on Saturday Night Live and was a cast member on Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young voice actors (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic racial justice advocate W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called  Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is at City Hall in midtown Manhattan.
 The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry's work, Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down an alley between two buildings and think, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here".
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $ 96 a barrel .
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about stockpiles outweigh a report showing that China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of US crude oil for delivery in December fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning electronic trading in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8 percent drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector on Friday, showing growth in activity, suggested a rise in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery may continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline not seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, has lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Texas's right to abortion challenged
A federal appeals court has reinstated in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary abortion that were blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State that largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The Court of Appeal's decision means that doctors who perform IVF will have to have "admission privileges" from local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a member of a hospital medical staff, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to make a diagnosis or provide treatment.
The defenders of the IVG argue that the content of the law risks resulting in the immediate closure of one third of the state clinics because these clinics have failed to secure this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it is estimated that nearly 22,000 women will be denied access to these facilities.
On Monday, a lower court judge ruled that the provisions on the privilege of admission were unconstitutional the day before the law came into force.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican running for governor, asked the appellate court to overturn the trial court's ruling blocking enforcement of the law.
A hearing on this matter is scheduled for January.
The New Star has made a strong comeback in terms of viewership, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show on the date?
Some 10,000 candidates showed up for the auditions this 10th season to face the judges: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the thrill of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have scored at this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows featured a wide variety of aspiring singers, for better or worse.
But on Twitter, you want spectacle, you want emotion, you want originality, you want music.
Fortunately, some have found their way.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even went all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are still there, season after season.
Others just want to make you laugh.
The court blocked a decision regarding the NYPD's search and seizure policy.
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision to require changes to the New York Police Department's surveillance and search program and dismissed her from the case.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was adjourned pending the outcome of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign an inspector to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The court of appeals heard arguments on Tuesday regarding the motion for a stay.
The Court of Appeal held that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for Judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongfully targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their surveillance and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including reform of policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in the most controlled neighborhoods.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the City should take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of search and seizure has been criticized by many civil rights activists.
This system of search and seizure has existed in some form for decades, but the number of searches recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to its all-time high in 2011 with 684,330 searches that mostly involved black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and it developed into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's search and seizure program say they will end unfair practices, make police forces more efficient and trusted, and may change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers were sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge emphasized that she was not ending the surveillance and search practices, which are constitutional, but she was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants have to go vote because each of them pays an average of $100 a month on the house price that goes into the city tax.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in city taxes, he splits that amount between each home.
We're forced to raise rents to help pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make a change in the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the outrageous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 worth of fireworks, $4 million to $5 million worth of land just in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough.
The end of the work of the chef at the Elysee
Having entered the 500 m2 of the Elysee Kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the chef rose through the ranks to become chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and nurtured countless world greats in a near-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of his retirement at 60.
The man with the open face, scalp and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry chef's license.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have moved from one castle to another!" quipped Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the habits of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their distinguished guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus", he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight into the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women from the Elysee kitchens!
It is not a good thing for heads of state to show a relative indifference to land-based food, "they are all greedy", Bernard Vaussion says.
Jacques Chirac had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had eliminated cheese, the plates came back empty!
François Hollande, who revived cheese, "is a food lover" and "there is little he does not like".
The current head of state, who regained the weight he lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific dietary demands".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure on his shoulders, especially at state dinners at the Élysée: "200 to 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Élysée, who had a drink with his team, family and friends on Tuesday evening, leaves with a pinch of heart.
He said something about praise.
"His human side came out", he says.
The head will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysee for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic home built in 1850 was engulfed in flames in Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-bedroom building at 15 Hébert Street has received three alarms from the fire department.
The fire started in the front, but spread to the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokeswoman for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said the quick response of the firefighters prevented the flames from spreading to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this part of the city where buildings are built close together.
The house that caught fire had four apartments, but no tenants were in the house when the fire broke out.
The damage was limited, even if the water did cause some damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the source, but the sappers have ruled out the possibility of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second trailer released
Martin Scorsese has released a few images from his upcoming film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an ambitious New York stockbroker.
Forget being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is gonna be the one to blow your hair out as the crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a "Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with authorities in a massive corruption case on Wall Street".
In the '80s, Jordan Belfort then stages a scam that will make him a rich man, very rich.
An opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that followed.

Decadence and excess of all kinds are the key words in this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have rediscovered the magic that brought them together in Shutter Island.
The release of Scorsese's new film was delayed because of its lengthy editing.
Looks like the movie's finally running 2:45.
On the 25th of December, he will be able to take part in the Oscar race.
Coulson used the phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used  phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation  to try to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with Hannah Pawlby, his  pretty special adviser.
It was reported to the court that the newspaper had instructed Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and  permanently plant it outside her door, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
 The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man who stands outside people's houses hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they think , said Mr. Edis.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate the subjects: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
He's obviously aware of the second one, surveillance, he can't help it.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say  Of course it is .
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she was told:  Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles. 
A tape, which recorded hacked voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator's computer that involved Miss Pawlby and her sister filed in a file  Projects .
During the period the detective investigated her, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of every move and deed of Miss Pawlby.
In a voice message he left her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said:  I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to tell Charles. 
Mr Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as other important men, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have all admitted to hacking into the phone.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister amid violence
The US president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking US help to fight the worst wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released by Iraqi authorities on Friday, November 1.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher toll, with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence has been escalating despite the increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched over the past months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the US troops withdrew, the level of violence is raising fears of a new outbreak as neighboring Syria is engulfed in civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even in their homes, and security forces are also frequently the target of attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complain of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has contributed to this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, renewed violence killed four people in northern Iraq, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the blast of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists) that is also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against Al Qaeda.
The violence is the focus of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. president, elected on the promise of ending military involvement in the country, had painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has held several meetings with the executive branch and elected officials in Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, as partly responsible for the resurgence of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian politics".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing blames Uighur group for Tiananmen attack
China's head of internal security on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Monday.
The SUV plunged into a crowd in the famous square of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the 1989 bloody crackdown, and caught fire, killing three passengers and two bystanders.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, blamed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement for the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
The Chinese government blames the movement for the frequent outbreaks of violence in the country, which are fuelled by demands for independence.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated", Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the East Turkestan Islamic Movement", he added, as quoted by China News Agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin, and said his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The last one also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 injured.
The East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues like contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests treat gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united in marriage.
The survey was sent to each national bishops' conference in mid-October, with the instruction to get as many responses as possible.
The information will be used at a major family rally that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to properly survey parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the poll on the Internet, urging Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks last rebel stronghold
The M23's hardline fighters, numbering a few hundred, were entrenched at an altitude of nearly 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, some 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu Province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night", said a resident of Jomba, who was contacted by phone at about 12:30 and said a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the fighting has lessened a bit", he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a bit".
According to the witness, who did not want to be named, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before heading to the front for a "scrubbing operation".
The crackling of small arms could be heard very clearly behind him.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP reporter could hear heavy weapons exploding.
According to a source at the UN Stabilisation Mission in the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase" as the FARDC "surrounded the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, MONUSCO has not been directly involved in the fighting, but has provided government troops with decisive intelligence, observation and planning support.
By late afternoon, dozens of well-armed soldiers were marching toward the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, soldiers with the help of civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to replace another vehicle bombing M23 positions in the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday night again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" or be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been holding talks since December without result so far.
The M23 political leaders there hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, the only thing left is for the Ugandan mediation to arrange the signing", said Roger Lumbala, deputy head of the M23 delegation, without immediate confirmation from the government.
M23 was formed in April 2012 by former rebels, mostly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsoil is rich in coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where the UN says about 5,000 people took refuge between Monday and Wednesday, the movement back to the DRC that began in the morning reversed at noon.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to go back", Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back.
It's like the gunfire is getting closer to the population.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, that stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French, singing and dancing productions are taking off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: French musicals are establishing themselves as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre Dame in Paris to Mozart to rock opera, most attempts would end in ridicule.
And the hits like Cabaret and Les Misérables were all about mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage-Entertainment in Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles like hit records.
The first takes up his excellent My Fair Lady this Christmas and announces the world premiere of "An American in Paris" for the next.
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" may be one of the biggest hits of the season.
On the other stages, musicals such as 1789 and Bastille Lovers and small musicals such as Disco and Life and Times are combined with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histories of Musical Comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.
How are French musicals evolving?
The supply has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the producers' wishes...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story, like in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump back 15 years on the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the head of the line.
Then there are the musicals with the lavish productions of the Châtelet, which bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the world of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment is making popular a wide variety of Anglo-Saxon musicals by adapting them into French.
The French independent producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects such as Rent, The Spider Woman's Kiss and Spring Awakening are struggling to get funding.
Do we have enough performers who can sing, act and dance like on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists working on projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
There are plenty of jobs between regional theaters, touring, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are the provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often theatre for adults and not young adults.
The musical performances fill this gap.
It's these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as short-lived stars...
The idea of attractive (often talented) young men as the star of a musical performance is sure to captivate these girls and often their entire families.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly run by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive at a provincial zenith.
Mayonnaise was made in Paris and enjoyed by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major theaters in France in the same form as in Paris.
A man seriously injured in a crash with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident left one seriously injured at about 5.30 a.m. on Friday morning on the inner ring road in Brussels, at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A female driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the crash site, while the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, caused little traffic jams as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry from the ring.
A child seriously injured in a Disneyland Paris attraction
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His life expectancy is now out of the question, but he's still in the hospital.
At the time of the crash, the boy was with his father on a boat from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction.
It's been closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares for another attack
Children play on a charred armored vehicle belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, on October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing for another assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in eastern DRC on Friday.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
All that's left is Runyonyi Hill.
"The one in Chanzu is not very strategic", said Julien Paluku, governor of North Kivu.
Mr. Paluku is planning to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
The town is a political stronghold and the last stronghold of the rebellion, located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 hardliners have been entrenched at an altitude of nearly 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who reported close fighting throughout the day on Thursday said the situation was "calm since this morning".
He said a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the day before and buried.
A girl was shot and three others were injured, including one seriously, who was evacuated by the FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, neither side has reported any casualties.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's national intelligence agency, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 3 miles from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports that the BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation led to an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of US intelligence, again insisted in September that the US does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to  steal industrial secrets from foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits .
But ever since Edward Snowden, the consultant turned whistleblower, began to reveal his never-ending treasure trove of information about U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate executives have been left wondering whether to take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised more than ever the paranoia of companies about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel's back.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made the intense collaboration between US intelligence and corporate transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data could be used in their mutual interest.
 Germany must wake up , says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the US poses a risk as high as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultancy EY.
However, in all the documents released by Mr Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has passed on industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks sufficient computer and internet capabilities and believe it should work to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
 This is not the right way to do it, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies who had previously thought China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is happening in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the US is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members abandoned plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, says:  Our customers are asking us a question today that they didn't ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will stay physically in that jurisdiction? 
Many German officials say the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It's no surprise that there's economic espionage.
There's always been.
 This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion, says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose their prevention measures in case this gives an opponent an advantage.
Large companies have long been harping on the message that it is at least unwise to take a free USB flash drive to a trade show or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at carmaker Audi, says that collecting cell phones before board meetings, so they can't be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of breach of the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
 SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as second-degree guilty of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage,  the French are the worst .
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month:  The services know full well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. 
Parents of a teenager who died in unusual circumstances in Georgia believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled up in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found Jan. 11 trapped in a tapestry standing behind the stands of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators have concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family disputes those findings.
 They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered, Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as the sheriff's findings indicate.
 They think it defies all logic, laws of physics and common sense, Crump added.
They believe that these conclusions were made for the sole purpose of covering up the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
They sent their son to school with a bag and he was returned to them in a body bag, he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'm gonna follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
 I consider that there is a sufficient basis  to open a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of  positional asphyxia .
However, a second autopsy identified a different cause of death, according to Moore.
 Several questions still need to be answered or confirmed, he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that would warrant a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A judge in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to turn over all surveillance video recordings investigators had reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage would provide clues as to the circumstances of his death.
CDC issues child allergy guidance for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in children at school.
This is the first set of guidelines the U.S. government has issued since the number of school-age children with food allergies soared.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to make teachers and staff aware of food allergies in children and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine  the branded EpiPen auto-injector being the most commonly used  to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say,  I feel like something is stinging my tongue ,  I feel like I have a hair on my tongue  or  I have tingling on my tongue .
The NSA case highlights the complete absence of debate about intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is publicly offended by the summoning of the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand bans the Bolivian presidential plane from flying over the territory, on the basis of the rumor of the presence of Edward Snowden on board?
I think there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US Ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance of all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of US diplomatic correspondence and, on the other, a condemnation of the eavesdropping on the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't that be a little bit of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for interesting and relevant information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis of US diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the light of American power, it is an important illumination.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any way to express indignation at this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we not have American cooperation ?
The introduction of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States and France over the last decade has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this field, in particular, France and the United States have established procedures for cooperation and almost daily exchanges of information, which both sides describe as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France, for example, can be led to provide the US with entire blocks of data on the Sahel region, and in return - as has been said very quickly - the Americans can provide the French with information on other parts of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the justification for such systems, the scope that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of the encroachments on freedoms.
What is the real risk to the United States?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk to the Americans may be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest levels of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries with which diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: in the light of the revelations, more and more European and South American companies are reluctant to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US law, and thus to the control of the NSA.
Finally, the widespread revelation by the world's media, which is helping to ignite a previously almost non-existent debate about the surveillance practices of the intelligence services, may prompt lawmakers, including the United States, to reconsider the powers they have given their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose  gender undefined 
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The sex of newborn babies will no longer be assigned rigidly at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's gender, allowing them to enter a gender  undefined  or  unspecified  on his birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later,  I am neither male nor female. 
I'll just be the patchwork the doctors created, bruised and bruised.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being one of the group of about 60 diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and an expert on gender identity issues, said the new German law  seems like a good idea .
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
 Some people have extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but most children do not , he added.
It's possible to do a sex assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hair, breast and height), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sex organs), or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the employment discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-based crime.
Young boys who do not conform to the gender now have camps specifically for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register their gender as male, female or  third gender  on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognised as  neutral  after winning her appeal trial which allowed her to keep a gender  unspecified  for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F  X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this largely Catholic country signed a petition to have the  gender theory  removed from schoolbooks.
The US Catholic Online website also opposed the German law, writing that  as the world is being dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, two other pillars of civilization are being overturned. 
In Maryland, a mother of a newborn also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer that babies be assigned a sex at birth.
 Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your child , she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a slate, one that you can erase and re-draw on.
But now many question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can make mistakes, not knowing how a child will feel about his sex reassignment when he grows up.
 In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,  Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was advanced by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is malleable.
He devoted the term  gender identity  and argued that social and environmental cues  the way parents raise a child  interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape him so that he is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as  John/Joan , his theories gave rise to controversy.
He advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to have him castrated completely, including his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
 Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it was not the case, Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors  always repeat this pattern .
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex-change operations say they are not satisfied with the results.
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn't really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a  satisfying life  as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had surgery to remove his external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She started taking female hormones at age 12.
 I knew I wasn't a girl , he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing testosterone therapy and having his breasts removed.
The surgery rendered him infertile.
Today, he is an advocate for others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize perceptions of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law  encourages labeling and stigma .
 Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "undetermined" sex, she said.
We're afraid she's going to encourage the interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female gender and wait.
But we haven't seen what the law is going to do, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law because it  allows adults to choose to be recognised as a third gender .
 Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender, she added.
The German law concerns the assignment of sex at birth.
It's not a battle that young kids should be fighting at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands in a support group, said the German law  will make parents and children responsible.
Dr. Baratz' daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of her androgen receptor failure, Katie developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a resident in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
 The law gives parents some leeway so they don't have to make hasty decisions, said Baratz.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before they can write  male  or  female .
So, everything is fine - you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and you're enjoying the joys of parenthood.
You don't have to rush into surgery that's irreversible.
 It puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing , she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with  and that is something wonderful.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident of the longevity of his government
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta believes his government will hold out until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right in the ruling coalition as the Senate vote to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office approaches.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "firmly intended" to continue governing with his coalition until the next general election in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Council president convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to yield to the orders of Berlusconi, who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency agent and a suspect were injured in the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene said they responded to a call that "multiple injuries" were reported.
"The police are on the scene", the airport said on Twitter, while TV images showed people being evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting", a spokesman for the US Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
Local ABC broadcast one person being evacuated on a stretcher, and another being carried in a wheelchair.
The incident occurred around 9:30 local time (12:30 Montreal time) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
A TSA spokesman was unable to immediately confirm whether any of his employees were injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, health officials said.
A source from Hamas said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely mentioned a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel designated as "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug on the border and announced to have been discovered in mid-October.
Report: Obama campaign considered to be dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to The New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event to be featured in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly anticipated 2012 campaign book,  Double Down: Game Change 2012 .
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's close aides had conducted  extensive group work and polls in late 2011  to see if removing Biden could help Obama toward re-election as his hopes waned.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to gauge what effect the replacement of the vice president with former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election.
The possibility of a trade is a closely guarded secret at the Chicago campaign headquarters and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president  including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe  knew the change was being considered.
 Double Down  indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their  close personal ties , before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list  did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success .
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
 I said I had looked into a whole series of questions, and this was one of them, Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review  concerted , Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out whether the change would be beneficial in the election.
 Campaigns don't spend much money on polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking action, Martin said on AC360.
However, it's unclear if Obama was aware that his team was considering a replacement.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president  knew  about the possible change, the former secretary general admitted that it was  possible  that Obama knew.
Martin added that  Double Down  did not definitively answer the question of whether political polls had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was being considered.
"Maybe", said Martin.
How about some ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first fluorescent jellyfish ice cream.
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by raising the pH of the protein to make it glow.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick it, the more it becomes shiny.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company  Lick Me I'm Delicious , said:  This is something incredible but we are still in the early stages of production, and 2 grams of this stuff costs about £200. 
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the glow of jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But she 's pretty good .
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation looks even more ambitious.
He added:  I really want to develop an invisible ice. 
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to make it happen.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session.
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the East Hampton Star regional newspaper and addressed to residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, looking out over the trees and performing the famous 21st move of tai chi with his musician's hands slicing through the air", writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also said that she had promised her husband the week before he died that she would get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the last few years.
And even though we are citizens of the city, it is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had", she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up to go around the neighborhood.
Today I've become more persistent.
In the last two years, I haven't given out a single candy and I certainly won't do it again this year.
But the stats show that I'm the grumpy sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
Disguises are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are all the rage.
Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet Daft Punk's space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most searched for disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed up as hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't go gliding.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This is about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go candy-hunting in their neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat, and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like  Terror Behind the Walls  (which is actually a real prison),  Howl-O-Scream  and  The House of Shock .
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these amazing photos of you peeing on yourself that your friends post on Facebook and you can't take off and that a guy you like leaves a comment on like "pretty head".
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree -- it's something we've been doing since we were very young.
Luckily for us, the pumpkin baby trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that are slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 2,000-pound pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will set up a bad bank structure with £38bn (€45bn) of high-risk assets internally to ease its relationship with London and speed up its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of non-performing assets on its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also said it would write an additional £4 to £4.5 billion in impairment provision for non-performing loans over the quarter, a write-off linked to the establishment of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up capital of GBP 10 to 11 billion, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the 'bad bank' would be a way of putting the past behind us, especially as the government has been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, focus on the future and the 90 per cent of assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for customers and for the UK", new CEO Ross McEwan told reporters.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service giving access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between events.
Drew Bowler, the CEO of Bowler Motorsport said:  The rally fans joining Bowler have changed. 
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of racing.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle  the championship is going to be really exciting. 
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after it was trapped 50 feet above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry.
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a car accident without gravity.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters came down the cliff to rescue the dog and save her from certain death.
A puppy was lucky to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve it safely while it was perched 50 feet above the ground on an unstable ledge of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
The owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for their lost dog and had made a call on social media after she disappeared in the quarry following a minor accident.
At approximately 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, trapped 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and came down to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to carry her up the cliff.
Emergency medical technician Andy Clayton said:  She was in a precarious situation. 
It was in the middle of the cliff, 50 feet from the top and 50 feet from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue  she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some cookies afterwards.
That was a very unusual call.
I can't believe anyone noticed the dog.
Emergency medical technician Peter Lau said:  Ruby was very lucky to survive. 
She could have been seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and her general condition was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said:  I was terrified as I watched the rescue. 
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to hold her again.
The vet said if she was too exhausted and passed out, she probably would have fallen.
The fire department was amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We're so grateful to them, each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added:  We were afraid she might fall but she did not move. 
The fire department was great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing vocalist on Jagger's song  Old Habits Die Hard  in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He hit on me when I was 18".
She added,  It was a long time ago, and he was very nice. 
In a statement on Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies ever making any advances to Katy Perry".
The representative added:  Maybe she's confusing him with someone else. 
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album,  Prism , landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing accuses Turkmen Islamic movement of being behind the attack
"The backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia", the head of China's security services told a Hong Kong television station, according to a video posted on a website Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has named a particular organization since Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, drove their car loaded with petrol cans into the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing in a suicide attack that killed two and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, formerly known as Xinjiang, was listed by the UN in 2002 as an al-Qaeda affiliate.
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the European free movement area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While the Strathclyde newspaper did mention the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not (and should not have been) in the headlines.
Nor did anyone say that EU Member States spend a lot of their time bypassing formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for whatever it wants from the Scots.
So this is a story that is not a story.
And a story so old that it's now frozen: I first heard the rumour that  independence means passport control  over 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been overlooked in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, anyway?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
The real news about Europe is this: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposed to the EU or advocating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming out of nowhere, won almost five million votes in the September federal elections and ousted the Liberal Democrat Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the lock on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits  this was only true for Greece.
The European system has instead imposed on its members exchange rates favourable to German exporters  which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make the big cuts in wages and public spending encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper productivity malaise in Europe.
Following the  green  energy policies imposed by Brussels  which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer  European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US.
This is a costly disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt rages, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the struggling French economy to grapple.
The result: Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote  a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the white French working class?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-monetary and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties win this election, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
I think that very soon anti-European sentiment and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the Europe of the (sovereign) nations, the free Europe favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will have their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will turn a blind eye to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement provided we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise we should follow Norway's example and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  and it should be noted  the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence now if it is to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty - Aging early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The tendency toward premature puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new norm.
 I spend a lot of time reassuring parents  generally, this does not indicate a rapid progression towards full puberty , Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, underarm and pubic hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight increase in the age of first menstruation in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is now 12 and a half years, up from 12 years in 1970.
 Once the breasts have begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first menstrual periods appear, says Kaplowitz, who also wrote Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will progress.
There is debate as to what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered to be early  when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, the development slows down or stops  this is something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster course may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and shrink in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication but acknowledges that  controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others .
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
 They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues, Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls a mother whose daughter had her first period when she was 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset about being first among her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or the sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is that there is an obesity epidemic.
He was part of a study of girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat percentage to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, the mechanisms of premature puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have facial hair and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency toward true early puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common, even in infants and toddlers.
 We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
 This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected, explained Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls who are in early puberty need to be reassured that even if it happens sooner than expected, it is a normal part of life.
A tribute to the Coen Brothers folk
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, winner of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic, funny film about the Greenwich Village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been shown at the Cinémathèque française, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
When they couldn't hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen turned their attention to rising American movie star Oscar Isaac, 33, and also to global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is the central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with an infectious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she's moved from the rich outfits of Daisy Mulligan in "The Magnificent Gatsby" to less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the machine gun-shot swear word when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" is about a week of tribulations for a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry at the whole world.
He's willing to back down on the replacements in the studios.
He's homeless, he's just going around the couches of his friends who still want to see him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of bad luck, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not career-oriented but who's honest, with self-destructive behavior", Ethan Coen, who won several Oscars and awards at Cannes with his brother Joel, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans based their story on real figures of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich Village, a New York neighborhood destined to become "the epicenter of the folk music boom that would spawn international stars", as Van Ronk's friend Elijah Wald wrote.
The film then takes on the look of a documentary, from the dusty music label filled with unsold 33T's inhabited by an old, unpaid secretary, to the musical choices of the studios and cafes where the singers performed.
The Coen brothers' magic still works with a funny character that runs through the film all the time: a beautiful, sparkly-eyed red cat, Llewyn Davis' lucky companion.
When asked how he came up with his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled growing up in Tennessee, "bathed in blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar", he added.
For Justin Timberlake, while work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "increasingly today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that might prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He's never heard of retirement.
French publishing phenomenon, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, The New York Times hailed him as "the spy novelist who knew too much".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the setting for the 198th and 199th installments of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically disabled by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling with a walker during this trip.
And before Afghanistan, he also went back to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SASs published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, claimed to be unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million in all countries combined", he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his lap, in the living room of his huge apartment building on Foch Avenue, a few steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages into which the adventures of the SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions", he added, pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table among the bronzes or ivory brought from the 130 countries surveyed to place his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the picture of a young woman with a good chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractor to pay for the repairs to the family castle, sets out to hunt down all the bad guys on earth, communists in the 1970s and 1980s, then jihadists from the 1990s onwards.
Each book has the same recipe: a lot of geopolitics and exoticism, some hardcore sex, a hint of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary writer", explained Gérard de Villiers.
I think of myself as a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't text.
He worked "like the great prewar reporters, the Albert London type, who went there and came back with real, long investigations".
The SAS father said, "Make some kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I always follow my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave", added Gérard de Villiers.
There I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the intelligence services whom I have known for some 20 or 30 years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often prescient: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In "The Madmen of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in that city, the birthplace of the Libyan uprising.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the bombing.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported on the jihadist 4X4 columns that were founding in the Malian capital.
I am not a fortune teller, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he would sit for a month behind his IBM daisy typewriter from 1976 "whose parts had all been changed".
300 pages later, he would write the word "FIN" and correct each page with a pen.
On the walls of his office are AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly accused of being a sexist by feminist leagues and of racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent, brave women.
I am always welcomed in Africa, where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He's not going to die or retire.
No more than I do.
Aircraft manufacturers are fighting over seat width as big orders are at stake
The dispute rages among major aircraft manufacturers over the width of passenger seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers  who are not always the most sought after by airlines, but for whom the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft introduced by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the airline industry to set a standard for a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy class, but its big US rival Boeing says it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as aircraft manufacturers look to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping for a record number of orders at the event from November 17-21.
The way the seats will be arranged in the rear of the aircraft  in particular, whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats  is essential to the economic performance of the  mini-jumbo  segment.
Boeing says its redesigned  777X  will be able to seat 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
The giants of the aviation industry often exchange blows on technical matters by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is making a direct appeal to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the lead with over 100 orders.
We recently saw what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people fighting each other in a restaurant, titled Would You Take This?
 Boeing offers long-haul flights in smaller seats than in regional turboprop aircraft, said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people get fatter, but the seats on planes haven't changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 became the defining jet of modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 gained 10 percent more weight, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.
The average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches tall, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the newly named  jet set  aircraft's circumference was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that shows that an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures for seat width and says it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says the study shows that the cabin experience is not just dependent on seat width.
 It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to run their business , said Kent Craver, Boeing's passenger satisfaction manager.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
The dispute is being driven by a race for orders for aircraft worth an estimated $700 billion or more at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat efficiency in their latest long-haul twin engine models 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance is based in part on comparison between the 777X configured with 10 rows of seats and the original 777 model configured with 9 rows.
The unit cost savings are small compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
 Boeing is doing this to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by comparing our products, said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
 An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial standpoint, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the 777's threat, said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The aircraft dealers who travel the world carry even a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While they pride themselves on offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasised the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider aisle-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say its call to the airline industry for a standard size for seats is unlikely to succeed, but it could make the 777X's sales surge go away.
Oracle shareholders are angry about Ellison's salary.
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against a proposed compensation for founder and CEO Larry Ellison Thursday, given his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but it does tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third richest man in the world just topped off by his boat's victory in the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software company he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had already suffered a negative vote on his pay.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he did receive about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a token dollar.
Over the entire 2013 fiscal year, Oracle's net profit increased 3.5% while the stock market jumped 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which rose 24% over the same period.
New nicotine vaccine could take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that could take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from lifelong nicotine addiction.
More tests are needed before human trials can begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial signs were encouraging.
 We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches, said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his or her dose of nicotine.
In tests, vaccinated mice that were then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mice that were not vaccinated were calmed down, the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proven ineffective because they contain antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently to keep antibody levels high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the new vaccine should be much cheaper because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use were completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing any addiction to nicotine.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
 They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this may help them to quit their bad habit, he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time he was killed in the strike, which was carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike", a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was on a visit to London, had informed the British government that talks had been started with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the commercial leasing policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) widened its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a cafe, after they expired in August 2005 without a tender.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr. Tripodi's former assistant general secretary, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of negotiations that began in 2005, the government pushed for the leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer tenure.
In 2009, leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which were earning the Obeids about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any bidding.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister for Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr Obeid who, Tripodi acknowledged, was calling for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior civil servant who had come to the Department of Ports after working under Mr Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
 Was the topic of discussion during these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing policy? , asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
"No", said Mr Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer didn't specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with a 457 visa may have to pass an authenticity test
The government is currently considering the possibility of introducing a  authenticity test  for foreign workers with a 457 visa as it plans to expand the crackdown.
The test, if passed, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used to fill unqualified positions or as a misguided means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labor MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's discourse on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
 The stark statements about 'foreigners going back to the bottom of the queue' and 'Australians first jobs' are a nasty return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market , she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor had to be protected  and I wouldn't be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working document outlines the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the proposed changes, with the others under consideration.
If the  authenticity  criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for  authenticity of the job offer if the applicant is a personal relation or associate of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company .
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, intending to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught 9-year-old son was travelling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father died on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project  would bring the UK together .
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was 'excited' to be working with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will be a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised up the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study building rail capacity and improving journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said:  Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together. 
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better with HS2.
The UK Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added:  Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. 
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support  unequivocally  the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said:  High-speed rail has the potential to bring considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
 We are therefore excited to be working in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating a win-win situation and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
 I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps. 
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the US move to relax regulations on electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in airplane mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it painful not being able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision that requires US carriers to do significant work to comply, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the immediate future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
 CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , she said.
The issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about its plans to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change but said it would follow the regulator.
 We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices as we really believe this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft , a spokesperson said.
Qantas stated that it was currently complying with the current rules.
 According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately, she said.
The FAA's decision applies to all US airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will be closely looking at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training material, hand luggage transport programmes and instructions provided to passengers.
 Once an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,  said the FAA.
In the rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be stored safely under seats or in upper compartments during takeoff and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people, according to the witnesses...
On this Halloween night, the party was heated on Pia's side where a brawl involving several people broke out on the Post Office side.
At least four minor injuries are reported.
The gendarmes, alerted, went to the scene to separate the combatants and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's mortgage lenders are taking advantage of middle-class people forced to tighten their belts
Janani Amirthalinga deposits a gold bracelet, ring and earrings with a pawnbroker in the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore to pay for her daughters' school fees.
 My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it, says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns Singapore $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is so high in parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  that ValueMax, where it completed its transaction, became the third mortgage company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelry pledging is not only a quick way to get Singaporean cash 1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga  but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's mortgage lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgage lenders as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to mortgage lenders to fill the gap as their economies slow.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly due to rising mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
 The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom of the [wage scale] are trying to supplement their income as much as they can , says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to pledge their personal belongings to get the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pawned in the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say,  the price of gold is high, let's pawn Grandma's gold necklace and we'll come back for it next month.
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The rise in the mortgage business is such that ValueMax, which operates the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other similar shops in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia  where it already has four shops  but also outside Asia, said its managing director, Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance them using 60 percent of the $66 million Singapore it raised this week at its Singapore IPO.
While some low-interest lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that mortgages not only offer lower rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
 Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt , she says.
The pledge is increasingly accepted as a means of securing guaranteed short-term financing.
Nor are people who go to pawn shops the only ones with financial problems.
Wealthy Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pawn shops to pledge gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can be up to 60 percent of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
 These may be wealthy people who need to borrow for short-term business or investment activities, or small businesses that need cash to make a difficult journey , adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money real fast.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth pastor in Halifax, Nova Scotia, is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor was a minister, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his position.
The pastor was released on parole.
In particular, they must not communicate with anyone under 18 and not use the Internet.
He's due in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes to the supermarket in Nazi uniform, then gets kicked out.
A man wearing a Nazi uniform with a swastika-crossed armband was asked to leave a British supermarket after customers complained to the supermarket management who called the police, the store said on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store", said a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police for help, but "by the time she arrived, he was already gone without a scandal", she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were dumbfounded.
"You don't go out like that unless you want to get attention", said Rosina Rusin, 60, a customer, to the Cambridge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, when it is customary to disguise oneself as a monster, but it was difficult to know whether it was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the attack on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for the past three years at Asda", said Paul Dutton, explaining that he had "mental problems".
Rescue plan of $325 million for Tasmania health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the faltering health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking  urgent measures  to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, high rates of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, which is for 4 years, was decided after consultations between the Government and the Independent Member of Parliament for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
 The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state, Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgeries.
An additional 2 600 operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help to make up the delay.
Funds are also available for free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved outpatient care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
 These investments are in line with the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health system, said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not mean much  unless followed by real reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system .
He nevertheless commended the government for responding to the urgent request for help he made to the Prime Minister in early May.
 I hope the federal aid plan will go a long way in removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist , said Mr Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "lucky solution".
 The reason we are here is because the state's Labor government has taken $430 million out of its health care system, he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government pulling almost half a billion dollars and the commonwealth putting in 300 million, and pretend it's a big day.
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout plan would be spent on additional red tape.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never gets lubricated or sensational, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says monitoring body
Syria has destroyed equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day ahead of the deadline for the
The Hague-based organization has adopted a resolution on 1 November ordering Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and for filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment will prevent Syria from producing new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, an estimated 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, including 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead are also estimated to be 2,202 deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people have been forced to flee the country as a result of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda networks, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting has highlighted the serious dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a continuing civil war within a short timeframe.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said that its team was  now satisfied that they had checked  and destroyed  all declared critical production and mixing and filling machines .
It added that  no further inspection activities were planned at the moment .
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria, abandoned and that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.
It was hard to tell at first glance if Safira's unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not allowed to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
 I salute the moral strength and courage you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization, said the organization's Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war pits mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, who are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
The head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a large explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger over the conviction of one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angrily to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Omar Patek should be shot by firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released on parole after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many others.
He was also convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
Prosecutors had asked for life imprisonment, but they could have asked for the man, called  Demolition Man  because of his reputation as an expert in bomb-making, to be sentenced to death.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin girls, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
She was on the verge of tears and said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have gone down the same path as the other men.
 He should be dragged before the firing squad , Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any more grandchildren, without seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the bombing and was unconscious for a month, and he died three times while on respiratory support.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have suffered the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre  Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra  who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been put to death first.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces would kill former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
 He did not surrender , added Mrs. Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed out loud at the pain he might have caused others.
The verdict came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be commemorated later this year with ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
There will be a lot of crying this year, Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can, however, appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music  but not talk on their mobile phones  under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes immediately.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and the rules on aircraft storage to comply.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
 Depending on the plan, we may approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon, the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They're not supposed to turn them back on until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices when descending from the aircraft before landing and not to turn them on again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoff, landing and grounding, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy about these changes.
 Once the new policy is safely implemented  and we will work closely with carriers for this  it will be beneficial to everyone , Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like  hall overseers  when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be required to turn their smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was nobly ejected from an American Airlines flight after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always need to be put away because they could hurt someone if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for cell phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said that cell phones were still considered a risk.
 Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board , Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to relax restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their mobile devices or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
The new airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and are FAA approved.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices are downloading or sending data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for easing of restrictions on passengers' use of electronic devices.
In 2011, company executives loaded a commercial airliner with Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired mixed feelings among the members of the FAA advisory committee about whether or not the use of the aircraft poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference from the aircraft was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only anecdotal reports from pilots that the devices could interfere with an aircraft's systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common sense arrangements for technology-enabled travelers.
 We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety , said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird helicoptered off a North Sea platform has been released into the wild
A bird, helicopter-trapped after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water slick was flown up in a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being rescued by the Scottish SPCA at their Alloa rescue centre.
The centre's director, Colin Seddon, said:  This water rattle was probably a winter migrant that came from northern Europe and was caught in the North Sea's strong winds. 
It seems that the exhausted bird managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added:  He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help. 
The water bug was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing business together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1000 business leaders, broadly representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues  ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws  most business leaders believe that control of these key competences should revert to Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread discontent, with businesses saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area  40% of large, traditionally more pro-European companies even agree.
Finally, and even more tellingly, our survey of business leaders found that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its efforts to change the Treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This finding, which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is pushing for  meaningful change  that will put the UK back on its feet.
The stakes are high  succeeding in changing the Treaty and better representing Britain's interests would see a swing of 16% in the vote in favour of the country remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubt: this survey shows that British businesses support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to UK hands.
It is possible and increasingly necessary to better represent the interests of British businesses as the euro area moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not waived the Halloween tradition.

Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgarian gas pipeline ushering in new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the head of Gazprom.
 A historic event took place today : Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project , Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream should diversify the export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, he adds.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated  forever .
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate once the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island is planning to create the world's largest marine reserve, reports the Tahiti News on Thursday, as reported by Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago in French Polynesia, is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
The territory is 47 square kilometres, including three small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by mutineers from the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English Navy that has led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live on Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95 percent of London's generosity.
The island council voted unanimously to establish a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which is 836,000 square kilometres in its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to grant this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be approved by the British Governor of Pitcairn, who is resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to protect these 836,000 km2 provided it had the means to monitor them, which it does not.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port for military surveillance ships.
France already has to conduct the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million square kilometres of the French Polynesian EEZ, which is adjacent to Pitcairn.
The FAA is relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft  but mobile phone calls will still be prohibited.

Former Chinese Vice Governor jailed for life
A former vice governor of Jilin Province in northeastern China was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Exiled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of taking more than 19 million yuan in bribes, state media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a state-owned institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's First Intermediate Court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing it to be a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
While the head of state promised that justice would be as unassailable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of former CCP leader Bo Xilai in Chongqing, who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest state officials.
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an agency independent of the party.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord during a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with child sexual abuse following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 during a Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse hearing.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it  had never had to deal with a problem of sexual abuse of children within its organisation .
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexually assaulting children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer with the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was unaware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by pointing out,  external audits of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization. 
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings out of four schools in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he failed to check that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum term of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings in child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including Lord being left alone with the children, keeping them in private, making them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said she found the head of children's services at the Caringbah YMCA, Jacqui Barnat, who mentored Lord  very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time .
The general manager said he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these failures to their superiors.
Instead, he said that their friendly relationship with Lord clouded their judgment, which is why they didn't report his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his view to the New South Wales YMCA Council that for the organisation the lesson learned from  the Jonathan Lord incident  should not concern  reporting  by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were brought up was made by the YMCA's chief children's services officer, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but that it was  overzealous  and was poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, to the Commission.
It indicated that there were  serious problems  in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20th.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but admits his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his views on various national policies known.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade at the helm, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair reportedly replied, according to the London Evening Standard:  Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so... 
When many experts in equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be fierce.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first arms, the toddler and his Shetland Toffee pony ran the three laps with great ease and won first prize, leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable  who are the same size  were praised for their appearance, attitude and style at the annual competition which was held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing up to men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap slightly sideways in a casual way to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural training qualities unusual for a child his age.
And Toffee got very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a birthday present last March and has been training with his Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee make a great duo".
They've been up against everyone, but both of them have taken the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he'd competed with Toffee and we were so excited he'd won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so amazing that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in horse racing for over 10 years.
Mrs Howells said:  There was electricity in the air and everyone cheered and applauded her. 
He ran the entire length of the track, and even though he seemed small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is an animal lover  he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens to care for.
The way he started, he'll probably be in the Horse of the Year contest soon  and I'm sure he'll do a great job.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said:  Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to ride his pony. 
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee were performing well and the way they marched on the track.
They're looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer  Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his nice clothes helped Fenton, he looked really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that made a call  will be renamed 
A Chinese newspaper that ran a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is to be renamed, a media regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a  complete overhaul , the regulator said.
The order for  remodeling  comes from the Guangdong Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several false stories about Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
 The New Express editorial staff was disorganized , the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.
It also  ordered Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it investigate the persons responsible at New Express and immediately overhaul the management team of the newspaper .
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a public television station where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
 In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust, he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several high-profile suspects recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are being systematically forced to confess, despite a change in law that was passed earlier this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is "unavailable"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in shambles.
The leakage of radioactive steam from one of the Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October while the ship was at sea was "safe for the seamen", but it is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal Navy has just confirmed that the ship is "not available" until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
The company DCNS, which specialises in naval defence, said its teams and those of Areva, which were sent to the Var for the occasion, were "currently working on the aircraft carrier".
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
"Everything is being done to ensure that the Charles de Gaulle can be deployed as planned at the end of 2013", DCNS said.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way call into question the activity program of the nuclear-powered ship".
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is coming out of a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had flown from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is particularly so as to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small malfunction" in the reactor containment area had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For over a year now, I have been able to see a lot of discontent from people everywhere I meet: monstrous revaluations of their properties, a deluge of taxes, the cost of all kinds of permits, endless administrative expenses.
In short, draining our pockets without limit.
Millions of dollars wasted could be saved to allow for a much more respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken from taxpayers by force diminishes their freedom to consume and contributes to their poverty.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, there is no shortage of lavish spending and maintenance of crippled ducks: a loss-making cultural center, a large subsidy to the City of Energy, and so on.
If these facilities are not profitable, they should be sold to the private sector or demolished.
It is also sad to see a number of properties being expropriated to accommodate a major industry that never came.
I do, however, make a very good point about the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?
It is not the public sector that should invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that the Fisheries and Piles lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the withdrawal of all industries (which are major consumers of water) and the great decline in population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without wasting it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly relaxed.
In short, it's very easy to do great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city can't even afford a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by tie-dye with pretty good degrees, most of them, and I don't think a sheep farmer does any worse.
Drug tunnel discovered between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated drug-trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation, and electrical rails, has been discovered.
U.S. officials described the 4-by-3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passageways they had ever seen.
The tunnel, which zigzagged along a length equivalent to nearly six football fields, connected warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is full of undefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide truckloads of drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were able to slip through, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men, who authorities say were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers are exploiting vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard-long railroad track that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a  surrender notice  against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual offences, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, seeking political asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard has  issued a surrender notice to a 40-year-old man asking him to report to a police station on a date and time of his choosing , a spokesman said.
He's still in violation of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the police's issuance of the notice.
Assange fears extradition from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after leaking more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting against classified information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to enter to access her smartphone or pay for her groceries?
Researchers in the United States, France and Japan predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors on phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a transversal and transnational universe such as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this craze for biometrics, but are concerned.
In 2011 alone, the French National Commission for Information and Freedom authorized 774 fingerprint, hand shape or hand vein recognition systems in companies, government, canteens, etc.
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere, anytime", says Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, D.C.
What is the reason for such optimism in some and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the vein network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
"For example, some concrete workers have severely damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible", says Philippe Robin, technical director of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and checking of the vein network and the contour of the hand requires a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a safety feature - you cannot capture this data without them knowing - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
With the increased accuracy of sensors and the computing power of computers needed for data analysis, these techniques are becoming operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold in the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automated border crossings using facial recognition.
Now it's possible to identify a face or an iris in motion.
"Today we are doing research on voice recognition or walking with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment", says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
The unique and unmistakable marker DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospects at the CNIL.
But DNA testing is still very time-consuming and very expensive.
NEC offers the police a suitcase that costs 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at a crime scene in an hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognizing a person from among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
Identification has so far been about issuing identity papers: biometric data (fingerprints, photographs, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already registered.
This helps to ensure that a person is not trying to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or shop.
"We retrieve the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them with the photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet", explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other uses include taking pictures of a quidam in line at a store, tracking its progress with facial recognition, and calculating waiting times.
Authentication was initially concerned with physical access (frontier, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, attendance control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a friend pointing for another", explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But increasingly, authentication will also include transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some ATMs by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in a store with a credit card, the customer does not type in a code, but inserts his finger into a scanner that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon be available to French traders.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If a customer stays in the checkout room for 30 seconds less because of biometrics, that's great", says the manager of a large store.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
Finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks if you try to move it", says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But because of the lack of detailed studies, it is impossible to know whether these discourses really convince users.
Privacy experts, on the other hand, continue to be concerned.
"The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr and Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance", predicts Andrew Patrick of the Privacy Commissioner's Office in Canada.
A driver driving at 210km/h with a hot drink between his legs was fined £1,000
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink between his legs.
At Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted to the offence of driving without due care and attention.
The seven points removed from his license led to a six-month license suspension.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign property owners to burst London's bubble
The Treasury has provisionally set the capital gains tax rate but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in Budget 2012 has included a 7% stamp duty on properties costing over £2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than as individuals.
Stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, which is more than the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and the Yorkshire and Humber region combined.
Mr Cook said:  Following the increase in stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system. 
 But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell , he added.
The high-end property market  the 5 to 10 per cent of the highest prices on the property market  in the thriving area of south-west London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 per cent last year.
Prices in central London are showing steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing domestic market, with the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have recently discovered how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.
Previous studies have found that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wagged their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said:  Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions. 
Here we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa in dogs, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs' disordered tail movements, researchers followed animals as they watched movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals' heart rates and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained:  We showed dogs films that featured other dogs  either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion  and we were able to manipulate the movement of the tail and present it as going more to the left or right. 
When the animals saw a dog without expression wagging its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they saw a tail that was veering mostly to the left (again from the dog's point of view wagging its tail), their heart rate sped up and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs deliberately communicated with one another through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not be concerned about.
He added:  If you encounter other dogs repeatedly and notice that most of the time, moving their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience.
The researchers say the findings could help pet owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their pets' emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Science at Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right handedness in a dog.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog and to the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific study done by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said:  Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious  the opposite of what was shown in the Italian study. 
He suggested that the differences might be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies did not fully view the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he said.
 Although there is a lot of evidence from different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified  and dogs are no exception , he said.
However, given how easily their behavior can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes move to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys are postponing a show in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness.
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band were due to perform at The Hydro concert hall in the city centre on Friday.
However, her laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the band were also forced to postpone a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said:  Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November. 
 Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert. 
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets are still valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for further assistance.
Pope Francis will name his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope  so this is up to a group of 120  cardinal electors .
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops would be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as a consistory.
 Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate planning for other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world, Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he wants to get the number of cardinals elected to 120 and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment there is a sort of tendency to favour Europe and particularly Italy.
 It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, he added.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with examining ways to reform the church.
Before, the pope made his own decisions.
 From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,  Valero explained.
He added that it was  quite possible  that Francis would seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced a situation like this before - it is totally new.
Valero said that popes generally elevate bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was  full of surprises  so we don't know who he will appoint .
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to fix the seat back.
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address a problem with manually tilting backs, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickup trucks, the front seats may have a faulty tilting mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
 If the vehicle is hit from behind, the headrest may not protect the occupants properly, increasing the risk of injury, according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The rollout of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the top US automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner's information letter due to a 16-day government shutdown, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The accident occurred at about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
It is likely that the foundation work had been going on for some time.
A nearby wall had just been built in the last days.
The accident happened when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve his tools.
"I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke", said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the site.
I came ashore and I went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
You could only see part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
Authorities say the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Emergency services attempted to resuscitate him but were unsuccessful.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The cry of despair from an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican Party obstructionism.
Obstructionism does not excuse the problems with the Obamacare website, nor the drone attacks.
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a horribly sad book these days.
It's a book I thought would encourage me through the gloom of my second year of medicine and give me hope again.
It's called  The Audacity to Win  and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' medical records at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and news anchors took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was marching on the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82 percent favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic days, they're like distant memories, a sad reminder of past opportunities.
The change really happened in the years since I first voted.
It was nothing like I imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from passing the Affordable Care Act to pulling our military out of Iraq, to ending the "never seen nor heard" and killing Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in immigration reform, public health care, and closing Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide an explanation.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, or drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
It cannot explain the National Security Agency's collection of data on Americans' private lives, or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funds and the overspending of authorized presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And, more recently, it can't excuse not being able to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is unpredictable, because the opposition political party and random events, like the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected to a second term, free from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we'd heard about for so long.
Yet while the positive opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me long for the many promises that have been swept away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting after the campaign, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay loyal to their cause.
 I want us to refocus on our talent , he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris alone.
On Friday, at about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The motorcyclist, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the quick response of the emergency services, he died in the head-on collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Congressman Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could get pregnant and take advantage of the system.
The mining tycoon, who is contesting the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has made this argument to try to deflect questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether to eliminate carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr Abbott's daughters were prepared to personally benefit from these policies.
 He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave,  said Mr Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.
Mr Palmer has proposed a re-engineering of the voting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
 We need a better system, he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can log in, enter your contact information into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it so you can cancel the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil and paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has been exploring possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new role  very seriously.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
 We are not looking for a reward, except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time , he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific missionary at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and the Environment (OCEAMM), talks to L'Express about the discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but it doesn't particularly surprise me.
Whereas in the past species were described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our scientific knowledge of species classification.
Indeed, it is not impossible that such advances in genetics and molecular biology will call into question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, family, or even order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are being challenged by advances in genetics.
Similarly, two closely related species have been distinguished by genetic analysis.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species of humpback whales: the Pacific humpback and the Atlantic humpback.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this a significant discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society has claimed?
From a conservation perspective, knowing these genetic differences is essential to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
While this population had been known to researchers for a long time, they didn't know it was part of a new species, found only in this area.
So if a problem of mass mortality from a viral outbreak or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a species that is more widely distributed on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered endangered or threatened based on the number of individuals present on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of its recovery from neighbouring stocks.
As for the Sousa chinensis, from which the newly discovered species originated, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it so rare to find new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there is a lot of genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
This genetic mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known.
We'd rather send robots to Mars than find out what lives in the Mariana Trench, just seven miles below the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than we do on marine research, and it's time for that to change.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources familiar with the matter, which once again shows that the global regulators' investigation into suspected currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is traded every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the broadening investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
 The ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators, a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources familiar with the case said RBS had passed on files of emails and instant messages sent to and by a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of spot foreign exchange trading at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these merchants were charged with any crime.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources familiar with the file added.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities  the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are investigating allegations that bankers have colluded to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks are sifting through instant messages and emails sent over the years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News of these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers for investment bank trading units in recent years but has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the issue by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasing use of banks of their own internal platforms  explains that it is possible to start making an impact on the market at low cost .
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after he caused a $6 million loss late last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
 We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was brought under control, said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been a bust, says a lawyer
After police confirmed they had obtained a copy of the video that allegedly showed Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation "as sloppy".
Ruby told the Canadian Press that she believes police "ignored or downplayed" evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously charged with drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police also said they saw the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Mr Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his phone, claiming that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to take action against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions at their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
She could also have requested an instant search warrant if deemed necessary.
The police chief declined to comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ms. Ruby's remarks "a clear and desperate attempt" to assert himself to the media in a case that had nothing to do with him.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for filing criminal charges against the mayor.
European stock markets down in mid-month, except for London
With the exception of London, the major European stock markets were down on Friday in the middle of the trading day, driven by some disappointing company news, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve may unwind its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of inflation of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) might ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures are predicting a reopening of U.S. stocks, after two consecutive sessions of declines.
In terms of values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline in the CAC 40, driven by the earnings warning from its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) is the worst performer in the EuroFirst300, having also posted lower results this morning and announced the creation of an in-house bad bank structure with £38bn of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) remained at the top of the EuroFirst300 in response to press reports that AT&T was considering a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the ECB's monetary policy is on the rise, as John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank, points out.
The ECB's single mandate has always been about inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continued its decline against the US currency and reached a two-week low of $1.3517 in the session.
The same assumptions support the euro area bond market.
The Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care reform bill
Big victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court today declared the health care reform law ratified by Obama to be constitutional.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the judges upheld the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , which requires citizens to have health insurance by 2014, or face a fine , and declared it constitutional under the government's power to impose taxes.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also upheld the other sections of the 2,700-page law and further held that the provision of the Health Care Reform Act, which states that the threshold for eligibility for Medicaid must be lowered or lose all federal funding for the program, was constitutionally coercive.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primary, including the nominee Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic organizations, paid tribute to the soldiers and fallen in all wars on Friday afternoon.
Sheaves were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Clashes between Palestinians and Israelis at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were injured on Thursday evening in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the deadliest incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday after running out of fuel, the Palestinian Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another senior Hamas military branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shelling during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, local medical sources said.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on Palestinian tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a 100-meter incursion into the territory before retreating.
The confrontation lasted for half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said Israeli soldiers had been killed in the clash.
Hamas congratulates the al-Qassam heroes who fell defending the territory during a Zionist occupation raid on Khan Younes.
Several enemy were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas insists that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier", the spokesman threatened.
The Israeli army said that the initial target of the operation was a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, which was discovered on October 7 and which the army said was intended for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the tunnels were used to fight Israel, saying the purpose was to kidnap Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device aimed at IDF (Israeli army) forces and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks on Israeli civilians", said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a missile shipment destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday.
A US official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but gave no details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah", he added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" it did not name, the Saudi-owned chain said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard early Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jable, near Latakia on the Syrian coast.
The organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, had been unable to identify the source of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Danse Danse: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies by Satie.
An evening that shows the whole of Chouinard's prism, from art to tics and from black to white.
A white screen serves as the back wall.
On the white carpet in the vast space of the Maisonneuve, a body, thin as a line and dressed in black, advances.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes shape.
And this will be the shape of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, all dressed in black, only their hands and faces uncovered, wait on either side of the playing field, rush in when the next graph appears, embody it, run out.
This black and white play by Henri Michaux is performed in solo relay, in unison group (a mass that does solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, as a soloist, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on signs, placed in a line in the foreground.
It's the same principle, but a giant PowerPoint version.
The music is loud here, drums and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monochord and monotone in the cry, and continues dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This loud, energetic, if long, discharge eventually deafens and numbs.
So does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - image creation has always been a strength in Chouinard - like those hair that blur or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has won with her tics.
The result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider and more glib imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the ending, in the negative, with its dancers chopped by strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches on the magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
Gymnastics, after the interchange, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in gray, the dancers and the piano are covered with cloth, like furniture in an abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their musical clumsiness, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, couples perform in love duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transitional solos, moving ensembles, choirs, the writing is less binary.
Clowns, also familiar to Chouinard, show off their red noses in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Love is either a butcher, a fugitive or a gambler.
The gestures, the laughter and the little screams beautifully translate the archaic, grace and ridicule of coitus bodies, of the beings that merge.
But the play takes off after the rescue.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers shuffle, descend among the spectators, glow, smoke, short circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are sweating, and it is Chouinard's art here to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of Nortel's old patents began a spate of patent lawsuits Thursday against cell phone makers, including Google, the company it hailed at the patent auction that followed Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies in the United States District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in relation to search terms on the Internet, the court findings said, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which provides fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal based in part on Motorola's patent library.
 Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patent in question at auction, it has violated and continues to violate the patent , the court findings said.
Rockstar is seeking greater damages against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is persistent, according to the plaintiff.
Explosion in Gesves: faulty water heater caused explosion
The grandmother lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion in a house in Gesves, which left two seriously injured on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, said Friday evening the deputy prosecutor of the King.
The expert sent by the prosecutor's office says the explosion was purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
Both victims' vital signs are still in.
The grandmother was thrown out by the explosion and is badly burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was next to him and was slightly burned.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she in a helicopter, he in an ambulance", said the mayor José Paulet, who went to the scene.
The traumatized grandfather was upstairs when the explosion occurred.
He was able to climb safely up the stairs, which were intact, while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, which was damaged by the explosion, were relocated by the CPAS president.
Andenne and Namur firefighters and the Arches police responded.
Crisnea's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to be sworn in
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a new Egypt when he took the oath of office as president, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
When he was sworn in by the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the Court whose building on the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
 We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic , President Morsi said during the ceremony broadcast live on state television.
 Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life  absolute freedom, true democracy and stability , said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been considered an illegal organization for more than 84 years since its formation and severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential glory of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the  spare wheel  uncharismatic of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started in the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
 Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state , Mohamed Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, said, addressing the judges in the wooded hall where he took the oath.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was greeted by the song  The people and the army, hand in hand...  sung by thousands of people gathered in the university's grand amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and once a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, had stripped him of.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office in the courtroom, rather than in Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army, showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The US shutdown has slowed the car market's rise
The 16-day shutdown of most federal government offices weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, figures released Friday by automakers showed, with five of the six largest performing below expectations.
Detroit's three largest automakers are showing double-digit growth from October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts had expected an average of 15.4 million sales in annualized and seasonally adjusted terms but the market was 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that the slight slowdown is primarily due to "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month".
GM nevertheless reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to the 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The four brands of the group have improved their commercial performance compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickup trucks, saw sales increase by 14% year on year to 191 985 vehicles, compared with the consensus expectation of 194 301.
Fiat-controlled Chrysler, meanwhile, reported an 11 percent increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also reported sales below the consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM stock was up 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford was down 1.1%.
Renault plunged to the stock market by Nissan's warning
Renault reported its biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor said it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20 percent, traders reported.
Nissan, which had to make such a review, also announced a change in its management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning", says a trading manager at a Paris brokerage.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French one, according to data on Nissan's website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near neo-Nazi party building
Two people were killed and another seriously injured Friday night by gunfire from two people on a motorcycle as it passed a Golden Dawn party venue in the western suburbs of Athens, police sources said.
Police were not able to provide information on the victims' identities and possible political affiliations at this time.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards from their local bar.
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital, according to the same source.
Police from the anti-terrorism department rushed to the central avenue of the Neue Iraklio suburb where the incident took place and surrounded the area.
The incident comes weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party's leader and founder, were charged with being part of a "criminal organisation" in an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal denied
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has been denied his appeal and will be suspended for his club's next two Champions League games against Ajax and AC Milan.
Ejected from the match against Barca for hitting Neymar, the Scottish midfielder was suspended for three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed" and that his appeal was fully justified.
Almost 50,000 homes across the province were without power shortly after noon Friday as strong winds hit many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected areas are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8,642.
The Greater Montreal area is also experiencing its share of blackouts with almost 7,000 homes without electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Center seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised up its net profit forecast and is hoping for record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the full year of between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8% profit in the first half and had started the second half strong, particularly in non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
 Since the beginning of the year, all 10 countries in which we operate have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record full-year earnings before interest and taxes, he said.
This is particularly true of Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, the leisure travel sector of Flight Centre performed well while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was weaker and was expected to turn a profit for the year as a whole for the third consecutive year.
Flight Center's stock went up 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown gunmen shoot at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unidentified masked gunmen opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt, leaving no casualties, apparently as a result of a dispute with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said Interior Ministry spokesman Police General Abdel Latif.
The attack comes as Egypt has seen almost no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and has cracked down on protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar
As part of the English Literature course, students will be required to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British work of fiction from 1914 to the present.
The review will also present  new texts  to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to take an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English Literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math curricula tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the examination regulator, will unveil a re-structuring of GCSE, with a new grading system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Education Minister, said there was  broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , stressing that GCSEs would be  more challenging, ambitious and rigorous .
Studies show that English schools spend less time in maths - 116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year - than most other countries.
In comparison, schools in Australia provide an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore provide about 138.
Although there is no formal requirement to spend more hours of school time on maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the in-depth GCSE in maths  as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings  would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of lessons.
The programme will place more emphasis on  real world problems , particularly financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that state that largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
An 80-year-old man greets kids with a gun at the Muy for Halloween
The miners, ages 9 and 13, went from door to door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The 86-year-old man told the police that he was afraid.
His gun was confiscated.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without a trace, was in fact buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says Professor Johannes Tuchel, head of the German Resistance Memorial, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte", he told the widely circulated daily newspaper, citing archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would answer one of the great puzzles of the postwar period.
The German secret service, the BND, said that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a makeshift grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando", according to Tuchel.
He was wearing a "general's uniform".
"In the left inner pocket were his service records and a photograph", he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council of the Mitte district in Berlin stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
For one of the most brutal Nazi sadists to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is in the worst taste.
"The memory of the victims is being brutally trampled on", he wrote in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the few important figures in the Third Reich who was never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "Final Solution" and had Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Pamela Anderson is cutting her iconic blonde curls and adopting a spectacular boy's haircut.
Pamela's blonde curls became famous through her role in the sexy TV series Malibu Alert.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock her fans with a spectacular new hairstyle.
The former hottie from Alert in Malibu dropped her long blonde hair against a platinum blonde boy's haircut.
The 46-year-old actress unveiled her new look as she strolled through L.A. on Wednesday and shared a photo on her Twitter page.
This is the first time in 20 years that the pretty blonde has had her hair cut, and we're all fans of the subtle change.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free healthcare in Cameroon villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely one for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to be voted CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate between periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visit hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would plague him for the rest of his life.
 There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, getting him any treatment he could get.
 It is not easy, adds Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be first, and you're not first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation hasn't changed much since Dr Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In comparison, the United States has 1 doctor for every 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of every five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health expenditure is in the private sector.
 The only problem they have is poverty, explained Dr Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 free surgeries in the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a nonprofit humanitarian organization, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, about 30 people, having attached the medical equipment to the roof, crowd into vans and cross difficult terrain to reach the villages where help is most needed.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
They had to push the vehicles over muddy roads and rivers many times.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: the community throws a party, sings and dances, and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free healthcare is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr Bwelle  with his big smile and energy  is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team starts seeing hundreds of patients.
 We receive 500 people at each visit, Bwelle said.
Sometimes they live 60 kilometers from the village, and they walk.
This traveling hospital provides a variety of health care services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, collected glasses or a free birth certificate  a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, town hall, or home; after the procedure, the patient stands up and goes to the recovery room to give his place to the next person.
By using the lighting of the generator, the operating room, and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a tiring pace, but the musicians in the villages usually help the team stay motivated.
 They beat drums all night to keep us awake so we can continue working , Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to town tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their presence can make a difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would enable him to work again.
 This will change my future and that of my family, said the man.
In addition to running this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
He explains that this second job is where 60 per cent of his association's funding comes from; the rest is covered by private donations.
 I don't know when he sleeps , said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to raise money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a field-learning opportunity they don't have at home.
 We were able to participate in operations to help with blood sponging or to get the instruments through to Dr Bwelle , Ms O'Malley explained.
It's not something you get to do in America when you're a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical supplies collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
 He is a hero, there is no doubt , said Katie O'Malley.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not about to die.
For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happy lives in fulfillment of the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
 I am so happy when I do this job, added Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons I do this.

The two France by Pierre Nora
In perplexity, scholars have long struggled to define and locate Peter Nora.
Teacher in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but by highlighting his weakness for cross paths, Sciences-Po, higher education.
Arbitrator of other people's works in his office on Rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Yes, but ignoring the hidden work and the underlying writing of the publisher.
Heir to Fontenelle's chair at the French Academy?
Yes, but he knows that such an ordination cannot replace the true holy oil, the one of the thesis he made.
They readily recognized him as a great awakener, animator and organizer of their works, but observing that he was unwilling to produce any himself.
The monument to which he gave his name, the "Loces of Memory", also contributed to this uncertain image.
The bad languages may have seen it as a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and a heavy academic load, but an incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the man who was supposed to be a non-writer had written a lot and well.
This book should do him justice once and for all.
Yet, once again, the temptation to be ubiquitous, to wander intellectually, to jump from one subject to another.
But it is easy to see that the disparate objects collected in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one passion: that of discovering the constitutive knot of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: it is a concern of the times.
We have been asked to define it collectively recently.
But in the peremptory mind of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
The only thing left to do was to deploy the accidents, and the matter, as Jacobinism required, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Peter Nora is after is a very different one.
He does not claim to be the heir of eternal frankness, he refuses to be defined.
An analyst, worried about a familiar strangeness, wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a puzzle-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
The question arises from the enterprise itself: why, in a country so firmly established within its borders, so anciently structured and solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, only to ward off the turmoil of France's discordant history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most iconic, of course, is the one that splits national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have had two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but could not deny it; on the contrary, she was anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility that she had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity felt, nothing beats the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France both made a revolution, wrote a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American sewing only enhances what is unique to us.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men crammed with an old native regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensus revolution, but here it has sown drama and conflict.
There are the founding fathers who are always honored, and here are the revolutionary ancestors who are hardly a role model, and who have killed each other.
There is institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as well as many mistakes to catch up and attempts to repeat.
France is leaving, France is coming
There was a time, though, when the French thought they could sew back the torn dress of their history, and break the curse of the number two.
Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness for this central and creative moment of the Third Republic: he greeted those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity was short-lived.
It is again being debated, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of minority claims, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France as it goes and the careful sketch of France as it comes.
And as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should be a surprise.
We find out that the chimney was a homemade one.
The man of multiple curiosities was spinning, slightly obsessed, around the same idea.
The edge patrol was standing in the center of the center.
And the man who submitted a paper on the idea of a nation more than half a century ago but who avoided the initial exercise of the thesis, confides in us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually do it.
But in a less rigid, more fractured and subtle form.
But let's not get it wrong, it's just as binding.
Because far more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: 'Return is quite complex to manage'
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" crew who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hostages of the World" in 2004, which he has chaired for several years.
Its main purpose is to provide the hostages with the opportunity to lodge a complaint and bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
After more than 1,000 days in detention, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they were able to reunite with their families.
And try to get back to their normal lives.
The newspaper "Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former journalist, retired in 2008, president of the association "Hostages du monde".
From the night of your release, you were on the 8 o'clock set of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In Beirut, for example.
When I was released, I found myself in the trunk of a car where I met - without seeing him because it was dark - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're free, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but also very tense.
It's war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They drop us off on the sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Next we arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
We're being taken to the French embassy by Frenchmen.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night of talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means of evacuating to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We arrive by helicopter, board a private plane and fly back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boarded.
How did your arrival on French soil go?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little rough.
There's an incredible hustle.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three TV stations.
I come back and there's a lot of them.
Coming down the flight deck, meeting my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles followed our car, which Roussin was driving.
The bikers are working their asses off to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little policing to keep some of them from getting on.
The media pressure is enormous.
It's not stopping. We're in a good position to know.
But the emotional state and fatigue is so great that it's hard to see clearly.
You come out of a hole and suddenly you're in the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hard part.
I'm on the 8 o'clock show the next day.
Then you start some sort of rehab, very slowly, for a month or two that's kind of like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had my first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce in the days following my return: X-rays, examinations of all kinds and a meeting with a psychiatrist.
It's not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on it, remember it if we need to, that we're not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage takers.
It was logical.
I didn't mind.
How do you feel about the release of the four hostages from Niger today?
I'm listening to what's going on.
The ransom debate, for example.
Some things annoy me, some things don't.
I'm trying to sort things out between questions about my past as a hostage and my cap as president of the Hostages of the World Association which allows me to put some distance between myself and finds it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem here.
Hostage-taking must be described as a 'political' hostage-taking - which it is most of the time - and hostages must be given access to justice, to lodge complaints and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in sympathy, in emotion, and rejoicing at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might have access to justice, too?
A court in The Hague is for that.
Why don't we tell the hostage takers, "You have violated the rules of war, like all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me to be well founded, legitimate, common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the streets to denounce Morsi trial
Anger is roaring in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi began, they took to the streets.
A nationwide demonstration demanding the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, the Muslim Brotherhood activist points out.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to get a copy of the case documents.
This isn't a trial, this is a prank.
President Morsi's trial is a fake trial if a pro-Morsi woman comes forward, he is supposed to put Sisi on trial, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacre, the Nahda massacre, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine states of violating gay rights
Since the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, "all spouses of military personnel have the right to a Department of Defense ID card and the benefits that come with it", the minister said in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League in New York.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he said, accusing those states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social and health services provided in these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that federal law is enforced.
The nine-state fray began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard installations, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on gay marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior Defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of gay marriage at about 5,600 active-duty personnel, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retired.
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration will be open on Saturday morning from 9am and qualifying will begin at 10am before the final at 3pm and the awards ceremony at 4pm.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, are already competing at the highest level, such as the young heroic prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place at this year's European Championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing better than to show off to competitors three heads ahead of him.
Toronto Mayor is chasing reporters away from a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of using drugs, according to several media reports.
A video filed with the police seems to support these suspicions.
The suspect, Rob Ford, has always denied using crack, but admitted to having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes images don't need explanation or commentary.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, although France has been free of native cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and he died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and treat people who may have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October inclusive", the ministries of health and agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, preventive treatment of rabies, given after contact with the infected animal but before symptoms appear, is very effective", the report says.
The Ministries are now calling on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on mucous membranes or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10am and 6pm from 1 November.
"As France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother was imported from another country, not free", the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "indigenous" case of rabies was in December 1998 in a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)".
A case of rabies was reported in 2008 in a dog illegally imported from The Gambia.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time", the ministry warns, and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backs off on health care reform
Amid a flood of criticism, President Obama yesterday reversed his unequivocal and often repeated promise that  if you're happy with your health plan, you can keep it.
After hundreds of thousands of people received notice of termination from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days, accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
 The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it, he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls a "news bubble" about the termination of insurance, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to look for new insurance in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-adapted health plans for the same price or even for less than expected.
You'll come out of it a winner, he said.
The administration announced that it should come as no surprise if the 5% of the population who take out their own insurance are forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
 Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better , said Kathleen Sebelius in her testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed  regrettably .
 I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else, she added.
I can't wait to earn your trust again.
That was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who said that, thinking her microphone was off, to an aide sitting behind her at the House of Representatives yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative from Missouri, about whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Mrs. Sebelius why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to sign up for a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now sells to millions of Americans.
Vettel is wearing a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the German car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at track level.
Four-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel wore a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for the free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday.
Vettel selected from 1,500 designs submitted from around the world in a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his team.
He was invited to watch the Abu Dhabi GP with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday at practice.
It's likely he'll have another special helmet on Sunday for the race, which is destined to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the Suburbs
Let's not get carried away.
In the mind of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the Suburbs" is not just for the suburbanites.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he explains.
When I say suburbia, I mean all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented at a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers on Thursday, was born of a desire to better defend multiculturalism, the great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighbourhoods above all.
My number one proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorial attaché, now claims to be "100 percent apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
He was a member of the French Socialist Party (PSOE) from 2002 to 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left but if people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too, he continued.
I only speak to extremist parties.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme - which can be consulted on the Internet - on many topics that are supposed to speak to the residents of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building guard ...
He said that the candidates needed to be found to form lists and to defend their ideas on the political scene.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the Suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven heads of list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the emails of support I've been receiving since yesterday aren't all from the suburbs", he rejoices.
John Kerry has admitted, in an unprecedented way, that American espionage  has gone too far in an inappropriate way 
John Kerry indicated a softening of the US defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedently, that on several occasions, the spying  had gone too far in inappropriate ways .
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on  autopilot  when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came to light.
The leaks have put the U.S. government in the middle of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said:  It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned some things on autopilot because we had the opportunity to, from the Second World War and through the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on September 11. 
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had gone too far, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said:  In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way. 
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel misled.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added:  We live in a new world where people are ready to get blown up. 
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we have been able to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the US, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats they made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
 It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain by our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism, Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term and chairman of the US Senate European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA intercepted millions of communications in Europe, which damaged relations with some of the US allies, however the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations included documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the cell phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state.
Director of Intelligence James Clapper justified Allied spying by saying that it was necessary and was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be announced in the coming days.
He said the route was still to be determined.
Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to allow for improved relations, but also to show  loving firmness .
He said European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the kind of spy programs they themselves had been running for years.
 We can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing spying, Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the anger over US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed lower on Thursday, hit by Shell's poor performance and a day after the Fed announced it would continue to support the economy as planned.
Australian woman appeals her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of making false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were controlling her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
She was held in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Office to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was  extremely concerned  about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
 We obviously had a stressful time, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible, said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press reported that she was on holiday in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years in prison and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand may also seek to repair its deteriorated image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht fans who come with other than RSCA buses
The French police have decided to impose strict rules regarding the match between the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht and Paris Saint-Germain scheduled for Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, spokeswoman for the Brussels-Midday police area, said on Friday.
Belgian RSCA fans who wish to attend this Champions League match will have to use the travel system put in place by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium", the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same on the way back.
"If other supporters were planning to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has informed that measures have been taken to allow for arrests and even guards in sight", Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French: the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This prompted a year ago a consultation with parents, pupils, teachers and education staff to consider ways of better integrating students who live in cross-cultural situations.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The organisation Vision diversité has been walking through schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common ground that is not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they were native or foreign.
Who are our builders?
"So we design projects so that they can relate to all this", explains Aïda Kamar, president of Vision Diversity.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school board.
"For example, the transmission of Québec culture, the sense of belonging, the support of staff in the changes that are taking place among the student clientele", he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has set up a research centre to provide teachers with tools, who sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different teaching strategies are the real need", she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, educational, social and cultural.
