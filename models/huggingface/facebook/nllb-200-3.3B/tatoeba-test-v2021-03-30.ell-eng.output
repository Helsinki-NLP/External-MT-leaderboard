You are not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My partner and I are in the same line of work, but he's been promised a promotion very soon.

Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You are Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell him I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
That's right.
We are honest.
I woke up at five.
Tell them we'll be ready.

Just a minute, please.
I can't forget her smile.
I'm going home today.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in town.
I've had a rough year.

They'll catch us.
Shut up!
Just give me some time.
The speech stole my heart.

Tell them to come home.
Take them with you.
I'd like to see it.

Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes on the test.
Tom will cook.
I was scared.
It's better to teach a man how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I see.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.
I'm at a friend's house.
Have you slept at all?
I thought it was a bad dream.
We know what the problem is.
It just seems unfair.
I'm Mexican, speak fluent Spanish.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I need your help.
Tom wanted me to learn French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.
You speak Spanish?
You are weak.
Where 's the paper ?
He walked home.
Tom will cry.
Where does he live?
When will you come?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready ?
Tell them not to come.
It's not expensive.
The knife on the table wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my knife.
Is that your car?
I kissed her.

Why are we poor?
Tom is naked from the waist up.
I hope they find Tom.
I'll expect you at two.
Bring them with you.
Give me your money.
What can you say in English?

It's not my fault.
Can you answer that?
I have to be there before seven.

"What do you want to know?" "Everything".
Tom insisted on helping Mary.

I didn't think it would be so easy to do.
Just wait a minute.
Tom will catch Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that tall building.
The town has changed a lot since then.
These are our guys.
Our team has good players.
I always put my team first.
I have many friends who live in Boston.
That's not a fish.
Emilia's doing her homework.
I like that kind of music.

Tom is very slow.
How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When is your birthday ?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you pressed that last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one is coming.
If you're busy, I can help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend is here.
I'm thirty years old.
How was the beach?
You're Tom's daughters, right?
Tom drank a glass of wine.
I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
Tom put on his gloves.
She's very curious.
I like China.
Tom is smoking.
I'll never be as rich as Tom.
You're not a dog.
Do you like white wine?
It's going to rain tomorrow.
I just said a really stupid thing.
The house collapsed.
Put the book on the desk.
Can I see your birth certificate?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
Do you eat meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I know what you mean.
If you'll follow me, please.
He started talking to the dog.
They all ran out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's pointless.
Tell them it's important. They'll know.
The party's on Sunday.
We're all Canadians here.
Listen to the snoring.
Did Tom send you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How do you pronounce that word?
He saved me.
I have an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get yourself drunk.
I'm expecting your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it ? What is it ?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has dark circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game ?
I just finished bathing.
We're not changing anything.
Look what I did!
Tom is a Harvard graduate.
You have 30 days.
Tom bought Mary a small gift.
Russian is a Slavic language, spoken as a native language in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and widely used, though without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries that were republics of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm older than her.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm twenty-three".
Boil some water.
I wish I was born Canadian.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
We've identified them.
They were burning enough candles.

Did you see who did it?
We're not millionaires, you know.
Let's thank them.
You'll see the difference.
Don't tell Tom about the party.
I don't know why Tom isn't here.
He never forgets his money.
He's almost 20.
You have to stay.
I didn't vote for you.
Are you mad at Tom?
My parents live a carefree life in the country.
He lost all his money in the casino.
I love the green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good look.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Thomas has cursed me.
We're very busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your order the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it ?
They killed her.
My car is dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
We don't know where Tom went.
Who's the boss now?
I'm with child.
Can you teach me some Gaulish?
I'll show you how it works.
What did you tell her about us ?
These are our kids.
Dick tried in vain to solve this problem.
I'm not Italian.
I want to kiss Tom.
The text is incomprehensible.
We need more volunteers.
You're stronger than them.
Tom painted his room white.
The flying squirrel came flying down from the tree.
Tom says he's hungry.
I don't live in Boston. I know.
Whose dog is that?
Tom waited for Mary for at least an hour.
Most of them are Canadians.
You're cooking now.
Are you sure Tom can do this?
Are you sure you don't remember?

Who is Tom talking to?
- What?
Do you speak Japanese?
Stop being so mean.
You speak my language ?

Tom likes gardening.
Tell her all about it.

The rumor is not true.
Move a chair.
Only you can save me.

What's Tom going to bring?
The novel has been translated into many languages.
Tom must be over 30.
Help me get him up.
Tell them I'm ready.
You ready for tonight?
It seems to me you should be able to do this yourself.
Count your leftovers.
Why didn't you come?
Could you teach me your language?
I came home empty-handed.
I couldn't agree more.
