Barack Obama is the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway for 26 hours, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northwestern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple will meet with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates with the ceremony at which Obama receives the prestigious prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when taking over the prize.
The president does not want to escape this topic because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He has reinforced the war efforts a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which no one of his critics forgets to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the golden medal, the diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charities, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charity.
The event program then includes a banquet with the president and his wife, at which, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the prime minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama has been very discreet about the price from the beginning.
For example, he pointed out that he felt he didn’t deserve the prize entirely.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for everyone who aspires to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he noted that it was a “call to action” for him.
Conservatives accused of blackmail
The police in Leitmeritz accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases last year he appealed against some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said Alena Romova, spokeswoman for the police.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in jail and is facing a prison sentence of up to three years.
The garbage containers in Brunei do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the sorting garbage containers.
And in Brunei?
There you will have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tanks.
I do not want to argue that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors do not care enough about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the republic.
Brno is in the waste separation race in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here can always dump only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of tonnes of garbage for such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Moroccan Square opposite the Affected Goats.
Mr Onderka should not annoy us his colleagues, but that seems to me too little.
Apart from that, the separation of waste is also not a honeyflake in other parts.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
of laziness .
They are too far away from the garbage.
I am not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street I did not see any coloured garbage tones in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place on the road.
The rubbish almost passed.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?
However, ecology and some sort of aesthetics will probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They would rather buy the city an ice hockey league that is embarrassing to us throughout the republic, rather than buying a few more rubbish tons and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption even with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brunei is really the worst in the whole district of Southern Morocco.
The "Paroubek" budget withdrew the money for pensions and sickness payments
After the left party, despite the view of the government, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness pay and construction savings business.
But neither for state debt interests nor for international legal disputes.
This creates even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed wage increases for some groups, they expected the government to subsidize the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sickness allowance.
Loans are apparently paying higher interest rates, and one has to repay the money at some point.
Too many to choose where to take, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
Later for their children too.
To get the pensions or the sick money, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get that money.
But at the cost that the state is indebted even more – next year, not only will there be a shortage of 163 billion in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster, along with the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to raise VAT only slightly or to cut maternity allowance, as the government did in its counterdeficit package.
Due to the deflation of money in favor of some electoral groups, there will also be a lack of five billion for the expansion of highways and railways next year.
These are mostly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly re-approved.
Mostly get what is not free.
This means the delay or closure of thirty large buildings, the money-making of Europe is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transportation, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it trigger the outflow of money salomonically – it attacks the CEZ shareholders, in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion euros went to the budget.
Each year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent of GDP, according to EU rules.
But this is not the end of the carnival of turmoil.
Nearly three billion were cut in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for legal disputes, even for construction savings.
Whether the state will survive without that money is uncertain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international litigation, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota said.
The minister must then save the money within the district or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already started two-billion-dollar project "State Treasury", which should enable online monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first phase starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future a phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The proposed plans look promising.
It is enough to just press one button, and out of Windows Mobile will be in the shift Android within a few seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was shown for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented to journalists the smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which the aforementioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to come to customers in 2012.
Snowfall in the mountains plagues hotel owners
Scene-free slopes do not only concern the inhabitants of giant mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to bind.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if, in our opinion, this year’s Christmas will be on snow or “on scratch,” said Spindl.Info’s operator Martin Jandura.
Those who want the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to their expectations should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer savings and where the quality of the stay comes only second, who can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year’s Day.
I think they’ll try to sell them for a while, but then they’ll have to give up and go for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter dates are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
Approximately half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free seats here.
Good sales are also found in the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the weekend in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, Schiefert says.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about 5% better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80% of New Year's Eve stay is also occupied by the Hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds are still free.
We were pleasantly surprised this year in January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
In the meantime, February is a little weaker, but in the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains is also increasing, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the hotel owners of the Giant Mountains are waiting for greater snow protection.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But then there will be another warming, Jiri Jakubsky from the Czech Weather Agency in Hradec Kralove told reporters.
Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost strange with what student ambition Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he considered the stupidest.
When he eventually swept out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it off on the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario for three years.
Not only has he repeatedly used the phrase “as in Iraq” in the text himself, he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: “New Way Forward” without hesitation.
Three years ago, he even criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh troops to Iraq plagued by the civil war as a “irresponsible and in its consequences catastrophic decision.”
But the following months showed that the Bush strategy based on recommendations from the military was the only possible and very successful, so that today there is no talk about Iraq in the news.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, as he objectively left his successor in a much more grateful starting position than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will repeat itself.
To increase the contingent of troops, he was once again asked by the military, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the habits of subordination harshly criticized the roaring shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 troops to reverse the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he deceived General Wenistens with 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pushed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself initially expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years.
Some have doubts that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders respect the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain merely fictitious structures behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially due to the ambiguity of the circumstances that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
Even the construction of a "active state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is very unrealistic.
Time Horizon of Obama's Strategy Strangled by His Voluntaryism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who broke out in the cry of war about the "early return" can do a miracle here can only a truly romantic soul, not impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as an indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindukush suburbs.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the heightened sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question arises for the United States, whether the problem can not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America moves to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan after Obama.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turning point in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
This was announced by the company, which responded to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money, but they can only sell them in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is aware of the further direction it has to go, Douglas Elliott, a former banker at JPMorgan, said.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting aside $17 billion in premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses during this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-time tax of 50 percent on bankers’ bonuses exceeding £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines except physics.
Five record women have received this year’s Nobel Prizes in literature and literature from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their countryman Jack Szostak for their research in the chromosome field.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israeli scientist Ada Jonath, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their research on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American economist Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for their analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman won a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
This prize was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for their research in the field of fiberglass and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these laureates received the diploma, the Nobel medals and a certificate of the acquisition of the prize.
It is worth 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the prize will be divided between them.
US President Barack Obama has traditionally received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and, moreover, he is at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the achievement of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation; Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives Finance Minister Eduard Janota early on Friday, who is considering his stay in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form released by the parliamentary assembly on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and Janota’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the government deficit is too high, which also deepens the public finance crisis.
About the meeting informed the President’s spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
Parliament voted on Wednesday on the left-wing proposals to turn money and raise the money for public official salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Therefore, between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen, and therefore the question mark is raised about the further work of the Fischer Cabinet, on whose formation the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fisherman’s government in the autumn, and which, in their understanding, is meant to end public debt.
Klaus, who can, but does not have to, sign the law on the state budget, said today at a discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem", which represents the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
I think there is no good solution anymore.
Improvement could only be achieved by a strong government, which could build on a broader consensus among political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek pointed out that the budget is awful, and the government should consider its further existence.
ODS Vice Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek's words that the state deficit is awful that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world a lot of the country, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relationships and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the Oscar-winning American actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, “If I’m going to play you, I’ll have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", already portrayed the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave-holder, a fictional U.S. President, Dar and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African citizen was jailed for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke.
The film depicts a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country.The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can reconcile his people through sport, so he decides to reconcile the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team eventually climbed to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in a way to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is being transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to become another person.
Matt Damon in the film portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I ringed the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie I look much bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of Eastwood's "Invictus: Unbeaten" and there is also talk of prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the following words: "It was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light mystery over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
Over Norway, a special light effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, again failed and the missile called the Bulava type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on the ground during the missile tests had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not launched at all or has been damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers have already described Bulava as a “missile that does not fly.”
A rocket that does not fly but lights
The 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
At the end of the flight, there was also technical damage to the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which flew under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over the North Path caused by an indefinite flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians did not doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generality has resisted this time, claiming that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Although no test launch was made without error, the Defense Ministry’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The fifty-percent success therefore satisfies the generality with optimism and so it continues to be claimed that the "Bulava" will fly without problems and even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov appears in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow out in trouble, and is likely to play in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently CSKA president.
After Denis Kuljas got injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club Sergei Nemcinov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will affect only one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, co-player Nemcinov noted.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game, according to AP.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, attributing 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Chamber.
Hyundai gives in to trade unions, all overtime will be abolished
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to abolish all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime orders, the trade union announced a strike readiness on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai Motor Company spokesman Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a layer on Saturday this week.
We cannot give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed on the grounds that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on Saturday.
The staff will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they have to pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28th, extending the Christmas holidays, Vanek noted.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer are paid for the ticket and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of the demands and complaints of the trade unions that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to abolish all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk noted.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work two overtime hours practically every day after the eight-hour layer.
With the signing of the agreement, the strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unions are scheduled for Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on fulfilling the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, argued that employees must make overtime to meet the car supply needs.
The unions also called for no sanctions on workers who stopped production on Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions are calling for reducing overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5,000 crowns this year.
Hyundai’s Nosovice automobile factory now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production began in the company in November last year.
As of this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on ‘stolen’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also works against the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not affect common viral variants as strongly as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS disease cannot be cured.
However, the drug composition can prolong the life of patients and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a whole host of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral proliferation has also resulted in the development of resistant viruses against which no drugs are effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical and Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metallocarbonates act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral proliferation in different ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come up with new “improved” compounds, which have been prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus-protein.
The metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two diverse cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homogeneous and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus splitting caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would form.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release released by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole rows of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of methocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the medicines used clinically, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, along with its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the methocarbohydrates interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget.ODS went on Fischer, who defends himself
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "horrific" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence in his opinion.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as “strong statements”.
I think there is time for analysis.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he intends to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however with leftist amendments of more than 12 billion crowns.
The Parliament has increased the money for public official salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the social democracy’s proposals to increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic has a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has fulfilled the wish of the government, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and meaninglessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up with the prime minister for Monday after the government deal.
He said he is considering remaining in office.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
To what extent Fischer is in favor of the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning sickness pay and pensions or the Civil Service Act.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not go wrong
This is the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people sitting in deputy positions who confess to the TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer chooses to give up the struggle against the deficit level of the public finances, "it is completely logical and correct that he relies on the leftist majority that is currently in parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens’ Democrats.
I haven’t thought about it, and if it’s up to date, then I’ll be dealing with it,” Martin Bartak, the defense minister nominated by the Democrats, told reporters in Parliament.
PM Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council meeting in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister.
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the MEPs to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not imagine ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation on the budget due to the absence of the party chairman in parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I did not notice that my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about Bolshevising the Parliament and destroying everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will run for roughly the same price.
The Czech Railways will close or restrict some of the less loaded high-speed and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2 percent from the date of entry into force of the new schedule compared to today.
Most tariffs, including base and customer fare, are unchanged.
Several connections to the capital are provided, for example, to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses Pendolino-type trains for this route.
The high-speed train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer high-speed trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle, the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be cancelled and the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the residents of Milovice have to move to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-haul routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Main Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
Pendolino passengers will no longer be able to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
Regional Railway Account: Increase by 200 Million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the railway will receive four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just as this year.
This year, regional trains will cost 200 million Czech crowns more.
For local trains and high-speed trains, the railway has signed a new 10-year contract, so far the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, that is why it has not taken advantage of the price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur for one-day online tickets CD Net and for cheap online tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the plug driven, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants have arrested more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Militants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary schoolchildren and their teachers.
This was by AFP, which initially only about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Around 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as living shields in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to deliver the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police pursued the kidnappers for the violence that called for retaliation between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a standing law was imposed over the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, linked to the election to the governorate, were 30 journalists.
Due to suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, peace talks with the Philippine government were resumed.
South Africa’s history affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film “Invictus: The Unbeaten” will be coming to the American cinemas, covering part of the life story of former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly re-elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the movie's release, the reactions of critics and the public are also loud.
by Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
He was awarded the Sachar Prize in 1988 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 together with De Klerk.
He was elected President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are placed on the film as it comes to theaters at a time when South Africa culminates in preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media shakes the world public with frightening news about rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are for the moment largely positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela in person, so that I - as they say - can receive his energy, he noted in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can use this film to resonate with Mandela’s personality and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, freely translated "In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that United the People", portraying the South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
During the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and for years and days mutually delimited populations, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in his role in the South African National Rugbydress on the World Cup field, which then won South Africa.
For entering the lawn in a dress, which is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela gathered great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience, and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may accomplish it, in turn, bringing people together into a single nation, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the situation in South Africa will improve will only be seen.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as the rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK, revealed in a recent interview for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area burning transformers for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformator of the company Ceps in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire department of Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted the transformers to burn out, but later they changed their mind and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water-foam and special dehumidifiers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer shortcut.
No one was injured, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova, the accident did not jeopardize the safety operation of the pipeline system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more accurately the damage will be estimated only after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformator must be replaced with a new one.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened with Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, the fire of the traffic station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates on the Czech territory as the sole operator of the wiring system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Itins, renovates and develops 39 switching plants with 67 transformers, which transfer electricity into the distribution system and pipeline with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura is charged with defamation against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is filing criminal charges today for defamation against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Morocco, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the rosines, while we submitted the offer only over the scope as it was coordinated with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were completed last week.
We have nothing else but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander by the student agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he said he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
We are preparing an indictment against the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of criminal charges to be a continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this case that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the district’s detrimental move.
He told the radio journal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after New Year.
He said he will lead the anti-corruption campaign.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not issued any tenders for the order in the amount of SEK 150 billion.
According to Vancura, such behavior is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn’t give up, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Pneumococcal vaccination free of charge and voluntary
Pneumococcal vaccination will change the usual from January.
It is free and voluntary for families.
But already now there are voices that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute has already set the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on August 2 last year and later can be vaccinated for free against pneumococci.
The condition is that you have not yet received a dose of the vaccine.
Those who started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further re-vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for vaccination of younger children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all surface vaccinations of children.
Compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including cerebral dermatitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children under 10 years of age every year in our country, after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory pneumococcal vaccination of children has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
This vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
From January this will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
That the obligatory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the Nahla citizens’ association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has long advocated for pneumococcal vaccination.
The specialists at the international conference at which our association participated were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we managed to enforce at least that.
I think that’s the path we need to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At the moment, we are not considering this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
The chairman of the professional association of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was launched as voluntary,” says Dr. Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to get their babies vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is paid by health insurance and not by the state as the first surface vaccination.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so they save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased through the insurance companies and the doctors would receive them by the same route as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some MPs, however, feared that the insurance companies could thus "pull out the money from health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to purchase the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
It is estimated that the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant amount.
It’s not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught with a trailer while inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a drill to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family riot.
The agency that according to a police oath statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should penetrate the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency that Frank Frazetta Senior denied giving any permission.
Labour advocates tax and employment increases
The ministers defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the preliminary report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor was also attacked for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent limit on public salary statements for 2011.
Social Security Disasters
The unions, on the other hand, have protested that low-wage workers are being punished for a recession they have not caused and have warned of upcoming “problems.”
The rise in social security — to about £3 billion a year — has upset the private sector, which says it’s a job tax, even though the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Priority points of the preliminary report
Increase of social security by another 0.5 % from April 2011
This year, the economy shrunk by more than the expected 4.75%
50% tax on banking bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax for small rejected
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
State pensions increased by 2.5%
According to the Treasury’s estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 a year, and someone with £40,000 a year will be poorer by £190 while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be richer by £110.
The ministers said their goal of reducing the deficit by 2013 would mean "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the 5% of the top earner.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit reduction and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he is confident that the economy will return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour’s forecasts on future economic growth – which will affect the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit clearance – were challenged after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt would be 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
“A Missed Opportunity”
Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned debt of £789 billion would be unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and “cynically” press themselves before difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They said nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
“Significant announcements will only be made after the election, no matter who wins it.”
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police should be protected from future cuts, unlike in the conservative proposals, which see deficit cuts coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned by the tax increases and spending stops will be used to cover spending for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, thus arguing that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said something at the time of the announcements — such as the above inflation adjustment on some disability pensions in April next year — would expose the Treasury chancellor to the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
“Hohler State”
Although the ministers have not revealed details of the budget beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will not come to bear until the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said the Treasury Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future, including transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said its manager Robert Chote.
“The significant announcements will only be made after the election, regardless of who wins it,” said Roger Bootle, an economic adviser at Deloitte.
“This was just the hollow preliminary report, the markets recognize it.”
FBI investigates “arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan”
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an assault on a house in Sarghoda, the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were missing in Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are believed to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are being charged with and under what circumstances they are being detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges have yet been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but said the U.S. needs to “work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns “abuse” in Iran
According to a report by human rights organization Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details “abuse patterns” by the regime, both before and after the contested June presidential election.
One man quoted in the report that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights balance sheet.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to imprisonment and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then there has been no longer any tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
“False Confession”
Amnesty International quoted the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
“They hit me in the face often,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty.
Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he and 75 others had been held in a container at a prison in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the reactions of the government to it, but Amnesty said the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park was established Skihang
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a racing track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders fighting for money prizes.
At the top of the hangar in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jumping hike at the beginning of a 100 meter long hangar.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in his fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hang, but it was also pretty intimidating.
It’s a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added, “There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here – some real talents.”
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art - or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still you and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a ban on building minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated — and integrated — into one of Europe’s most explicitly secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and dense study of a controversial issue that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half and whose effects can still be seen today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a more comprehensive and daring spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic free spaces."
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students on the issues that worry them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and homosexual rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up everyday life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media occupies.
The author recognises a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Bowen interviewed mostly disagree with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of the purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia – who now show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions how much French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognises a “strengthening of the value screws” rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say “Yes, but not yet.”
The most consoling view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them is melting at an alarming rate, taking life with it that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their boiling water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the North, the Ice Bear.
Travelling through the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proven themselves in the hunt for icy bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with an icy bear as a brave 14-year-old feather to the sea, who fought only with his muskete’s pistol, is a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 ice bears in one performance.
Even today, zoo plants still typically own one millionth of the living area of a wild animal.The climate is rarely suitable: Singapore’s icy bear became entirely green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where Inuit hunters in helicopters and motor sliders use powerful storm rifles to bring their prey to the way.
Ironically, in the waters north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a captivating insight into how the future could evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries made it possible for the first time to guess the twisting of the package ice.
In the Cold War, submarines moderated the shifting grades when submerged.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outdoors in the cold.
Anderson takes a look into the strange, tiny world of the outflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater resin salts that are compressed when frozen.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopically small wonders in the ice, they’re all threatened when the summer ice goes away, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
Marines were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington.
The liberated De'Angello Robinson travelled seven hours by bus to lay a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, no matter where we are being brought back from, we could be that, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to lay crowns on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and a few others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It’s now an 18-year-old tradition, and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 crowns on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas on the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial Site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crown.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back something to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older tombs from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War, as they are not visited as often as the newer tombs, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples held each other by the hand as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, located nearby, where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the dark mood of current wars filled this area.
Some were crying openly, others were praying, and families and friends were holding together in the icy air.
Some read loudly the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white space cards that had been laid in the wet mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, driving to visit the graveyard of Naval Infantry sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ... my son paid for it, she said.
“When I’ve been away for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and for the World Bank.
U.S. Consular Officers in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not yet been released, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything accused of “threatening.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who frequently describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly sought permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between Castro’s brother’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will pay back if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average earning of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only since this year allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, it is mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily salary.
Internet access is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens imprisoned in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interest Office in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information about the arrest.
The arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
One activity that would be legal in any other free society – giving free mobile phones – is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently released a harsh report on freedom in Cuba titled “New Castro, the same Cuba,” a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government is often provoking a negative reaction in the United States, precisely at a time when the two countries are moving towards each other for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plans to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities uncovered a supposed leader of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers on Saturday, saying they hoped this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they had sought an oppressive rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after searching for them because one of them had submitted approving comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official informed about the matter said on Saturday Saifullah was unable to convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to immigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the hostile mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That’s why they were rejected, the government official said, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were not at all discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men – who are still in Pakistan and being questioned by the FBI – underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to accommodate human active posts within al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as patrons who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American volunteer recruits are undergoing a special test by A.K.A., analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access in recent years, as the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed,” Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of Thousands Demonstrate in Copenhagen for Climate Action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding that the negotiators at the city’s Bella Congress Center take more bold action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were about 25,000.
The event went relatively peacefully despite a handful of masked activists firing small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners on which it was written in English, “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish, “The Earth says “Enough.”
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to Peru, her mother’s birthplace, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is struggling with due to the already tangible impacts of climate change.
That’s part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the big demonstration – to deliver the word and appeal to world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there’s no way around it anymore.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate talks, masked demonstrators in black clothes ignited several explosives near the Copenhagen Main Canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as lightning rockets but were then followed by “a few large explosions.”
Inside the congress centre, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thinks the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “That’s something I wasn’t aware of.”
He then went on to Mandarin and said, “Because the venue is large, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data reveals persistent racial gap
The math performance testimonials were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C. last week.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country’s highest-performing schools, testimonials show that fourth and eighth grade students have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth grade students from Washington D.C. has risen from 262 to 270 over the past two years (on a 500 scale), but that of their African American peers has risen by only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-grade remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample scope was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth-classers in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in that district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by the children of both groups has grown over this time period, the difference has hardly diminished with 58 points now.
Some district education advocates last week expressed concern that the outcomes celebrated by school cleric Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and challenging, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating for education equality in Washington D.C.
I’m not jumping up and down for a range of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city’s secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, which I respect.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we would have to spend on our high school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and are significantly behind their peers.
Daily Mathematics, a curriculum that emphasizes games and real-life experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum attributes some of the NAEP advances last week.
I think we need to continue to work to give the best measures to benefit students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the underperforming schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examined urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have political repercussions that work against this important item of the agenda.
The weakness is, of course, like other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teacher union last year on 185 days a year, which he sees as a "milestone" on the way to a greater boost in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a future outlook
The bus arrives at the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stands out and flashes for a moment by seeing the white columns, the brick facades, and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents have barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never even set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-grade members of the group exploring Gettysburg, where the lessons cost $38,690 a year, was more that of a reverent visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really?” she said thoughtfully when she was about the school’s low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children attended on their three-day tour, and now they have fully embraced the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who fail to finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispano-Americans graduate from college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single action at some point won’t solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Hispanic-American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP – Switching A Walk Up – and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have attended college.
Iraqi oil ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government was able to force major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq’s oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has submitted a bid has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to sign contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European companies are taking their way, Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, told an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq.
Security concerns, underlined by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability due to the withdrawal of the U.S. military, have likely deterred U.S. oil companies, analysts said to engage more in Iraq, which holds the world’s third-largest proven crude oil reserves.
U.S. companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies able to enter into contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been supporting with technical advice in recent years, have left empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-run China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world’s largest economies as well as a technology power.
We are confident that the Chinese company can compete with its suppliers and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies submitted bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda Planner Killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile strike along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials on Friday.
This would be, if confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs allegedly killed, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, by a number of rockets hitting their vehicle on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in the North Waziristan province.
Local authorities that the missiles were fired from a drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s illegal tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle toward the Afghan border when the car was hit, a spokesman for a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the scene and quickly took everything that was left of the “completely destroyed bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials brought uncertain evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noting a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referring to the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Given its central role, this included planning attacks on the United States and Europe.
He received strategic instructions from the top leaders of al-Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia has rapidly risen in the al-Qaeda hierarchy andins best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not in any way diminish the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has dropped from an average of six operations per month to two since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a websiteined by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspicious informants, the site.
UN envoy to Kabul resigns
The top UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign in March, ending a stormy term torn by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The oath comes after the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We must accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghan people that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid to help Afghanistan's political transformation.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Jide said he will not resign, but will only fulfill an agreement made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now to be forwarded so that he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I’ve said is that he’d better start looking for a successor, Jide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to UN officials.
UN officials say he considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
The oath's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith’s charges — who were fired — “unquestionably harmed the mission because there was already a large level of skepticism about international interference in the election.”
Jide said he has recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid efforts of the US-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying this would strengthen their confidence that their money will be used properly.
Jide expressed his disappointment over the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the inconvenient UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring capable people in.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is disastrous and should not continue like this.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not taking part in talks about its nuclear plans.
During a seven-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, playing down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things on my mind, if we’ve learned something from Iraq in the last six years, is the unpredictability of the war.”
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons” because “his people will suffer tremendously” from the sanctions.
In a statement on Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology is intended to be obtained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to limit its nuclear program and give up a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then — in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership has disagreed on whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran simply left the international community behind in terms of some of the proposals they had already agreed on at the beginning of October, openly speaking, brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in ways they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “oppressive sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some members of the Security Council about Iranian nuclear activities and said they were willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, “We will retain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
Changes in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, suddenly beginning to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: “Not at all.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
Nothing remains for a second child, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, debilitated single children lovingly called "little emperors", a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN says.
Department of Population affairs stated that while the number of the population aged 60 and older is expected to rise explosively by 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent, this is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for 22 percent of residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, said couples in childbearing age need to have babies to “help reduce the ratio of aging population and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
"Shanghai will soon be as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Anchored in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision ever introduced by the ruling Communist Party.
Couples who violate this policy will face enormous fines – up to three times their annual salary in some regions – and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have attributed this policy to avoiding critical exploitation of the country’s natural resources, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to evacuate.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule—including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children—and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with one partner being single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters teaching families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has dispatched city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and scatter information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town outside Shanghai said there is a rise in applications from couples who want a second child after the campaign launched, urban districts, on the other hand, report no change.
For example, in the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that this is legally permitted.
But they, like many Chinese, only have a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are being deprived of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem is not just in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff manager, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. ”We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others, and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-sized parents with double careers that reduce birth rates, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20 to 39-year-olds grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you must already have a resume for the best preschool."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many victims.
UN Group launches plan for emissions reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has once again placed a focus on the next 40 years with the publication of a document that records ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, with the most burden to be borne by the industrialized nations in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has identified both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that expires time as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a special UN working group, silences the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policy makers would contribute to.
The process is given a lot of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate representative, Yvo de Boer, called “the big whole.”
It shows the basis for a possible agreement by which the industrialized nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted Friday’s talks with its pledge to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change – from mastering floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks of last week had determined.
U.S. climate adviser Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not funded by industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is driving a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging nations rising up and taking action, according to Stern, who also complained that the text is not going far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued his statement an hour after the statement by Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said the leading U.S. climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or it was "extremely irresponsible" from him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China cope with global warming.
By putting the future economic direction of the world’s great powers at stake, breaches have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates to both saving individual economies and saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that the great powers are struggling to figure out who should bear the cost of braking greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to act more aggressively in holding the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the offensive of the small island states “exerces political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and call for action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks gained a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most open issues need to be clarified before the arrival of the leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Prime Minister, took off their planes and rushed through the Bella Center corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The pure scale of the assembly -- 13,000 people enter and exit the congress centre every day, guitar-playing activists host night shows where they make fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are hand-to-hand instead of e-mailed -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just growing: Almost all major ministers are now here and from Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the upper league,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines the mountain feeling
On Monday morning at 5:00 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed donor train in the country will travel from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras at 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then visit Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network with faster, more reliable trains and connect the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could turn into vibrant migrant cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brakes on British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will submit the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places where environmental impacts are controversial, with a range of five meters.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed railway network.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham, and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best-functioning option,” a railway insider said.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs would allow the trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed so that 400 meters of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could operate per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal station in London would be needed to handle 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks this plan should continue or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be made after parliamentary elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, so the travel time between London and Scotland would continue to be more than three hours.
This is considered a crucial crash point in ensuring a shift from aircraft to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Appeal for Mortgage for £75,000 Orange of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative House member, has charged taxpayers thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange factory he built in his residence in his electoral district.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that House members had to live “from lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by £75,000 to build a oak farm at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House officials approved the applications at the time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the House members' spending. Last night Duncan said the applications "couldn't have been cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the House, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1,1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending checkpoint of the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a winter garden, which is referred to in the plans as "Orangerie".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on increased fundraising during a recent investigation into his previous mortgage contracts.
The committee released him from breaking the rules last month after an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London home to his electoral district house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to parliament.
Documents released this week show that by March last year, Duncan received about £1,400 ($1,500) per month refunded as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than £1,800 (€2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage remained unchanged during this period, suggesting that the overall increase was used to finance the £75,000 (€85,000) cash-out.
The normal RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to £1,250 (€1,400) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as House of Commons opposition leader in September after an undercover reporter filmed him as he said after the spending scandal that MPs would live "from lean rations."
“Basically, when you work for the state, it means that you have to live on low-fat rations and be treated like S*****e.”
He said, “I spent my money on my garden and claim a disappearing small portion, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole damn amount, but I’m not doing it.”
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May for his spending when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this could be considered “an exaggerated claim.”
An activist has digged a hole in the shape of a pound mark in Duncan's lawn as a protest after it became known that he had demanded £4,000 over three years.
When asked last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, “This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for value increase.”
He added: “There is no debate about evading and crawling or twisting the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's Beach Cottage Advent Calendar
Beach chalets in Brighton have found new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas songs as a theme for each December day.
The event started on December 1st, and visitors were allowed to watch the newest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free glühwein and traditional mint pies, baked with dried fruits.
The chosen Christmas songs so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", with the hütt decoration here being the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer cleric of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important again for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building?I think the church should go to the people and host exciting celebrations.
The idea for a beach cottage advent calendar began as a conversation with a few friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have made hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, and hundreds of thousands according to organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday that could come into effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes, as illustrated by these demonstrations, to the fact that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, crushed display windows with cartridges and hammer, a journalist told AFP.
Anti-revolt police immediately and without consideration, intervened.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, according to their estimates mostly members of the “Black Blocks,” these extremely violent split groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested “without distinction,” and stressed that about a hundred of them “were still held in the streets on Saturday night,” despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and seated positions.
The rather peaceful train went from parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the planned speakers for a candlestick evening with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by buses and trains from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were also present.
Around 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky-blue rain jackets, made a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen as they followed the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can’t keep on saying, we have time,” said Angelique Kidjo, a Benin singer.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, rivers where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, the figure of the globalization critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between fighting climate warming and fighting for a different world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are at risk due to warming, has been the trigger for the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
There were several hundred people in Manila, mostly students who marched in red and lifted bandanas in which you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network “350” gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a “streik.”
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the “streik.”
Around 131,000 people were called to take part in the first election since the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
Electoral participation was approximately 58 percent a few hours before the closing of the polling station, according to the Abkhazian election commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the current president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under total occupation, his press spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
Having separated itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, killing several thousand people, Abkhazia wants to demonstrate through this election that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful Black Sea landscapes.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an indication of Moscow’s support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, replied, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this threshold, a second round of elections must be held within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide Demos, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready to act at any time, arrested about 700 people on the brink of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive delegates from 193 countries until December 18, looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to enter.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for a candlestick evening with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed entirely in black and armed with bricks and hammer, began hitting discs, a AFP journalist noted.
Anti-revolt police immediately surrounded you and intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Black Bloc, these extremely violent split groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
On the evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested, a police officer suffered injury to the cheek by a plasterstone.
"We have the extremist groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as police helicopters were flying in the air.
Most of the protesters arriving by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen this morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be paid back to the people of the South,” said activist Lidy Nacpil to the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say anymore: we still have time,” said singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that melt, there are streams through which you can walk, which has never happened before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organisations.
The French MEP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to “connect climate justice and social justice.”
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, to address the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus for the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, made advertisements for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong and Jakarta have also gathered to protest climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects geography and history are reinforced by the school reform of the Lycées.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview appearing in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects geography and history emerge strongly from the school reform of the Lycées, even though they are not required to be taught in the terminal (12th school year).
“Students of the 11th school year now have the same program every four hours a week,” says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because, according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration of "the best students."
“The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one,” he continued, emphasizing: “I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographic education in the terminals of technical lycées.”
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité revealed that seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the state’s project of removing compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th academic year with scientific profile).
The Minister responded that there was no question of a limitation of the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe will sacrifice the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister noted that in Master 2 (M2) they will undergo a proficiency test at the beginning of the year and an admission test at the end of the year, where their teaching skills will be tested.
They also conduct internships during the year at M2 and then teach a year in front of the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: “If you add all of the internships offered before the performance test, you’ll get even more hours you’ve spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He reiterated that he intends to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d’Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, during which experts address the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something that reaches people and gives them the feeling of wanting to know more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22, and one of the organizers of that day, on the sidelines of the conference.
"Among the experts, about twenty participants were selected, also according to their charisma," he said.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be outlined in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely about 50 people only with the help of slides.
“That’s part of our role as scientists,” he said, hoping that the audience will learn that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier.”
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next “Ernest” day is scheduled for February and will then take place every two months.
Delayed Payment: Angry Prison Guards, Action Planned
The unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action on Friday to that the premiums and overtime, whose payment was postponed until January for budgetary reasons, will be transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers (FO-Pénitentiaire) called on employees who do not have a job to demonstrate tomorrow in front of the prison facility and block it to alert to the “theft of what they deserve.”
The 3rd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "unification for a strong mobilization in the various prisons" to mark the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges and Sunday and holidays in December as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for “general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger.”
The leadership of the Penitentiary Department and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all were provided in the budget, however, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officials, guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
“I am well aware of the staff’s efforts to keep our imprisonment system functional and to modernize it,” the Justice Minister said in the letter.
“I have instructed the management of the prison department to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the occurring overtime, does not repeat itself in the future,” added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December salary is thus low, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the “budgetary constraints” must remain.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces to boycott "all assemblies and conventions" until new instructions are given.
"The staff will not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October in December are still not paid, including their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne threatens.
“At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without hiring more personnel, trying to enrich ourselves on the personnel funds is more than inappropriate,” the CGT trade union of Bordeaux said.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
But in any case, it is wrong, says UFAP Secretary-General Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he always distributes better gifts at Christmas than he gets.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family at the White House for the first time, spoke to TV speaker Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special show broadcast on ABC on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they would spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” Michelle Obama reaffirmed, adding that the dog, of course, also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts: “I gave you beautiful gifts last year.”
“So please,” he grieved her sadly, pointing to the first lady’s pearl chain, “and who gave you this one?”
During this one-hour broadcast in unforced atmosphere with the well-known television host that Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-pass bike and also a basketball his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to him on Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us on Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"It was only much later in my life that I realized that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her puppet house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace.
Johnny Hallyday is operated again, RTL confirms he has been placed in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated again in Los Angeles for significant "damages" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors had found "injury due to the operation of a cord disc injury" he suffered on November 26 in Paris, according to his production company in Paris, which added that the injury would have required a re-operation.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to make it clear that the situation is "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be available no later than 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma to avoid “pain and complications.”
However, it wasn’t until after 48 hours that one was slightly more sure about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirmed that "specific sources indicate" that "no drainage" was placed after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a cord disc injury.
The procedure, planned over several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available for comment on RTL on Thursday night.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a post-operative infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a “deep valley.”
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacts well to the antibiotics” and that “the infection is inhibited.”
Mr. Camus also stated that he spoke with Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and he did not feel any particular concern about it.
Nevertheless, concerns about the singer’s health have grown since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, it was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer" which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was only in mid-November that the people around him had to deny a reintroduction to the hospital.
Euro 2009/short track: first place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time winner of medals at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane costumes were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 meters and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 meters of men.
A pity for Bousquet, who wanted to hit the world record in 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec., in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in growing and in this case I’ve said when the world record is in my reach, I’ll try it.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane costumes, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which first began in the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77) yet he has set himself up with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my mission.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
Tomb of Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman grave plate that appeared exactly at the French writer Emile Zola was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm tall; it dates back to the third century AD and has always been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece.There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, Sotheby's vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is what buyers have offered the most for so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes a long way back.
The record was home to the famous collection of the Borghese family in Rome for almost 300 years, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
While browsing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras to Mexico has been defeated
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran president Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil no longer compatible, after this leadership was rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya overnight, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
According to the immigration authority, the plane, which was stationed by the Mexican government and arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring Mr Zelaya, has returned to its place of origin.
The coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "abdicate" and request political asylum for him abroad.
However, the ousted president refused to do so, wanting to return to Mexico as the most welcomed, serving head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has been ongoing in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar,” added the downed president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago.
The Mexican embassy has submitted to us a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept because it does not include an application for asylum, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not apply for asylum in any country at all," Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur channel.
A possible departure from Honduras, he stressed, he would only undertake as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors about Mr Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the overthrown president, who had opened up and gathered around the Brazilian embassy, after which the military there had intensified its action.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal character of this government in view of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, on the day of the popular poll he organized in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves them, he will be imprisoned for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup-run president Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the contested election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress had massively voted against Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures of the U.S. trade balance show a recovery of the stock of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones rose by 0.67%, and the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has risen from 7.13 points to 2.190,06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose to 1.102.35 points with 0.58% (6.40 points).
There are good news from various sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
This, however, remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is only focused on “half-full glasses,” she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the U.S. trade balance sheet, “which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% from September to 32.9 billion dollars in October.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the United States’ major trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the Economy.com corporate research.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States rose against all expectations last week and have now reached 474,000 requests.
However, the average number of new job seekers has “falled to the lowest point of the year over the past four weeks,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The profitability of 10-year government bonds rose to 3,482% from 3,432% on Tuesday evening, the profitability of 30-year bonds to 4,492% against 4,408% on the night before.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans whisper “Ladies in White”
A few hundred Cuban-powered partisans fired the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights on Thursday and also dissuaded another rally that temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty “Ladies in White,” wives or close relatives of political prisoners, were beaten out on the open street by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were marching to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist confirmed to AFP.
Down with the Yankees!, "Salary!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" scanded the empowered partisans with raised fist against the dissident women.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the “Ladies in White” took place on the eve in Havana, where there were no injuries or arrests.
In the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents who also took part in a demonstration on the occasion of the International Day of Human Rights on Thursday were temporarily arrested by civilian police, a reporter confirmed to AFP.
According to the journalist, the police have forced the dissidents exploited by the government’s partisans to enter civilian vehicles by force.
Temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the “Ladies in White” organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of the “Pray for the release of all political prisoners”, whose number according to the dissident list has about 200 persons, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda serves a prison sentence of 20 years.
Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently in prison.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as “salaryers” or “agents” in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television on Thursday’s demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of undermining rights and freedoms, in particular the freedom of expression.
Man kills eighty-year-old with a knife and leaves five injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and wounded five others.
According to preliminary information from the interrogation, the 28-year-old attacker had wounded the 80-year-old for unclear reasons in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police data, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to an official of the police syndicate Alliance, is in the hospital suffering the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about the age of thirty, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to the hospital with serious injuries, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life because, according to police sources, vital organs appear to have been affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state", according to a police source.
The armed man, who, according to police, appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had injured two other passers, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of both being serious.
The scene remained in the dark at night.
He was armed with two carnivores, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance syndicate in the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers, including teenagers, are said to have tried to bandage the madman, according to the reports of witnesses identified by AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three young men tried to get in.
They failed because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waitress at a nearby bar,.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with knife bites, police said.
The incident took place in one of the main arenas of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers approached me to tell me that there was a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a folding wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, arrived, injured by cuts.
Police arrested the man who did not carry passports.
The Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office has commissioned the district council of the Hauts-de Seine Criminal Police Division (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out that he will be admitted to a nerve hospital.
According to another police source, he was stabbed by six policemen to band him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the course of the act."
US: Polanski's lawyer calls for suspension of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to allow the prosecution against his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland for a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of The Pianist, has complained before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal of gross errors at the time of the negotiation in 1977.
I demand removal on the spot, M. Hummel explained before adding that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was commissioned at the time of the trial with the case, "left it to a cold back."
According to him, the - now dead - judge Rittenband, before he gave his judgment, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved jail - which is a serious procedural mistake.
This discussion was sparked in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), specifically by the contested prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, Wells claimed to have lied to the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court refuse to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr. Hummel will request the conduct of a trial that would allow him to submit the evidence for his arguments.
The prosecution, on its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the cancellation of the facts accused the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, before the penalty was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?
According to her, "the filmmaker is asking the court for a favor and thus despise his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to announce their decision, even stressed that “there are other alternatives to flee.”
Hummel was not the only one to request the suspension of the criminal prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of the victim, Samantha Geimer, also demanded the cancellation of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure being harassed by every resurrection of the Polanski affair, adding: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 following an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months in prison, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a price, in a market that broke between better indicators than those foreseen in the United States and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tightly limited, the trading volume has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the release of better than expected economic indicators, which “have helped improve the market outlook for the solidity of the recovery of the economy,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summed up.
In the U.S., retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, U.S. consumer confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index forecast.
However, the indices were slowed by a new rise in the dollar, which has reached its two-month high against the euro, pushing down “the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bond increased by 3,540% on Wednesday evening from 3,482% and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4,497% against 4,492% on the day before.
Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World on Saturday will overcome the last obstacle to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a real struggle of pleasure.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was just extraordinary.
I have seen a lot of things and experienced a lot of things! said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (15 p.m. Central European time).
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experiences with candidates and the rediscovery of "wonderful landscapes".
After a month of gala, trials, press meetings and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to once be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget in a swimsuit.
The show will be presented by a television host, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a hardly exaggerated warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, president of the Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, took a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, but this time by bicycle and tasted the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma was quite exceptional, who gave them a hand.
Not unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote for this event a little more.
I’m wrong with people I would probably never approach otherwise.
I will definitely be back at the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 a.m. local time.
The singer’s son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go “as soon as possible” to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial successive infection after surgery on a ligament disc injury on 26 November in Paris.
The singer "was placed in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and be able to carry out his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the morbid changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at a French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer told AFP.
The head of the department of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely stressed neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus explained.
I’ve heard that a legal proceedings may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday “travelled to Los Angeles too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon.”
I spoke to this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much since I myself had already had two bandwidth surgeries.
Shortly before, he told RTL that the singer appeared to have left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a questionable reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical chamber, described him as "a man without scruples" who has to be "regularly" accountable to the chamber board and "everything else is not recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday via his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative examinations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been accumulating since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou’s MoDem party, on Friday reacted sharply to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, urging him, under the threat of prosecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after handing out the left.
The Defense Minister, whose party partner is the UMP, by the way, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As a reinforcement of his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF trademark, as he was the first to apply for this trademark in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle".
However, the office of the UDF party alliance, which was supervised by François Bayrous’s friends, broke the silence and clearly stated that they would not be expropriated and, under the threat of prosecution, set a deadline for the Minister and the Deputy to stop using this seal and to transfer to it the rights of ownership of the trademark.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would suggest your political movement to take over the UDF seal, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, printed on its political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office stated, and urged the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
Furthermore, it required Hervé de Charette “to transfer the property rights of the trademark to its legal entitled persons”.
If you refuse to do so, we will prosecute you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that “UDF” has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends “have made the choice” to leave this 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party “UMP”.
The party Nouveau centre therefore, according to the signatories, has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the establishment of a branch to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way, from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you consider that this carelessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC’s strategy: “It seems more worthy to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for ourselves rather than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name to which you have no legal claims.”
Affair Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre on Friday ruled to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the billionaire’s daughter Liliane Bettencourt claims, he exploited an eighty-year-old’s weak moment to squeeze a portion of their wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be held liable in court on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years and a fine of €375,000.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair, worthy of the saga of one of France’s wealthiest families, in which mother and daughter grasp each other while at the same time holding the branches of the cosmetic empire L’Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L’Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, not under the conditions submitted by the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 clearly stating whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the hearing.
As for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court’s decision.
This is an excellent news (...). the opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that you have to protect, he reiterated.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years to make donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by a photographer she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ plaidoyers on Friday led to a large family deficit.
For instance, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer referred to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she suspects the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Can you please explain to my daughter that I have been writing on banners for fifteen years, once or twice a day?
I have never been able to talk to Françoise since her marriage."
The Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office once again believes that the applicant had no right to react in this way, mainly because a guardianship judge has in recent days rejected her request to initiate judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney said.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Management revolution or the end of strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain.
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large corporations in relation to its employees, said the position of the company vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determined to impose the best, as it was previously on consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation to separate products factors to impose customer preferences again on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) demands “from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach”; it demands from its employees a commitment that is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That’s why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist of placing employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing alongside customers.
The Benefits of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will the internal polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange submitted to its wage-takers, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I am afraid, unfortunately not.
- First, because I was able to see that the whole fabric, in the face of a new situation, after many circumstances, finally comes to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
Originating from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, they embrace the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the U.S. "neuroscience" and has unwittingly been widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the “hebel” (sic) to employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces executives in a stance towards a mechanistic control system unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into every consideration or practice of management: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and plans.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their company on the basis of a predetermined Doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to estimate what it offers them to their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilizing factors, corporate executives can control, predict and predict their “social performance” and put their human resource management back in the right place.
Thus, they create a fertile soil favorable to the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: “Just War” brings Obama praise from the right
The American right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who mocked the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the president’s speech this time, following the example of former vice president candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself raised the topic of a "sometimes necessary" war in memoirs she also published.
War is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force; a way of declaring his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, joyful the former president of the House of Representatives, who acknowledged the reference to “the existence of evil in the world” in Obama’s words.
In some parts, I have felt this speech quite historic, Ginrich explained, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, seen by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen a “leftist president” reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they “would not be free and could not offer a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he spoke "like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a security bubble they didn't create themselves and for whose protection they don't do much," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wing, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as “dull, lofty and uninspired.”
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the recourse to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
However, the moderate left press continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, described the speech as a "monumental work" even to a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo “provides a roadmap for guiding international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the newspaper said enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Distance Drivers: Three Marathons for an Agreement to Secure Supply for Christmas
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the trade unions of the street union and the TLF - the only employer organization to stay to the end - reached an agreement on Friday night to end the strike order and the threatening severe supply gaps at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators split up early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement early in the morning.
And that despite the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) having abandoned the meeting.
However, more than six hours have passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement, and only at 6 a.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a pay increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Thus, the hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“It’s not a lot, but we start small,” says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers anymore.
"H, there will probably always be some opponents who are not happy with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the employees,” said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “an historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on “an acceptable compromise”.
The agreement also provides for a 3 % increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall road transport rate in the first half of 2010, which will enable, in particular, to address the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction in employer taxes of €100 million" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft law on adjusted finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for a "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to first apply to the companies affiliated with that organization, and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to apply to the entire profession.
This will be the case “in the shortest time”, Bussereau assures.
Opposition from employers’ associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR accused of a “fraudulent trade” because the 100 million euros “were already promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to distract the goose-eaters in the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens to “shake up a big grave for the industry’s small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months.”
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
Disruptions on RER A, France’s largest high-speed rail network for the Greater Paris and Île-de-France, continued over the weekend as a meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transportation Administration), continues to wait for strikers with their demands for wage increases.
During this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. On the main route (between La Défense and Nation) only one in two trains and only one in four trains outside the main route were operational.
Connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to switch.
The Galeries Lafayette store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “the RATP is striving to connect the major stores in transportation.”
The RER A line runs through the Paris area from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated as scheduled at main traffic time, and almost none during low traffic time.
As on Thursday, there were no people on the slopes as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the shortage of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), explained that he would have extra "gone up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to the passengers by officials and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no gaps at the Saint-Lazare train station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station to provide connections to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, major gatherings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "dough" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The Executive Director of the RER proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-standing salary surcharge.
The CGT was upset that the RATP itself is holding down its proposals for wage increases, emphasizing that the leadership “is unable to solve a problem while it was possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF.”
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "comprehensive review of working conditions" is scheduled for Monday.
This also shows to the associations that the company “ignores the weekend drivers.”
About 150 drivers searched for a committee in Paris this morning.
Again, it was the leadership that so far rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an advance announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations demand a salary increase from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants).
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of €2,200 to €2,700 and a salary surcharge of €600 to €650 for layered services and on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to greatly complicate the work of the government, which seeks to help the Kurdish community to end the 25 years of conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Hasim Kiliç, the president of the Constitutional Court, said four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution.In addition, he noted that 37 of the party’s leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, which Turk and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in the parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders stated before the verdict that parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than sit as non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a lawsuit initiated in 2007 by Turkish Federal Court Attorney Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the “instructions” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers are of the opinion that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is in the midst of the government, which seeks to address the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, to wipe out Kurdish support for the PKK and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reiterate that a dissolution could lead to a resumption of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the million-town Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
Police used tear gas grenades and water-throwers as protesters began throwing molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Turk assumed that the court’s decision “will further deepen the despair.”
“Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning a party,” he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We are in principle against the closure of the parties.
This will not solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic openness promoted by the government,” said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
“You can obviously get caught up with a reaction from the PKK,” he added.
On Thursday, the PKK acknowledged an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow may come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the head of the FES winter service.
But so that its employees can test and learn to master the entire vehicle technology.
This is the first time this year, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES operates according to a precise plan.
As soon as there is snow in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes with large-scale vehicles will be taken off, Brauburger explains.
These include main transport and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire departures, open-air transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with falls, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins at three o’clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be spread, if necessary, in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which is better attached.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It will snow until 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, “because then no one is ready to make room for the dispersed vehicles.”
Only then, if it does not continue to snow, are the Zubringer- and Erschließungsstraßen, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Straße, in turn.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, knows Brauburger.
At five o’clock in the morning, the footmen of the FES are on their way, danger points and transitions are cleared in the first place.
Often, the FES can’t take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22:30 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on this fast, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the disperser is on the go.
If necessary, the police will also call.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two-foot-long and 1.50-foot-high animal ran on two strong rear legs, had an alonged skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with seals, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not be special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then located in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the relatives, spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund Confirms Theories About Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly you can only find individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current doctrine, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primitive dinosaurs is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts are debating when the squirrels split into their three main lines of development: the meat-eating theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "longheads" and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischia (bird basin sauriers), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt and colleagues’ analysis, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced qualities, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, as they also have the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of giant sauropods later also possessed airbags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of the two groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs ever known lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the squirrels first appeared there.
Thus, the three lines of development separated from each other early on, spreading from South America to all parts of the world, which at that time, as the supercontinent Pangea, formed a single landmass.
That’s because the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not closely related theropods.
The three may not descend from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, it could result in a distorted picture, because in South America there are simply many primitive dino fossils preserved, while there is hardly anything to find on other continents.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare side line of the reptilian tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flysaurs and with numerous other squirrels.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the family extinct at the border from the Trias to the Jura.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this shift, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped to flourish a group of animals that had also developed in the Trias and has since tempted a shadow being: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto stand on, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt is blowing waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, as well as from universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, show solidarity with the protesting students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they “disapprove” of the police operation initiated by the presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been defiled.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify “the violent dismantling of self-organized teaching sessions of students and teachers by a police command.”
The evacuation represents an “unacceptable interference” in freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “delegitimate and criminalize the protest” and distracts from the content.
The chairman took away the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
Even the youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union federation solidarize themselves with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landes-Jugendsekretär Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, says CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, the Greens and the Left viewed this differently.
The CDU is using painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they cleared up.
The left has submitted a petition asking the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality, with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have established contacts with Riedberg, a science facility in Frankfurt, with the universities and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow’s Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed the planning deserter Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to set foot in the growing Russian market.
Instead, Russian research firms are seeking to obtain orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the major corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green Town") received its name from the forested hill landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
by Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set up high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than just a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a decade of healing construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created in the spirit of the 1980s.
Main railway stations with railroads ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century transportation fossils, which acted like brakes in modern rail traffic, as it once took enormous amount of time to stretch locomotives from behind forward.
Go in, keep short, move on – that’s how it goes.
And that is why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit railway station, which is about halfway between the trans-European railway highways between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessic and Bavarian metropolis it is almost inexpensive to implement the deeper laying.
Main railway stations, however, also no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and taxi cars at both ends.
Still: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE new building route to Ulm is now being approached.
Local and state politicians have implemented it.
The Railway is also involved because the risks of the Republic’s largest individual infrastructure project are borne by taxpayers and not by the state group.
The project can be justified to some extent.
A new city room is created, which - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the expansion of the route are intended for passenger transport, which was attributed to enormous growth, typically in the 1980s.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy, however, must primarily focus on strengthening freight transport, as transportation by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy climbs.
Even more seriously, S21 indirectly tangers many other railway projects as well.
More than 6 billion euros will be spent in Switzerland.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
Certainly, in the next decade, money will be missing at other nodes and gaps in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built in a timelapse pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
However, the S21 will act as a brake.
The Rhine Valley will become a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go in review against the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the VGH judgment, which covers more than 400 pages, legally reviewed, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had justified in writing that the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the planned construction of the Northwest Landebahn at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as provided by the state government, is not compatible with the statutory protection of the population from the noise of night flights.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to revise the ruling.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged government representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to ban night flights.
It is damn hard if one is allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Greens, Tarek Al-Wazir, in reference to the FDP electoral slogan "We keep the word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to get to their night flights with "right distortion and tricksery".
A thorough legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not intend to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As she represents the opposition, his group’s statements about the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-shaken major U.S. banks are tearing off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repayed a total of $45 billion ($30 billion) in aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp.
Citigroup is also planning to reimburse the state aid, according to a report by the US channel CNBC.
The institutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation in the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had secured $19 billion of fresh money from investors through conversion loans.
The rest of the sum she took from her own cash, which was well filled, among other things, by retail sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: “The money injection has helped through a very difficult time.
The money house was at the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to free itself from its obligations to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman did not comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
The quick choice
Everything went faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee decided to vote on the staff.
A favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadt-studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, in order not to interfere with the procedure.
However, it is also likely to have played a role in not further harming ZDF intendent Markus Schächter, should this proposal not pass through the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet clear at the closing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him.
Because the majority of the Union in the board of directors had already signaled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The protest against the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessen’s Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost on entry quotas, he rejected another term of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was slandered.
More recently, even 35 state-right activists had interfered in the debate, who considered Koch’s action unconstitutional.
It has benefited nothing.
to person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied Politics, Pedagogy and Romanesque.
He worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey joined the ZDF, first called the Today-Journal.
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the election of Brenders, who was elected the journalist of the year by the media magazine Medium magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s opponent in the board of directors, the Rhineland-Pfalz Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that countries should amend the ZDF state treaty so that the intendent’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender’s likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a wise move – by harshly criticizing the board immediately after Brender’s election.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Schächter and the Board of Directors were able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without loss of sight, without the suspicion of appointing a party member.
In party arithmetic, Frey is attributed to the left-left liberals.
Study is disrupted
Partial success for students: After a year of education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally took action on Thursday: at a meeting of ministers of culture and university directors, both sides agreed to want to improve the study conditions at bachelor and master.
Students should also be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test burden: Basically, each study module should be completed with only one examination.
In addition, the student’s workload will be checked and a “realistic and acceptable level” will be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination performance between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master programs more flexible.
There should also be no different national regulations.
Less examinations
Since the start of student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studying in their mouths.
For the first time, it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of exams in part drastically: "Each module usually ends with only one exam," it says in a 30-page paper that is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree courses.
With the “significant reduction of the examination burden,” accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm explained, “a misdevelopment that significantly impaired the studyability should be stopped.”
Furthermore, “studyability” is expected to be the “decisive criterion” in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" for "unnecessary constraints of students in the choice of the
Events are avoided.
The students would have "the right to receive spaces that enable and encourage self-initiative."
The rules should apply for the admission of new courses, but also for the review of existing courses.
These must be “re-accredited” every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this, which are under the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture urged the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the abundance of materials is not too large and the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities have already agreed with the state ministries on corresponding measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz has granted additional funding for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities will primarily set up tutor programs and strengthen study counseling as well as examination and overseas offices.
The state and universities will spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a new Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for completion of a study model.
The design of the study will be more flexible, the recognition of certificates at other universities will be ensured and the access to the Master will be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all study programs in the country will be checked for their studying ability.
The government and the opposition again disputed on the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
Besides praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal board of Juso university groups called for the formation of education policy to no longer take place “behind closed doors” of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students as affected should now also "speak a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the Conference of Higher Education Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK is advising on a joint reform paper.
For the trade union Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn decisions did not go far enough overall: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that there are enough master’s positions with the best possible study conditions available for today’s generation of undergraduate students tomorrow, says Andreas Keller, Member of the Board of Directors of GEW.
Countries need to hire more teachers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on free access to the master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
Entrance into and out of Germany is almost no control...” is the beginning line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, in which he in disturbing phrases thematizes the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom but has lost his speech.
Born in 1951, Werner Söllner worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children’s book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary attention last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of its securities".
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he confessed to Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his collaboration as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun swiftly, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "so someone who has not defended himself enough against attempts to intimidate the Securitate."
Lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of Romanian-born German authors is shaken by a case that reveals the abyss and degradation of a political system based on surveillance and scrutiny.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate act, IM Walter has played a role, according to Söllner’s confession, said the literary scholar Michael Markel, referring to IM Walter’s positive influence on him.
He “cut him out” in all the difficult points for him at the time, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not entirely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate’s spike, Herta Müller had already written in July at the time, after reading her own record, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may suppose, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike with the now very procedural viewing of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the remains of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic enlightenment has been delayed and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthler Authority was established only in 1999, but the issuance of the acts has since been rather slow.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller proved in an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar commented disgustingly on the laureate.
She has a psychosis and has only been interviewed once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, in the case of Söllner, as is often the case in the context of covert guilt, inevitable questions arise.
The attentive reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge for knowledge rather than by blame and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Satisfaction Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a well-dressed outdoor worker coming from a very nice Christmas party where a sports goodies manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the equipment manager, climbed into a passing C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the striking gloss was allowed to drive because of the city still strange to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and drunk by luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or just go right.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally tough fight against the descent."
The “most important task” is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king-class performance in the daily life of the league in Mainz.
And the completely newly revealed weaknesses after the fast three goals by Marica (5), Träsch (8), and Pogrebnyak (11).
Exposure
The Champions League eight-finals (16/17 + 23/24 February / 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be played in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the fulminant condition of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only with the alleged healer, who had given the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time confidence, preparedness and joy of play.
I approached the players and told them to recall their strengths, and I stopped them from being more courageous, soul clamper Gross explained the so-called simple recipe for success, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann admitted, “When a new momentum comes in football, sometimes things happen that you’t have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who advanced straight to the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury break thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new supervisor works: "He is a man who strikes through and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel it was obviously mixed up.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports board member Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs Constance.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a replacement weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They would have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came to mind, Khedira said.
And sports board member Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal has been achieved, the other is still far away.
We are not above the mountain yet.
That Heldt was not happy to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which lived fresh in the form of a television interview broadcast immediately before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of directors of weak leadership and decided to change coaches on the pressure of puberty fans.
Even that his free day was cancelled after games, Lehmann viewed as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann’s statements were “shaped by pure egoism,” Heldt rejected and announced consequences for the final man.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with all the others that without the preparations of the removed coach team the playful and fighting-strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have “a big share of the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said unisono – and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM Fight in Heavyweight
Heated duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old champion according to the WBC version defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
It was Klitschko’s third successful title defense since his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian has been twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the K.O., which everyone expected.
Klitschko broadened his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to beat himself due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2,02-meter-high Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight primarily with his left leading hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, repeatedly avoided the world champion's beats, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous right to the goal decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who crossed the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some twists before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie" who "can do nothing right."
During the weighing, the champion then provoked Johnson on Friday to push his sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had then beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "raised" his WBC belt, which he had to give away without fighting before.
This year, he then defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I lost only one blow in this fight and I am physically in very good shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains to unite all four major titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt, however, is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to destroy the 2.13-foot Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a September match against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
It is said that his promotional company is already planning to fight Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Case of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left are demanding information from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings about the Kunduz air strike, the opposition has alleged Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister has "consciously said the untruth" about the deadly bombardment of two tanklast trains in September, Greens group leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau".
It’s called country: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in disregard of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped vessels, but also about targeting the killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or wounded, according to a NATO investigation report.
The Greens, SPD and Left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately comment in the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor’s office has not influenced concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the ministry’s presentation of the reasons behind the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanklaster attack.
Officially, it said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied the minister sensitive details.
The two senior officials, however, that they had even pointed to several reports from the Defense Ministry, including a two-page document from the commander Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter to clarify the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received a response, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Bundestag’s investigation committee, which will be formed next Wednesday.
Traumatic
Some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the mental illness and in the drug rumor that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to surrender ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and images of imagination.
However, those who experience traumatic states while awake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are mostly considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a special person.
However, such images and voices do not only arise in mentally ill people or in the drug noise.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Traumatically altered states of awareness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic abductions, psychoses and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain's neuronal messengers - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disrupted and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of delusion and dream has been concerned with philosophers and doctors since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the wakeful state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disagreements, delusions, sensory alterations of one such".
It’s autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power over him anymore, he floats on the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted scratches, flattering teeth.
They chase him, hit him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout his body.
Loud, malicious voices sound from the walls and radio.
He can no longer endure them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo system, knots them into a string and attachs them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a speaker and puts the rope around his neck.
and jump.
The snare resolves.
That is to be a lesson for you, the voices shout in a drum-shaped choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressed, he is taking medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
Images are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common condition after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected usually can no longer distinguish between the internal and external world, they fall into a state of over-excitement, which can lead to hallucinations, greatness, relationship or persecution madness.
Particularly common is voice listening – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centric, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of what is happening, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he falls into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Thus, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A comparison of reality is usually not possible for them, the false images are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in dreams, Fuchs says, “but the sensory and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved.”
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations originate in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real frame.
Why exactly our brains strike caprioles, researchers still raise a mystery.
Exceptional circumstances can cause any person to lose reality for a short time, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers believe that there are minimal brain damage among those affected.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself over many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübecker psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deception for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Irreal World in Our Heads".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also of a surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and skull trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to caste, are made up of memory content that is normally retained.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or inhibited too little; when our brain runs hot or also when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of irritation, stress, love scourge or other mental emergencies.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A normal girl, in fact.
If there weren’t the pictures and the voices.
During the break, it may happen that a slender boy with long, dark hair will appeal to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a dull daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other false images are not real and disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are usually scary.
Often, images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the subject matter because the teacher is presenting a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while explaining mathematical equations hearing and visible to everyone else at the table.
At night, the phenomena are usually scary.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees are the scratches or the girl with the bleeding incisions on her arms and legs, before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
She doesn’t tell her parents or friends that she would think they’re crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Madness is also an artwork of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritable deprivation, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect that the brain is then underoccupied and takes care of its entertainment itself.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls daddy since she can think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that also process real impressions and sounds, people like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between false images and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nightly dream images value casting as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
The border between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, suffering illness, but it also contains positive, creative - madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically altered awareness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced believes to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the state of awareness even in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness develops in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in patients with polyradiculitis who experience motor paralysis at full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by loss of self and the world, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Because dealing with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intense form of sensualization and sensualization in an insupportable situation, which allows us humans with our own capacity to design not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Even the Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to immobility at the intensive care center.
Claussen plunges into a self-made world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedlord, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lived in the early Middle Ages among nobles who made drugs from blood.
Kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle in his homeland, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It goes completely into the imaginary happening, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from every dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are clear to me even after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense than actually experienced.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug rumors show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
This is an experience that can also be enriching.

Children should take over the publishing at 27 years old
The new chief publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his business into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding will continue to belong to the family at 100% in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long run.
Both children inherit at age 27 and have a firm will to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
You can’t give your children to 7500 employees if they’re not skilled enough.
It kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would resign from the board of directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
He was initially responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury department, the responsibility for the corporate assets was added and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also the responsibility for direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
This is the first time that no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Callen also serves to "bridge over 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of schickdance and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family are not safe from collapse: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought they could thus rise to the very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “world power dreams,” Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with Time, these shops have become too big.
The perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, who recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about body care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find, among others, prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide laser hair removal; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoying a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to put your own “beauty party” on your feet with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many options that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, in addition there are also virtual trainers who take care of the customer’s training sessions and thus provide them with a completely personal training.
One starts a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are perfectly enough to train the body muscles.
And if you still want to visit the hair salon after you have trained your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments are offered to restore the gloss, gloss and health of your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the heart of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 a.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decomposition
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it’s another great opportunity to copy the stars’ appearance and bring their wedding dresses to our closet.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the “LIVE office” together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the Introduction of the Electric Car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transportation of the future.
3 “electric cities”
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of electric cars.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include, among other things, those related to energy and in particular to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative Endesa participates in to promote the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups across Europe and hasined a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicted a “horizon of tranquility” for the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country’s largest exporter.
When presenting the 2009 economic report by the Prime Minister, Zapatero recalled the measures the government has taken to support the automotive sector during the government year.
“Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of neglecting and cutting down some of our main production plants,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automakers to continue to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the prosperity of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided €800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided for investments of more than €3 billion.
The head of government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the measures taken by the government to boost demand, in reference to the Plan 2000E, which is implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and automobile manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan will allow the emissions of the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a “strong increase” in approvals, which increased “by 40 percent” in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sports
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine in the Mazda3 model, dubbed i-Stop, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good scores in the overall picture.
The final processing, the performance of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are “very good” in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The game of the wheel is also excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the dashboard and dashboard, you can see that with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue, Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to outperform.
The passenger space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more comfort than ever before, so that four adults can ride the car most comfortably.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped luggage compartment.
The stop-and-acceleration system is so far only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its subtlety, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with a gasoline engine due to its great comfort at the gearbox and its low consumption, even though in Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sporty model selected for the test ride is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment stands out mainly the RVM, which eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inner mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch folds.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it were not enough, the Premium package, which for an additional € 1,500 includes the following: in addition to other elements above all the Bixenon learning-capable headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behavior and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which ranges between 21.770 euros for the luxury model and 23.270 euros for the tested model Sportive.
However, in exchange for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pleasure every day.
A show with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that allows you to only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or browse the internet.
It its five minutes of fame when it selected Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest especially to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very affordable flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee for the phone, approximately 12 euros per month, includes roaming across Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to be able to read their emails once you cross the border or when you are desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flat-rate roaming is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for overseas stays, but according to my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the small printed.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (while it’s surprising that it’s called Fon, even though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariffs means that phone providers need to slowly but surely change their minds and start considering different ways to use their data networks.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without hooks and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely at the time of purchase, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a lifelong internet access shopping option that Peek already offers in the U.S.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The colour of Michelle
Yellow is the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his undoubtedly most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: in addition to being almost the same color – a shiny grey-yellow – the clothes consisted of three parts – dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric – and in addition she wore something rough-shaped or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from the top and in Oslo one from the samurai.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a bright model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different each time: the hair was raised as a hair crown on this occasion, and on the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and Careers of Women in Spain", conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women find their career opportunities on the labour market limited due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are huge differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children depending on whether the women are working or not and, if so, what kind of profession they are exercising.
Those of them who do not do any other activity outside the house, only work half-hours or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, delay the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
“The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed employment have their first child on average only 3.7 years after the withdrawal, a figure that rises to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who took longer to this and who joined and realized the first child only much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a big impact on maternity, although less than the calendar in terms of conception readiness,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account with the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years old, depending on whether they only have a primary school degree or higher education, were on average 25.1 or 32.1 first-time mothers each.
There are also differences between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with a primary degree get married before their first fixed employment and have their first child, women with a middle or high school degree do it quite differently and first look for a fixed employment and then get married and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envious list of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it."
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on the international level, will thus become another famous poster as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (“Grey’s Anatomy”) and Matthew Fox (acting co-star of Evangeline in “Lost”).
British Fashion Industry Awards
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both of yesterday and today – met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they all appeared.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Ace" (Alfaguara, depictions by Fernando Vicente) to the three-way X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
In doing so, he does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a resemblance to the burning heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent doesn’t spare any horror or enlightenment.
Despite the fact that this book is a delicious reading delight, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
Albert Camus wrote: “As I read his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in opposition to the miserable destiny, the morality without guilt, and the innocence without any God.”
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife that would have almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was seduced by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege consisting of coming to heaven by the way of corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.It is one of the 8000s peaks in world literature, you have to climb the northern wall, the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: “It was a weird deal.
He sometimes said of himself that he would be the heir to a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams indicated a certain greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the crazy scream cried out from a bridge from that Munich personality so that his echo would be echoed to the night of the twentieth century in his literary way.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed, my venerable God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb are engraved these Spencer verses: 'the sleep after the effort, / after the storm of the harbor, / the rest after the war, / after a full life you find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression with her.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the Azaleans or the birds were singing in Greek.
There is no other known case in which the man was so patient and in love with a neuroscientist whose literary talent was far greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do other than try to get Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not lead Baroja to Faulkner’s weapons?
So what did Cela do except to destroy that man’s fame so that he could stand on this podium himself?”
cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed animal that we brought from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then from the clear sky they missed him two footsteps and wounded him seriously.
Our indignation cannot be expressed in words, because it is incomprehensible to us where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was executed on the rope.
In addition to this, a woman who went for a comfortable walk had an asphyxiation attack when she wanted to justify those people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because when such a madman attacks a dog, he may do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we filed an indictment at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts that this will bring anything at all, and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation over what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what is going on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people have left.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly to use the helmet
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to highlight the importance of helmet wear, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries and even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “includes much more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer every day” and reiterated that it also contributes with other actions of an educational and informative character to bring this goal a step closer every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of motorcycle helmets, which runs under the slogan ‘To be or not to be’, will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops to the best possible dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" for the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, they always see a commitment that one of their main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
Small truck sales are rising again.
After almost two years, the small car market is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures should only be treated with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for the comparison are from November 2008, which was a poor year of departure with a 60 % decrease compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous fiscal year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the small car market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small cars, small trucks and lighter small trucks.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds on the sky are still the ones that affect the demand most, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the majority of the sales go to small and medium-sized companies, which in almost 100% of cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
Thus, to these restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions’ steady money spill, additional factors must be included, such as the rise in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a Plan 2000E vehicle has helped little.
This plan, however, is not only for individuals, but also for self-employed persons and small who want to buy a small truck up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded that it is imperative for the state to pay special attention to these small loads as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The automotive dealers’ association predicts a similar year for 2010 to the previous year, for which it expects a sales loss (in the case of passenger cars and SUVs) of 19%.
Support for braking in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the anti-blocking braking system ABS and as is now the case with the stability control ESP, emergency braking assistance systems must become a mandatory feature in European cars.
In fact, they are already compulsory for all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, and for the remaining vehicles a deadline has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union aim to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help prevent many accidents due to their functioning.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system detects on the braking pedal based on the braking strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure to the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not slowed off with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car passes during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are injured could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistants.
There would even be fewer accidents – one in four injury-related accidents could be prevented – once so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exercising a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver reacts, the system helps him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the Brake Assist applies maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While the staff at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American automaker points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the party concerned gives its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until early 2010.
GM said it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of those buyers could be Geely, which also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which has back coverage from the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing popularity.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some of its assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to shut down Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to beined.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis, but really managed to make it 80 kilograms lighter, bringing it now only 1,275 kilograms on weight.
To create such a thing, they first abandoned the automatic foldable roof, which was replaced by a tent wall roof with manual drive, thereby saving 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, like those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning system again 13; in addition, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thereby saving another 7 kilos; by installing sports bacquet seats again 12 times and with the light 19-inch reels again five saved.
Then, by abandoning the CDR-30 audio system, we had again lost six kilograms and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric, we had achieved the missing kilogram.
Although it’s also available with the PDK double-clutch gearbox, the test ride was carried out with a 6-speed hand gearbox, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very curved.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note without fault.
However, the reduction in his weight did not mean that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
The opposite is the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and lightweight model, but at the same time it gives you a sense of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the commands to rage, to brake, to recover and then again to get everything out of his engine ...
The car does everything we indicate to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering that is just as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of its V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is remarkably successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option as well as a system that can change the engine noises, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether standing out or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads we drove on the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car handled the hole well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track; and that though we found ice at dawn and roll split in some of these curves in the morning.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as there is probably quite rarely, and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EUR.
Bag girl
The singer, a busty friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the 'maison' fashion shows, she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than “Bad Girl” or “It Girl,” she is a “Bag Girl.”
The Baskonia gives themselves a victory in Israel
Despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, the Caja Laboral celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the grotesque performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even though they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Roots, who from the beginning sat at the top of the board.
As the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the playing field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the Álava team opted for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with pips and applause, which is his home, to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though Splitter’s “minus six” rating already liked to guess that this would not be the Brazilian’s best evening.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabeans wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the Yellow turning the wheel (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic’s team, injured, but all but dead, had to prepare a couple of match-safe games to get air again, and one of them suddenly came with Mirza Teletovic’s gun, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that a reassuring distance of (54-67) appeared again on the dashboard, which the hosts could adorn with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesians were blown up in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they honestly deserved in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was removed from the pitch because of fouls, Ivanovic’s team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game had already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to hand over the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and that in a game characterized by failures by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opponent team, which is one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game offered in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the unicaja even though the local team, with an in-game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, managed to make the scoreboard show in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which it would have almost come to a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and for which they were both disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to get warm and his superiority in both halves, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their players on the inside and Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
Hunting was impossible.
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to offset the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn swung the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the departure of the injured Scottish Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the lead and the triples of Cook and the effort of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, once it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket range, could not be stopped.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give up and had to give up the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out their salary they should earn based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of properties, job offers and cars in Spain.
The "How Much Should You Earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain.
Already a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average “feels poorly paid,” explains Albert Ribera, head of the Trovit product, in a press release.
The Spanish are the poorest paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spanish earns.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is that of a waitress with an annual net of €11,592; followed by the work of a seller with €14,725 and that of a worker with €15,667
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his term of office officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that he must have left the embassy before that date, where he had found asylum since September 21.
“He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27 as his term of office expires on that day and he will have to find a new home.”
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
Following the November 29 election (which won Porfirio Lobo) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he sought refuge in Brazil.
This, however, failed in Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the “de facto” government chaired by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to settle the debt by purchasing assets directly and indirectly to leave liquidity free at interest rates that move around zero, so that banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to scatter some sand into the gear as the BCE NEC has already done with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
That is why investors are questioning the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Exchange volatility and corporate bonuses differences are rising again, although they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and public debt rose again.
The U.S., Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this episode of instability so far, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened to lower Spain's rating with a new revision.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not hurt to silence the advocates of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among the leaders of world economic policy about what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of loans led to the loss of jobs, when they should have actually decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government that hides public debt, elections and a new government that pulls on the same string.
Prodi went to Berlusconi in Italy and Socrates to Durão Barroso in Portugal.
It makes no sense that Ecofin saves Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus admits a euro-member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens when extraordinary measures are needed to maintain the stability of public funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, ahead of an episode of normalization of the risk premiums, after some exhausts to too high amounts, that would now be within the expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the government debt differences increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences decreased and the Spanish increased further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
While the country’s advanced indicators force a large proportion of market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this promises not long life despite warnings.
Again, it seems like it’s an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, even though “be careful driving” is trendy right now.
Connected Branches
Ignacio Sánchez Galán, chairman of Iberdrola, was the first to speak before the Parliament’s sub-committee yesterday to discuss Spain’s energy supply strategy for the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by Gas Natural-Fenosa Chairman Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points on what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest €50 billion by 2020 and another €60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, mainly on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the premise of course by other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against that law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of any policy in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "this direction is clearly set in the long run, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the investment decisions should be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework needs to be created to address them.
Ferrovial receives Aer Lingus' handling in 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where it is represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The deal, for which no figures have yet been announced, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create an innovation center for smart infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest $20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to study the energy efficiency of motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The municipality intends to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for a public-private partnership (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly made up of European construction companies, competing with each other in the final phase.
The Transcity group is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in deep construction.
The team of Acciona will face the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure, and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium in the narrower choice is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction work and privatizations, but it has an obstacle to overcome as you only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy that the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and which the Spanish construction giants have yet to pursue.
ACS itself gained access to that market only by holding a 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of great importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm in Victoria (192 MW) and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, which is supported by the City of Brisbane’s Office of Infrastructure and will be called Northern Link (Nordzubringer), aims to connect the western highway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove by tunnel over a length of 5 kilometers (see map).
The roadmap issued by the city administration provides for the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll route is expected to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland contributes 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the funding.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is ready for big business.
Australia has repeatedly awarded significant contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government in the amount of 154 million.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiberglass cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-story King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane.The construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for it.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools over 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC Receives Order for a Tunnel in Slovenia for $64 Million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, the FCC has secured the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers long for a highway in Slovenia for the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the contract for the construction works to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has credited the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Ms. Rushmore’s agency for a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company said.
Mr. Rushmore was selected from among the 16 agencies presented to this competition, 4 of which went to the final round, including TBWA, which was responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
France Télécom has been fined more than $63 million for slowing off competition.
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom €63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed and mobile networks by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased as the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore become retroactive again.
The application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenue from transactions that do not come from the telephone connection.
Basically, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 for this network to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match in the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has evolved into a source of revenue for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, putting them in third and fifth place among the football clubs earning the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since their founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is ranked third in Europe to earn the most money from its participation and the only one to win the trophy three times alongside AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former 1992 European Cup occupies the fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money from their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third among the countries able to raise money through the Champions, although it has more titles than any other (five, as opposed to four by Italy, three by England and two by Germany).
Distributed
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated distribution procedure used by UEFA.
This fiscal year, the organization, which is chaired by Michel Platini, expects to generate revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, the UEFA provides 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation received 3.8 million through their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs who entered the eight-finals each receive three million; the four who entered the quarter-finals 3.3 million.
Each of the four receives 4 million.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each TV market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 seats allocated.
Last year’s champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers $61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group released details on the offer to buy shares with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (OPA) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be paid out for ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this postponement.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to notify them of their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
At a graduation, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the brink of possible bidding and the judicial quarrels of his former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created position directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all but free of controversy because the company is involved in a legal battle over suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the coming months.
Regarding the credit of the Salazar, yesterday former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the move of 212 million without knowing their destiny.
CNMV approves public exclusion tender for Paternina submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by investment company Mer for Federico Paternina on October 9.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it has approved this notice after it has been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the legal provisions and thus the contents of the declarative notice submitted, following the amendments of last December 2, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV also informed that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95% of the company’s capital consisting of 6.142.786 euros in shares listed on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Furthermore, it was also that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender and whose price was determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law.
New Vehicle Assessment Programs
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where an assessor must assess the damage incurred and the cost of repairs.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of systems.
Accident assessment and repair service and application providers collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are produced with their products.
The other two companies that compete with on the tool market for reviewing and preparing a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is all but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager at Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working with each of them to provide the information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed is growing, to the point that more versions, variants and engines have come on the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a tough task because every one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be cataloged and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a “smart” graphic image on which you can “click” different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a well-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months.At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet of vehicles on the roads, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical specialists) work simultaneously with three computer monitors.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
Developing this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, however, depending on the country, there are also tools for managing debris parts or for calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
By browsing through the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for accident assessment for assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the manufacturer’s estimated repair times or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each review.
The most expensive will be for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, one can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly tape only by the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the professional market, with which one can offer for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Their statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or for the purpose of obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to failures or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and in the same way provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Reviews is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 the turnover was EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The total worldwide turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's index.
Online auction of car accidents
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group purchased a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of €59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, assessors, car rental companies, workshops, garbage sites and car dealers who need to register before their activities.
Established in 1996 in Germany, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose passenger number has been registered can no longer drive on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
Cars of historical value, on the other hand, can be re-registered even if they have been discharged after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: Identifying the vehicle, finding the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The ease of handling these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graph of the respective model will appear and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts, and then they can print the cost estimate and pass it on to their customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
