Welsh AMs are concerned about "looking like a donkey"
Some AMs are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the organization to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs in various political groups are concerned about the risk of a downturn.
One member of the AM said his group was concerned about "the way it was going with Twp and Pwp".
For students from outside Wales: For Welsh twp means foolishness and pwp means bad smell.
Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and expressed different views.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party has said his plan is to change the name, but he noted that it was a shift in tone from the WP to the Mapettes.
In this sense, the letter w in The Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter w in Yorkshire English.
The Association Commission, which prepares its rules for changing the names, states: The final decision on how the members of the House of Lords are to be called will be the responsibility of the members.
A 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh House of Lords the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of its public consultations on proposals that received widespread support by consulting the organization through Parliament
In the case of the AMs, the Commission elects Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP recommendation has received much support during public consultations.
The AMs seem to be proposing further recommendations, but the effort to reach an agreement could lead to the Chief Executive, Elin Jones, heading the task, and is expected to write legislation on these changes within a few weeks.
The laws in these changes will include other changes to the operation of the office of the governor, including the rules for issuing AMs and the formation of cooperative committees.
The A.M.s will get the final vote on the question of what to call the bill.
Macedonians vote for a change in the name of the nation
Voters will vote on Sunday whether the country's name will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This popular vote was the result of decades of efforts to resolve a dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has repeatedly stressed that its northern neighbor's name represents the taking of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO
GHB The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is a strong opponent of the general election for a change of name, has said he will cancel the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is a price to pay for membership in the EU and NATO.
The St Martin's Bells Ring during the Harlem Crusade.
 According to history, the elders I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner, said Mr. Adams
Today, there are no two.
He said that the barrel disappeared.
People see each other differently these days, he said
Bars are no longer public living rooms, where people go all the time.
For weeks, he was worried that the sale price would not last as long as the managers expected, and that he would soon or later return to where he started.
In addition, the church's position can be taken by the complex of houses filled with a variety of people who cannot help the protected areas of those communities.
Most of the people who buy condos in these buildings will be white people, he said, so soon the church will be closed completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who will enter these condos will be members of the church.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a major black city - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, and St. Martins a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation left the area in the 1930's.
A black congregation with a soldier nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a campaign to smuggle merchants into 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed black employment or development.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parish members made plans to rebuild the church, they set up a charm.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson at St. Martin's, proudly called the charon the "metal of the poor".
The master who beat the harlon with the Colwane called it another name: The Treasure of Travel and The historical drum with an unobstructed space.
Tiffany Ng, a professor at the University of Michigan, also said that it was the world's first black organ played by Dioniso A. Lind, who attended a larger organ at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not close his space.
What happened in St. Martins in the past few months has been a myth of architects and contractors, some brought by civic leaders of the congregation, and some brought by the Episcopal diocese.
vestri - the parish's governing body, composed of human leaders - wrote to the diocese in July complaining that the diocese would seek to transfer costs to the vestri, or that the vestri was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained that the Church of Christ was not openly involved.
A 13-year-old boy is injured in a car accident in California.
Shaka attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was begging for a ride in California on the opening day of the new rainy season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drinking with his friends for about half an hour on a Saturday morning when he heard a boy cry out for help and then jumped off with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was just fun to catch a fight, but then he realized that he was yelling, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
His entire shoulder was broken, Hammel said when he saw the boy.
I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: There is a waterfall! Hammel exclaimed.
The boy was airlifted to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was pronounced in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a shark had appeared in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not found to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was badly injured in a robbery.
Authorities blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but many are considered harmless.
Sainsburys' programmes are adding to the UK beauty market
Sainsburys takes Boots, Superdrug and Devenhams for granted with the beauty product lines full of professional assistants.
As part of the strong push to enter the UK beauty market of £2.8bn, which continues to grow as fashion and home goods sales are falling back, these beauty product lines will be tested in 11 stores across the country and confirmed in other stores next year if they are guaranteed to be successful.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelf space that has been taken up by law enforcement through TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsburys has announced that it will double its beauty products sales to 3,000, including the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
The LOreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees brands will also have additional space with branded spaces similar to those found in Shoes.
The supermarket is also re-launching a variety of Boutique brands so that most products are only for vegetarian consumers - a trend that is increasingly being sought by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop, which sells spices, is testing contracts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the daily shift in the number of small-scale grocery shopping in supermarkets mean that supermarkets are costly to invest in attracting people.
Mike Coupe, head of Sainsburys, has described the stores as growing in size and look like supermarkets as the chain of supermarkets tries to fight Aldi and Liddi who sell reduced prices by adding services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been adding hundreds of Argos stores and importing few Habitats since buying the chain two years ago, which is said to have increased the sales of the grocery and increased the interest rate.
The former efforts of the supermarket to revive its beauty and pharmaceutical industries failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots in the early 2000s, but the meeting ended after disagreements over how to distribute the proceeds from its pharmacy in its supermarkets.
The new plan came after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical businesses to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m, three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of high-end skin care products such as Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Manager at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty products to improve the quality of our customers.
We also invested in special training partners, who would be available to give advice.
The various branded products are designed to meet all our needs and our attractiveness and the convenient environment means that we are the best end-user for beauty products that directly address the traditional shopping tradition.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby is out of a £11 million deal.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den has gone mad at us following Holly Willoughby, a TV show host, withdrawing from an £11 million deal with her brand's lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home products or any associated Truth brand.
The two's business was likened to the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old founder of This Morning went to Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the top of the Dragons Den, Peter Jones, who managed to exit their high-end lifestyle brand minutes before - to take time to get his hot money deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The researchers said Jones was furious when the golden girl on TV admitted at a hot Tuesday meeting at her state-owned headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to local products of the True brand and its affiliates.
The business was likened to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's and was expected to double in value by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving the Truth, Jones flew in a hurry to one of his vacation homes.
Source: The Truth was the number one entry in Holly's list.
It would be a long-term future that would have had the opportunity to fulfill his purpose for the next two decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone involved in the matter shocked.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday, so close to the start of the work.
There is a store full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow that was waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the move of the dustbag from This Morning, one of Britain's most trusted brands, would cost the industry millions of dollars because of the cost of products such as mattresses and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and the delay in announcing the launch of the program.
And that was not the end of a long-standing relationship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truth with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as chairman on Thursday.
The couple took a vacation together, and Jones owned 40 percent of the films on Baldwin's TV.
Willoughby will take the place of Ant McPartlin as M&S's ambassador and host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
The parents who were close to Jones said that at night they were a shopkeeper, We couldn't put a focus on his business affairs.
We were so happy to meet each other.
He was not sure what the news might have said about the negative comments he made about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump said in his moderate voice be a media dust.
I have sacrificed nothing.
He noted that Kim wants a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in September was hailed by Trump as a step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the talk of nuclear non-proliferation has stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean envoy Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. World Summit on Saturday that the North does not see a consistent response from the United States to North Korea's previous arms embargo.
Rather, he noted, the United States continues to be a target for increased oppression.
Trump took a hopeful approach in his speech.
"We have good relations with North Korea", he said.
We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a close relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results - he completed rocket tests, helped free prisoners, and helped to restore the bones of Merika's soldiers.
He also defended himself by his unusual way of talking about his friendship with Kim.
It's not easy to take the presidency, but instead of 10,000 foreigners trying to get into a crowded stadium, we could have about 200 people standing there, Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian Tsunami and the Devastating Earthquake, which Killed Hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, in short, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
While more than a tenth of Lombok's population was evacuated, no emergency was announced, which is why the global outbreak was postponed.
Ms Sumbung said, "Unfortunately, in many cases, they were clearly aware that they were not seeking international assistance, so it is almost a challenge.
If Save the Children is still organizing a team to travel to Palou, it is not certain whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, told Indonesian officials that they were still monitoring the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to intervene in the efforts to spread the virus.
Considering the earthquake situation that Indonesia often faces, the lack of adequate preparedness to deal with the natural harshness of the country is a terrible thing
If tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely seen on the coast.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palou, even if the warning was in effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in good weather, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take three days or more to reach the newly affected area.
Mengamel Joko Widodo made the issue of infrastructure development the focus of his election campaign, and he also donated money to the construction of roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's lack of financial resources has left his government in a state of crisis as he faces a campaign rather than re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sectarian strife in Indonesia, where many Muslims have allowed themselves to practice a religion that does not support reform.
More than a thousand people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes during the street clashes between Christians and Muslims, using spears, arrows, and weapons of mass destruction.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a deep goal in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was handed the ball from Xherdan Shaqirin when he was 30 yards away from Chelsea's games with his team following 1-0.
He kicked the ball to his left before opening the goal and directing it toward the end of the pole.
The goal was lifted to the top of the box as it crossed the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell on Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was sitting on the net.
"It was an effort to get to the space, to get the ball and players like Shaq played as well as they could, so I tried to create enough time for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and touch her and she didn't waste time thinking about it and she shot him in the head.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the half after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian forward Eden Hazard.
The Blues' goalkeeper threw the ball into his thigh and returned it to Mateo Kovacic, before turning it through the middle of the field and running towards Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave up - and went back and forth across the court.
He then fired a beautiful ball, which led Hazard to put it in a box.
Hazard ran away from the back of the field, finished the game, and put his left foot into the net and passed it to Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's emergency services said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that triggered waves of more than 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palú, with a population of more than 380,000, was struck by a landslide caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of killing a woman who was beaten to death
An inquest into the murder has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged the local residents who saw or heard something to come forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have been shot in front of the traffic lights to contact us because they may have some important information about our investigation.
A police spokesman admitted that the woman was from the Birkenhead area and that she had been found inside the home.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the deceased came to the scene to ask where he was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police say they are still informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews recently tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
She was shocked to learn of the incident.
They were told that they would be allowed to return within hours.
A police officer is heard telling a man that the whole area has been declared a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
They repeatedly said that maye is terrible.
By 2 p.m. two police cars were inside the locked area rather than one car outside the area.
The young police officer was standing outside the locked area watching what was happening in the apartments.
Anyone with any information is requested to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers at 0800 555 111 anonymously, using log 247 dated 30 November.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has been transformed into a memorial with the sound of rewrite history
Their exile would be a legal boast in the destruction of many of England's pagan and religious images by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's view as foolish and attempting to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was necessary during this period of controversy to remove the photographs of Oliver Cromwell from the Westminster Palace.
The massacre of images and images of the English Civil War was neither directed nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's non-believer was not sacrificed for the actions of his grandfather Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's large exhibition of Cromwell is a 19th-century epitome of the artistic tradition and a classic of historical art that many believe should be commemorated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps in the 19th century and beyond, to be the parliamentary defender against external oppression, which he claims is a royal one.
That this is a complete and accurate account is a matter of ongoing debate.
The civil strife of the 17th century is known to have influenced the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is another representative of the other side of the universe.
His success as the Lord's Protector is well worth remembering and honoring.
A Pig Kills a Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reports said.
The man, known by his nickname Yuan, was found dead, with a blood clot in his left ventricle, near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reports the Sunday South China Norning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs into a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining Province, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the pigsty was opened nearby.
He reported that inside the cage was a large pig with blood in its mouth.
The coroner admitted that the 550-pound pig attacked and drowned the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin's legs were covered in blood and injured, said his cousin, known by the nickname Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Wednesday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was in custody for not attacking anyone, when the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market officials are reportedly still discussing the death penalty.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer on his stomach and his wife ordered him to drive it out by scaring the animal.
Following an Oregon farmer's pig feeding in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs rarely show a temper, but blood tasting could be the cause.
They are just games.
They are keen to explore, to explore, and to explore.
You should just give yourself the proper respect, he says.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa cause heavy rains in the southwestern United States
As observed, Hurricane Rosa is slowly gaining strength as it moves through the calm waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 85 mph, beginning at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and it appeared about 300 miles (385 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa likely heads north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave of winds has begun to form in the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward along the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja Peninsula in California on Monday as a storm, she will begin to blow a northward, humid wind into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring about about 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the humid continental air that meets the valley will cause torrential rains to spread throughout the Southwest in the coming days.
In that area, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause temporary flooding and landslides.
The extreme winds in the central part of the country will cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in select areas, particularly in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 3 inches is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Temporary floods may change the climate due to the extreme weather conditions in the center of the earth.
It is not wise to walk through the wilderness during the severe rainy season.
Heavy rains can cause a cliff to become a mighty river, and thunderstorms can cause strong winds and dust to melt.
The storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall to the southern part of California.
Over half an inch of rain may fall, causing severe flooding and slippery roads.
This will mark the beginning of the rainy season in that area.
The rainy season will begin in Arizona later on Sunday and early Monday, before raining in many areas on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will continue through the Four Corners on Tuesday and through Wednesday.
November may be a hot summer in the United States as the Arctic colder, but the central part of the country will remain warm.
This sometimes leads to a dramatic change in the temperature of the surrounding areas.
There is a striking example of a dramatic change in temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
There is an estimated 20 degrees Celsius difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer bud will try to grow and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is estimated to be in the mid-80s in October from the Southern Plains and other parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach as high as 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees Celsius above normal.
Long-term surveys suggest that temperatures in the eastern U.S. are likely to rise above normal in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the vivid testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault, reportedly in the 1980's, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued, as the media disrupted the regular broadcast of the latest changes on Friday: the agreement that Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona had to send the FBI to a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee to fully prove that Kavanaugh had dragged her into a drunken state and tried to strip her at a high school party.
In giving a thorough testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100% convinced that this did not happen.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people who reported on Nielsen on Friday watched the trial.
The company counted regular viewers on CBS, ABC, CNN, and Fox News and MSNBC.
Other news channels that broadcast the case were not immediately available, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure the number of people watching the news.
In a different way, the audience is likened to a football match or an Academy Award.
The Fox News Channel, which was a strong supporter of Kavanaugh's appointment, led to an estimated 5.69 million viewers watching the day-long trial, according to Nielsen.
The ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The enthusiasm continued to grow after the trial.
Flake was in the theater on Friday.
After the Republican office issued a statement recommending Kavanaugh's nomination, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday and molested by robbers while attempting to ride a lift to the Justice Committee.
He stood up and stared down for a few minutes during the live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you", said another woman.
Do you think he was telling the truth to the people?
She was told that she was powerful when most women were powerless.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and that he would have more to say before the committee as the elevator closes.
Cable and full-time broadcasts were broadcast live for hours afterward, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to continue Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate.
But Flake said he could do so by agreeing that the FBI would review the charges filed next week, which were being promoted by a handful of Democrats.
Flake was very satisfied with the interview with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat.
After consulting Coons and other members of the Senate, Flake made a decision.
The vote of Blake was a powerful one, for it was evidence that Republicans would not have the vote to pass Kavanaugh's election without a poll.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister PM May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her exit from the European Union of "political manipulation" of Britain's future and of "undermining national aspirations" in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party summit in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 November 2018.
In one close interview with his colleague on the front page of the newspaper, his foreign minister Boris Johnson pressured him to attack him with his so-called Chequer deal plan for Brexit, continuing to say that the British and EU's motivation for financial negotiations  makes no sense
Police arrested Dyteon Simpson in the death of an LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a violent brawl that resulted in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was also arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The police released a video of Sims and Simpson's eye contact, and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The mirrors were found by police at the scene and tested to find Simpson's DNA, according to a WAFB report on CBS.
After police questioned Simpson, the police said that he admitted to shooting him to death.
According to the prosecutor's report, his bond was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a report on Friday saying that his death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office is grateful for the cooperation of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for their hard work and compliance with the law.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the regular season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade told the team disappointed and sad about Wayde's death.
"That's what's always bothering us", Wade says.
A firefighter sheds ash in Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano during its high-altitude eruption and to emit up to 183 volcanic eruptions in a 24-hour period.
The assembly was in the midst of a series of thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Images taken by social media showed a pile of ashes that covered the windows of cars in neighboring areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Climate scientists have observed an increase in the volume of the volcano, which has been located some 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the Mexican mainland in November 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been erupting since 1994.
Police meet the separatists in the air ahead of the independence day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-freedom protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands added their anti-apartheid vests as a reminder of Catalonia's vote to end segregation.
The crowd of dissidents, who were blindfolded and surrounded by riot police, threw eggs and painted the pollen, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that often filled with visitors.
Later that day, the bond broke down when the police used their knives to fight the mob.
After a few hours, the crowd shouted  We will not forget, we will not forgive and faced the unity protesters and shouted, Spain stand still.
Fourteen people were treated for serious injuries, according to a local news source.
There has been a conflict in the region's ideological freedom for a year since the referendum on October 1 which seemed illegal in Madrid's eyes but is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Many voters chose to vote for freedom or even to vote for a lower number because those who opposed the concession simply voted.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year following a crackdown by police to stop voting in polling stations across the province.
Freedom fighters marched through the night on Friday to suppress the protest of the national police force.
That pressure continued, but it required a different approach.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrical engineer who joined the separatist movement with his wife, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year was a year of great success.
I saw my parents cry tears of joy because they were able to vote but now everything is fine, he said.
After winning by a landslide in the provincial election last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to keep up their momentum this year as some of their leading leaders either sought or blocked themselves while awaiting a verdict for the role they played in the referendum that followed the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who photographed the protests on her cell phone to support the police, said the clash was fueled by political activism on both sides.
The situation is getting worse, he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who had been detained before trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
Joining the European elections is the best way to counter the neglect of democratic values and oppression we have seen in the Spanish government, he said.
London: Arrested after a car hit a house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a car hit a house in London.
The incident occurred on Wednesday at 19:30 BST in the Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building were damaged.
The car may have been shot with a bow.
Menga kicks the ball that gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
First goal Dolly Menga scored for Livingston who gave them a win
Livingston's promotion surprised the Rangers by keeping Steven Gerrard out of the second 18-game losing streak as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's ball was a spectacular opening for Gary Holt's team as they tied for second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is still undefeated in the Premier League this season and facing the Hearts ahead with eight points, next Sunday.
Until then, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to lose six games in the division, and head coach Holt has yet to hear the loss since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing out on opportunities to play with visitors
Holt's older team had to take the lead before scoring, and his leadership caused problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson escaped but slowed down his pace before scoring, and Alan Lithgow was there to direct his pace further after he hit Craig Halhett's headball in front of the court.
The welcoming guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they might occasionally torture the guests.
The decisive victory goal was scored.
Rangers allowed an unstoppable goal and Livingston worked to open the gap, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson met to prepare Menga, who touched the goal and hit the inside of the box.
In that season, the Rangers were still in charge of the ball but found that the home-field players who were behind the goal were not coming in and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was very worried.
The same thing happened in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's goal to be stopped.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Alan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow interfered with another game in Livingston.
There were many balls in Livingston's box that were just thrown away, and the two penalty kicks - followed by Halkett's challenge to change Glenn Middleton, and one to catch the ball by hand - were just passed.
It's amazing about Livingston - say the critics.
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A spectacular performance that had a positive effect on Livingston.
To a mere human, they were warriors, who always went on to do more than they could in the way.
Their playing style and behavior have not changed since they returned to their flight, but the praise must be passed on to Holt in the way that has shaped the band since his arrival.
He had many wounds.
Halkett, the team captain, was determined to make a high-profile defense, while Menga was not giving Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a break.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had a gun.
Because they were very good under Gerrard's direction, they were somewhat lacking in those standards.
Their final ball was a slow one - they could only open the game at home once - and this opened the eyes of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the points table.
Erdogan receives a bad reception in Cologne
On Saturday (November 29) the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was President Erdogan's last visit to Germany - a disastrous visit to restore relations between the two NATO members.
They are not interested in issues such as human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new and larger mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of ethnic Turks outside of a city in Turkey.
The police gave reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to the area to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - voiced their voice, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to admit him to the country.
The two protests reflect the divisive spirit of a visitor who is treated as a hero by the German Teku and is attracted to others.
Motorcycle accident in Deptford Motorcycle rider killed in a car crash
A motorcyclist dies in a car accident in the city of London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and arrived with emergency assistance, but the man died instantly.
The accident occurred months after a motorcyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on the Childers Road, just a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police have asked their busy partners to find out the man's details and inform his relatives.
The roads were closed, buses were diverted, and drivers were warned not to go there.
Long Lartin Prison Six workers were injured in a riot
Six prison staff were injured in a riot at a maximum security prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.
A riot is raging at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and the riot is still ongoing.
Special forces called the Tornadoes were called in to solve the riot involving eight inmates in one wing of the prison.
The police were reportedly injured in the face at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: Extremely trained personnel have been removed from the prison to deal with the HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six crew members were also treated for injuries.
Our prisons do not tolerate violence, but we know that those involved in the crime will be handed over to the police and may spend long periods in prison.
HMP Long Lartin is holding more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in a hospital and then attacked by a prisoner.
Then, in October last year, riot police were called to solve a riot when workers were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with severe flooding
The lowest winds in the tropics are rare in Arizona, but they may occur as the remaining intensity of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, causing severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstuff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, to watch for severe flooding on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa likely took the straight route through Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has noted in a report that ten tropical cyclones have formed by tropical cyclones or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was also a hurricane that moved more than 40 miles [40 km] from the border with AZ.
Recent models from the National Hurricane Center suggest 2 to 4 inches of rain, and up to 6 inches of rain on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Some areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1 to 2 inches (1 to 4 inches) of rainfall.
In those areas where there is no risk of severe flooding, rainfall with Rosa can be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, one of the rains may be helpful as the Southwest now faces a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona has experienced a second-degree drought, according to a report by weather.com
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa has led to landslides in various parts of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who was hit by heavy floods on Sunday morning and winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is about 385 miles (385 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north, and is traveling 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters calm waters in the Pacific Ocean and becomes weak.
So we are likely to arrive in Mexico on a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon.
Heavy rains in parts of Mexico could cause severe flooding.
Up to 3 to 6 inches of rain fell from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches, reports weather.com
Rosa will then look north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a calm wind, which will then move upward across Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The greatest threat to Rosa or her remains is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to bring severe flooding and earthquakes in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsommer Norton attack: Four men arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and a 16-year-old man was found with hearing wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found strangled in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital in a critical condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police have issued a public notice to anyone who may have a cell phone photo of himself.
Trump says Kavanaugh is the oppressor, the oppressor, and the angry leader of the Democratic Party
Vote for Judge Kavanaugh to vote against the brutal and vicious policies of the Democratic Party, Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been subjected to the harshness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the impeachment process.
Kavanaugh testified with force and compassion before Congress on Wednesday denying the accusations of sexual abuse made against her by Christine Blasey Ford in the past decades of her youth.
Ford also testified to the truthfulness of his accusations.
One Saturday the President said that the people of Merika saw Kavanaugh's wisdom, honesty, and courage that day.
The confirmation vote of Justice Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote of one of the most active minds of our time, a legislature with a long history of public service, told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a vague comment about Kavanaugh's removal when he spoke of the importance of the Republican Party's midterm elections.
Five weeks have passed since the most important decision of our time.
"I don't just run, I run too fast", he said.
That is why I have fought for the best candidates in many places.
Trump has called on Democrats to campaign against the ban.
The official vote to remove Kavanaugh from the Senate is likely to be made before Friday, a close associate of the GOP's top leaders told CNN.
Hundreds have died in the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and death toll seems to be rising.
More than 384 people died, many of them inundated, when torrential waves hit the beaches, and when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Saturday, officials said.
Hundreds of people were gathering on a beach in the center of the city of Palos on Friday when a wave of up to 18 feet [18 m] of water hit the beach at sunset, causing the lunar eclipse to sweep away the dead and destroy everything in its path.
The tsunami had a magnitude of 7.5.
When the tsunami started yesterday, people were still on the beach, without escaping and were being attacked, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian emergency services agency in a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not go alone, it swept away cars, trees, houses, hit everything, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was traveling over the sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in the city.
Aerial photographs taken by the emergency department showed buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn down and dismantled, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The remnants of the quake continued to shake the seaward city on Saturday.
The few earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported that the magnitude of the earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's landslide, which sits at the end of a long, red harbor, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extremely large" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the robbers were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that those in need of emergency relief and the damage may have been particularly severe in the coastal areas some 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, near the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said, the communication ended, with no news from Donggala.
There are over 300,000 people living there, Red Cross said in its report, adding that workers and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a bad thing, but it's getting worse, he said.
Many accused the agency on Saturday of not issuing a tsunami warning, or officials said the waves arrived shortly after the warning had been issued.
In an unpublished report, a man on the roof of a building is listening loudly to the warning of the coming tsunami to the people on the street.
In a few seconds, a wall of water hit the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the report immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage throughout the city, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the efforts.
According to officials, the military has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but survivors of the evacuation are still desperately in need of food and other necessities.
The airport is now open for air travel only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in the capital of the country on this occasion.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
It is a terrible situation.
Even if World Vision staff from Donggala arrive safely in the city of Palu, where they are hired to hide their heads in tents of shells set up inside their office grounds, passing through the images of destruction on the way there, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed, he said
It is a terrible situation.
Even when relief teams begin to rush to start emergency gear, some complain that international relief workers are being banned from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign workers, property, and money can be safely evacuated once a disaster area has been declared a national emergency.
That has not happened yet.
There is an emergency in the province only, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
If the government says, OK, this is a national emergency, then we can open up international aid but there is no immediate response.
When the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami arrived, the relatives and families of the victims were still holding on to the hope that their relatives would be miracles that would inflame the terrible news of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a polluted water well.
On Sunday, the paramedics rescued a woman who had been trapped in a pool for two days and her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesia national disabled ski team, was training two of the missing disabled skiers who were preparing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those locked up at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi was inside, among his students.
"As an elder in a skiing field, I have a responsibility to my spirit", he says.
Mr. Gendon reported how he sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, giving gifts to the disabled skiers who were part of the beach party.
His messages, however, were eventually marked with a fingerless marble instead of two green marbles.
I think that means that the messages did not reach the destination, he said.
Thieves took $26,750 when the ATM was filled in Newport, Levee
On Friday morning, the robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink employee when they filled the Newport-based Levee ATM, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was opening the ATM in the theater and preparing to make a donation, Det Dennis McCarthy wrote in the news.
While he was pursuing, a man ran after the servant and stole a purse of money that had to be returned.
Witnesses reportedly saw a few suspects flee the scene, but the police did not say how many were involved.
Anyone with any information about their identity can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: A reporter changes his name to Yes
The famous reporter Kanye West changes his name - to Yes.
announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: The formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known by the nickname "Ye" for some time and used that name as the title of his album, which was released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday's Night Live, where she is expected to announce the release of her new album, Yandhi.
She enters the arena of the show Ariana Grande, who has retired due to her air conditioning, said the show's creator.
In addition to the shortened name of his profession, West had previously stated that the name had religious implications for him.
I believe ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and the Bible says wena, means West earlier this year, when he was talking to the dust-colored Big Boy on the radio about the subject.
So I am you, and I am we.
It is from being Kanye, that is, the only one, to be Yes, the reminder of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
This album can remind you of who we are.
He is one of the few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he has announced his apology for using the names Love and Brother Love.
Another editor from West, JAY-Z, is content to include or not include hyphen and a few bold letters.
THE Mexican government vows not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to end the use of military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody school shooting.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military force to oppress the people of Mexico.
On 2 January 1968, the army opened fire on protesters in the plaza, killing some 300 people as student protesters marched through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young people in Mexico by providing scholarships and opening up public universities that are free of charge.
He said that the lack of employment and educational opportunities are attracting young people to gangs.
The U.S. should double the cost of AI.
As China's pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI) increases, the U.S. must double its research expenditure on this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an economist and computer scientist who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The name comes after various U.S. government agencies have issued announcements about AI, even though the U.S. has no official AI policy.
Meanwhile, China has launched its plan last year: to be No. 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
Doubling the AI research resources would be a good start, showing that some countries are far behind the U.S., and looking forward to another pioneer in AI.
Doubling the costs could double the chances of the next major AI success being in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who wrote his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order published this month by Houghton Miffin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which is the investor in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980's, at Carnegie Mellon, he worked on the AI program that won the top American Othello award, and later became the chief executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, so that he could identify the next developers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee says.
It's not China that's taking away the education leaders; it's the big companies, Lee says.
Facebook, Google, and other high-tech companies have been the focus of research from universities on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. improve its AI efforts.
I think residence permits should be issued to those with PhD degrees in AI, he said.
The State Council of China released its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of education in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to collaborate with industry and academia, and the White House presidential office building announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And in the same month DARPA announced $2 billion in funding for a new project called AI Next
And NSF, on the other hand, now spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legal system that is seeking to appoint a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no change in the past few months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country could change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would resolve its decades-long dispute with Greece that prevented it from applying for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the names of its northern neighbors represent a territorial dispute and therefore has banned it from entering NATO and the EU.
The two governments have signed a landmark agreement based on the proposed new name, but anti-nationalists say the change could undermine the national image of the Macedonian Slavic democracy.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the campaign has cast doubt on whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent limit required for the referendum to be legal.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Do you want NATO and EU membership that would allow Greece to sign a treaty?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that this is a price to be paid to continue Macedonia's admission to such organizations as the EU and NATO, which were among the countries that would rise from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I am here today to vote for the future of the country, and for the young people in Macedonia to live under the auspices of the European Union because it means safety for all of us, says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje.
Although it is not a legal obligation, enough members of parliament have promised to follow the results of the vote until a decisive decision is made.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority of the parliamentary vote.
The country's election commissioner has ordered no fraud reports to be issued by 1 p.m.
But the number of voters reached only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I'm out voting for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, filed a ballot paper for a referendum in Macedonia on the name change of the country that would open the way for it to become a member of NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 November 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting up a small seat in the tents set by the voters.
We are not NATO or EU, but we want to look up, not through the side door says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor nation, yet we have a reputation.
If they do not accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asia alliance.
Prime Minister Zaev said that becoming a member of NATO would bring about a much-needed economic recovery in Macedonia, a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens recommend the EU and NATO, Zaev said following his ballot.
He said that the result of the study could be a guarantee of our future.
A poll released by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters could be part of the referendum - less than the required number of voters.
In one poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma, 57 percent of respondents said they were willing to vote on Sunday.
Of those, some 70 percent would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 percent and one vote more.
The failure of the referendum represents the first serious blow to the policy of a pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City roams among all the Brighton backs and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly beat Brighton's back-rowers in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look as if he had scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker accepted the ball he was given on the inside of the pitch at the start of the games.
He ran between three of Brighton's back-up blocks, before reaching the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green caps.
He overcame one of the blockers before running away and leaving a few others at the edge of the Brighton box.
He then passed the ball to the left and got Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right boot.
Aguero has suffered leg problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That was the truth.
We were lucky that he scored a goal in that minute.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball in the middle of the stadium in Brighton.
He threw a beautiful ball to the left side and gave it to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the pole just before he pulled Sterling to the end of the pole.
The Sky Blues forward touched the ball and put it in the net before he pulled out of the lineup.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the game against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, there is no reason to force another team to play.
But Scherzer, a regular contender, hopes to climb the mountain on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, only if the Rockies, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game, still have signs of a playoff in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least a wild-card lead to beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but they are still looking to close their first-round game.
Even if we play for nothing, at least we can toe the rubber knowing that the situation here in Denver with the crowds and the other team may play at a higher level than I can see this year.
Why would I not want to compete?
The Nationals are yet to announce the start of Sunday, but it is reported that they may allow Scherzer to appear in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be doing his 34th concert, is scheduled to perform on Wednesday and again on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 2/3 of 220 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president spoke out about the situation regarding his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and discussed the importance of Republicans going to the polls in the midterm elections.
Everything we did was in danger during the month of November.
Five weeks have passed since one of the most important decisions of our time.
This is one of the biggest, the biggest -- I don't just run but I really run, so I go to many places and fight for the best candidates, he says.
Trump went on to say, "You see this bad Democratic party, these terrible changes, you see what's happening right now.
And they are willing to restore power to them by using all the necessary means, as you see the cruelty and injustice.
They do not care who they hurt, and who they can run to for power and authority, but we will not give them that which they want.
The Democrats, he said, are in the process of opposition and repression.
And you see that in the last days, he says, they call the Democrats angry and cruel, wicked and untrue.
He named a senior Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who removed complaints from his audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Would you dislike the book?
What is U, U, U?
No, no, I represent one - those were the marks of a bad body language - a body language I never saw.
Labour is no longer a big church.
He is not tolerant of those who express their opinions
When the Momentum gang members in my group voted to criticize me, I was not surprised.
Let them know that I am on the Labour MP list and that they will be told that we are not welcome - all because we are talking about our own interests.
My partner in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she resisted the criticism of Jews.
In my case, the motive for the criticism was to blame me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of a sound economic policy, national security, Europe, in a way Jeremy disagrees with former leaders on such issues.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday noted that we want these meetings to be non-discriminatory and effective.
For many years I have been a Labour MP, and this is what GC meetings on Friday nights have been.
Sadly, today, it is not the way it sounds and the promise of a compassionate, gentle, old age of politics has been lost, if it ever had been.
It has become clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate any differences and that any opinion is judged by the party's leaders.
This began after Jeremy became the leader, as my colleagues, whom I thought we had a similar political view, began to see me as a close supporter of what I would never agree with - national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly - no matter what I say - following the abuse and abuse of the Internet that demands a vote, and abandoning the political system, I am told that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
I am not alone.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than my peers because these conversations are often political.
I am amazed at the quality of work and the zeal of those couples who face the sheer amount of bullying every day but never give up.
One of the most discouraging crimes of this political era is the fact that the racial segregation has become a common practice.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote tolerance.
We are not really a big church beast and the group is declining because of all the movements to be trusted or changes in the law.
I have received many tips over the past two years that have encouraged me to bow my head, not talk and that will all work out.
But that is not my political agenda.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, suffering the Thatcher government's abandonment of my classroom, I have been seeking to be the first to seek better public services for those in need - as a local councillor or government official.
I did not hide my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East seemed to be confused about my goals and the parts I disagreed with the leaders present.
To those who campaigned for the Friday movement, I can only say that as the world continues to grow in poverty with Brexit that will damage homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy being loyal to the Labour leader.
But in fact, my message is one that I have not directed to the Nottingham Momentum, but is directed to the audience, whether they are Labour or not. I reproach myself for serving you and I promise that no threat of election or political urgency will divert me from doing what I believe will benefit you all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr lead
The two recent attempts may have been somewhat of a disappointment, but Ayr certainly deserved to win the most exciting Tencent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the list, and only the top ten are undefeated.
Eventually, it was their strong defense, such as their catch, that took away the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We've had our games tested so far, and we're still not defeated, so I should be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: "May the glory be with Ayr, they have better chances than we do.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute effort, which was overturned by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, however, captain Rory Hughes' yellow card, which was drawn by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk numbers and Jason Baggot to take the unchanged lead.
Climo extended Ayr's lead by a penalty, before, in the first half, he scored the only goal that turned the single-player effort into a 17-5 victory over Ayr in the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's effort, which Baggot responded to, narrowed the lead by five points.
A long-term standoff resulted in the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was stripped of his frame, and when he returned, Ayr made progress with the efforts of Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the vice captain of the Ayr, was given the card, and Melrose paid a man for Bruce Colvine's unanswered efforts.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given the card for chasing Climo without the ball, he removed it from the line of the pin, Macpherson touched the back of Ayr's coming-out shield.
Clima repented, as he did again when he returned, and then Kyle Rowe picked up a box kick from David Armstrong and sent Gregory Henry away from home for the fifth time.
Still Game's goal is to find work in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears determined to enter the hospitality industry after being named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he wrote and recorded with longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that this series of nine would be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for life beyond Craiglang.
According to a official listing, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although reports from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan was looking to enter the business of growing restaurants in Glasgow.
Our sea: Bolivia, a foreign nation, hopes that the court will reopen the Pacific route
The sailors guard the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The national buildings fly a green flag like the sea.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are filled with the slogan: The sea is our legal possession.
It is also a job.
Across the country's bordering Bolivia, the memory of the economic exploitation of the coastal areas that Chile took over in the 19th century after the bloodshed is still bright in the mind - as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope is at its highest decades later, when Bolivia has been in the midst of a five-year-long process of appealing the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on January 1.
Bolivia still has a spirit of unity and peace, and it looks forward to the results it sees coming", says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's representative.
Bolivians watched the ICJ's rally on television nationwide, hoping that the Hague court would agree with Bolivia's claim that - after decades of negotiations - Chile was forced to negotiate an agreement to give Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a well-spoken Bolivian president - who is up for re-election next year - is also looking forward to Monday's rally.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court may not uphold Bolivia's case - and that if it does, little can be changed.
The United Nations congregation in the Netherlands has no authority to override the borders of Chile, and it has declared that it will not issue the results of any talks that may be held.
The fact that the ICJ's ruling came just six months after the talks ended shows that the case was not a "tricky one", says Paz Zarate, an international law expert.
Instead of advancing the goals of Bolivia, it has moved backwards over the past four years.
The issue of access to the sea has been transferred to the current state of Bolivia, Zarate says.
The warlike morales of the Chilean people have taken his mind off the public's interest.
There will be a time when Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be much more difficult to give talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, has denied the idea that the court's decision has been unusually expeditious.
Monday will provide Bolivia with an unusual opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end a 139-year period of disagreement over the benefits of both, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is now one of Latin America's most famous presidents - had used the sea as a political tool.
 Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, furthermore.
This is an opportunity to see that we need to pass on the latest.
North Korea says nuclear weapons are impossible without trusting the United States
North Korean prime minister Ri Yong says his nation will never put down nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the International Conference.
He ordered the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore convention between the rival leaders.
He noted this when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to resume his nuclear mission, which had been suspended three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that any dream that the United States' continued crackdown on the Korean War's declaration will defeat Korea.
Washington will not agree to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes decisive action to lay down its arms.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted another meeting.
But there is little doubt that Pyongyang is determined to abandon what the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show a new type of fashion on the highway to the nearest high street
If you want to increase your conversation or to keep your eyes open, you can't look at the sun.
Fashion designers Valentino and Tom Browne have unveiled a variety of high-end hats in their SS19 line at the Paris Fashion Week.
Incredible handmade hats have filled Instagram this summer and the designers have posted their eye-catching works on the cat-like trail.
Valentino's most striking, colorful work was a top-notch hat, decorated with feathers that quickly filled the heads of models.
Other major decorations include a sealed tortoise, a magic hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also advertised a talk about the use of fancy masks - and they came in handy for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipstick faces and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One was like a swimsuit, a full-length breathing tube, and a blindfold, while the other was like a jar of melted ice cream.
If you keep on making big fashion statements - you're in luck.
Fashion viewers suggest that the big hats may be on the way to the high streets near you.
The large hats follow the waistcoats of La Bomba, a two-piece sundial that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The religious label of the cloak under the old hats that was circulated on all social networks sent another work to the way - a woven beach bag that was almost the same size as a model dressed in a bathing suit we carried.
The orange-colored purse, with a rounded edge and a leather handle, was the highlight of the SS19's performance at the Jacques-Mousso La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
A well-known expert, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing huge hats and beach bags hit the high streets next summer - as the designer has made it difficult to keep up with demand for hats and other items.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for people around the world
Scotland's private schools have a long history of excellence in education, and this has continued throughout 2018 with outstanding results, only reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide students and parents with quality services.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for their own choices of careers, and for their position as global citizens.
Like an education system that can create and launch its own curriculum, we see the current curriculum becoming a popular and desirable subject for schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to a man in a language you can understand, it goes to his head.
When you speak to him in his language, it touches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we must not rely on English to build friendship and trust with foreigners.
From the recent results of the year, we can see that languages are higher in the list of subjects than the highest achievement rate in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received a Grade A.
Statistics compiled from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of students have passed the A-level, while 72 percent of those who have studied German, 69 percent of those who have studied French and 63 percent of those who have studied Spanish have also passed the A-level.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as their choice of subjects, are now seen as being in the same category as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for the lack of job vacancies were linked to a lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are increasingly being forced on young people to prepare for future jobs.
As job opportunities for languages increase, these skills are needed worldwide.
Regardless of the career choice, if you learn a second language, they will be better off tomorrow by having the same skills for the rest of their lives.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will easily put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent were not fluent enough to communicate in a foreign language, while French was the only language spoken by 15 percent.
That is why cultivating language skills is so important to young people today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will equip children with great opportunities for successful employment.
Within Scotland, each school has a different language.
Some schools will also be dealing with current languages, while others will be teaching languages that will be seen as important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
In accordance with your child's wishes, there will always be a few languages to choose from in private schools, with teachers who are trained in this field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing an environment that will train children to develop the skills they need to succeed, regardless of the outcome.
There is no denying that in this global business climate, languages continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of the world, and this must be demonstrated in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as ability for global communication.
Private schools will continue to provide opportunities for choice, separation and improvement for young people in Scotland.
It is necessary to do so.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for LeBron James to join his Los Angeles Lakers lineup is about to end up with his fans.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener against Denver in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the time limit is still set.
It will be more than one minute and less than 48 minutes, Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James might play shortened minutes.
Following a pre-season schedule, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the season began.
I don't need pre-season games to be ready for this stage of my career, he says.
The Trump Administration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump's first of five rallies is scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to publish his decision to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court suspended, Trump intends to increase support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress during the November election.
What time is Trump's train tonight, and how did he watch it on the Internet?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for 7 p.m. ET on the evening of November 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using a YouTube feed.
Trump may be speaking about the hearing this week of the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanaugh, who was heavily accused of sexual misconduct, as the Senate press vote is suspended for about a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of the money-laundering was to help Republicans who faced the difficult election in November regain their momentum.
So President Trump's campaign has announced $5 next week aimed at increasing the power of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Control of Congress is critical to the president's plan to visit as many provinces as possible in the face of a busy campaign, said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to comment, told Reuters.
Slated to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's rally could bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get broadcast on Pittsburgh radio, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, a state that won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump attempted to win the Republican nomination for Senate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who was left behind by a landslide.
It is not a good indication for Morrissey that no president will try to raise him to the polls, says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show pride in fighting for the prospects of Sunday's hosts
After three crazy sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what the Ryder Cup needs.
The rotating torque response is a fictional concept of a sport that the players really believe in, and it is beyond the reach of a competition like this
But where is the enthusiasm now?
"They were six points ahead but now we're four, so we're carrying that as a little bit of a push", Jordan Spieth said as he walked slowly that day.
Europe is in the lead, four points ahead and 12 points behind.
Americans, as Spieth put it, are windy and have plenty of incentive, unlike Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play all day long and each score three out of four points
Spieth was a dangerous man from start to finish, and he leads by example.
That loud shout of joy grew as his leg continued to grow, and he missed the important fourth-place game when he and Thomas were two-thirds behind each other.
His winning goal in the 15th game was met with the same cry, one that said he believed the Americans were not out of the game.
You have to be down to think about your game, Spieth says.
That's all the players have left.
The 18 holes are marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable record for the Ryder Cup.
These two European men are rare but lovely and they are the fourth most likely to do anything wrong
Moliwood were the only two who did not pack a bag on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bags on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and 9pm on Friday morning.
That pace, and their speed, helped the crowd to emphasize that the players were losing on Sunday, and that no other famous players could finish the possible European victory at Le Golf National by sunset than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both can be better at the same time on different walls.
However, it is not yet time to discuss European art.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were briefly working on Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball champion, when they were arrested along with Alex Noren.
A bag and two bowls at the front held the Spaniards and Swedes in a pit that they could not escape.
On Sunday, though, you will not be able to get out of your hole.
Watching four-balls close by is a fascinating experience because of the combination of two moves, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give, and how the strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe have played better as a team so far and are still very much ahead of the last day but the foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the military strength of others, especially the United Stateside, were skeptical.
Euorpe leads 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have the best hand to beat in the Ryder Cup final sunset after winning the four-ball and four-ball games 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, had a double lead lead over Tiger Woods, who had been hard to match so far in Le Golf National by four points.
The European side, Thomas Bjorn, who wants to keep the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, took the lead by beating the American side in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The United States showed a struggle in the foursomes, winning two games, but they refused to lose.
Jim Furk's side needed eight points in 12 games on Sunday to finish the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rider to score four consecutive points, and he and the Monarchs scored Moliwood following a stunning weekend, the only two to score four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball and went on to beat the outcast Woods and the outgoing Merika-based Bryson Dechambeau by a landslide victory of 5 to 4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed good form but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fouralls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, after a break from the morning fourballs, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepa - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe was not able to get what it wanted on a cool, sunny day southwest of Paris.
With three major victories, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas watched the Merikhas score a two-point mark on Saturday.
They won 2-1 on the screen defeating Jon Rahm and Ian Pouter of Spain in the fourballs and then again later to defeat Poulter and Roy Mcllroy 4&3 in the foursomes following a two-hole loss.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team come back from a four-point deficit, or as in the previous Furyk side, they only need to balance to keep the cup.
But after two days of retaliation, Sunday's retaliation seems to have been beyond their control.
North Korea says cha by putting down its own weapons without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued escalation of the war has increased confidence in the United States and that there is no way the country can stop its nuclear weapons from being in such a state.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual World Summit, the General Assembly, that North Korea had taken "very peaceful steps" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, restoring nuclear testing facilities, and committing to not increasing its nuclear facilities and technology.
But we don't see such practices in the United States, he says.
Unless the United States is trusted, we will not have the authority to protect our country and in such a situation we will not be able to put our own weapons first.
While Ri has echoed North Korea's similar complaint that Washington has slowly blocked the way to eliminate nuclear weapons when North Korea is not rewarded for its actions, his speech has been clear that it has not just failed to put down nuclear weapons as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri presided over a speech delivered by Kim Jong Un to Donald Trump at their first meeting between the then U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 1, when Kim pledged to work to "stop nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea wanted to end the 53rd Korean War in 1950, but the United States had told Pyongyang to stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists on putting nuclear weapons down first and increasing the level of pressure by quickly achieving their goal in a compelling way, and refusing to declare an end to the war, said Ri.
The idea that we can be so blinded by our own thoughts is a mere fantasy.
But the problem is that the constant swallowing of our confidence increases.
Ri did not mention the thoughts of the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president noted earlier this week.
Instead, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If the nuclear disarmament issue had been the case of South Korea rather than the United States, nuclear disarmament would not have reached this stage of development.
However, Ri's tone of speech is much different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that referring North Korean rockets to the U.S. base would follow the bad President Trump's call on Kim as a suicide bomber.
At this year's UN, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much to be done and the North Korea would be ready to drop its nuclear weapons.
Somewhere on Wednesday, Trump said he couldn't set a time limit for this, saying that if it takes two, three or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia noted that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday: The Security Council's nuclear deterrence must continue vigorously and uninterruptedly to see the complete and verifiable end of nuclear disarmament.
The Security Council has increased North Korea's unilateral support since 2006 with the aim of delaying funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at a UN General Assembly summit and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in January with a good deal of progress, and within hours North Korea insulted him for doing the same thing to the criminals.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to renovate its missile and nuclear facilities if the Merika country takes similar steps.
He told Kim to tell him that he needed the same steps that Trump had taken to ensure security in Singapore, and to continue to restore relations with Washington to a normal state.
Harvard students take a lesson in getting enough rest
A new study at Harvard University has made it possible for all primary school students to get more sleep in order to slow the spread of caffeine-assisted learning.
One teacher has found that students at the world's top university know little about the basics of behavior and self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted a study that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the study and then to give a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation.
At the end of it, a young girl came to me and said: Why am I told this now that I am doing it for the last year?
She told The Telegraph that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - and I was surprised.
This lesson, presented at the beginning of the year, explains the basic elements of how good sleep habits help students to be successful in reading, playing sports, and improving their lives.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of clinical trials at the university, said the university decided to start the study only after finding that students were not getting enough sleep each week.
This one-hour study uses practical methods that involve you.
On one side is a picture of a crowded bedroom, where students print cups of coffee, curtains, stimulants, and books and are told about the effects of caffeine and light, that good sportsmanship can have a negative impact on lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep schedule.
In another part, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The university's map, with its buttons, encourages students to think about their daily schedule.
We know that we cannot change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the consequences of choosing to smoke in life, adds Professor Czeisler.
The practice of sleeping late at night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing demand for students means not getting enough sleep is a growing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, he says, it should be a hidden weapon for the student to control anxiety, fatigue, and restlessness - even gaining weight, as inadequate sleep deprives the brain, causing it to starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old biologist from California, helped the professor design and synthesize the study, and he joined one of his classes during his freshman year at Harvard.
He had his eyes opened to the lesson, which encouraged him to make the case for the university's entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all high school students to do a similar program before entering the competing university.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on an alarm to remind them when to go to bed and when to wake up, and keep abreast of the negative effects of the green light emitted from computer screens and LEDs, which can interfere with the body's balance along the way, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to knock Gerrard's boys down
Rangers The Rangers suffered a daytime game-breakdown when Menga's strike blocked Gerrard's undefeated side from a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first leap on their way since their 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager and left the side eight points behind the Heart of Ladbrokes Premiership who had lost.
Menga fired seven minutes into the first half and the Rangers' goalless streak did not seem to be in balance.
As Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston moved up to third place, and Hibernian came in second in scoring.
And there was no reason to worry about the Rangers following the fact that the Calum spence needed surgery for a head injury after being thrown from a side injury that appeared to have originated in the front.
Gerrard made eight changes to the final round of the Ayr Cup before the finals.
Holt, on the other hand, took the 11th Word that broke Hearts' score last week and enjoyed the thrill of his highly trained team pressing their enemies in every corner.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball while they were on the sidelines, but Livingston did more with the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes into the pitch and the first release of Menga sent Scott Pitman in with a goal from Allan McGregor but the midfielder missed his best opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' hardball had already been caught by captain Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Litgow managed to hit it from the backfield.
The Rangers managed to gain control but it seemed more hopeful that they believed in their third game in the series.
Alfredo Morelos felt convinced that he should have received a penalty at the end of the fourth quarter as he and Steven Lawless fought, but Steven Thomson shot the Colombian forward.
The Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly affected by the head kick of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Since the opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the game, no one can deny that it was worth the effort.
The Rangers failed again to meet Jacobs's goal
Scott Arfield did not retaliate when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the choice of Menga lightly and finished it lightly.
Gerrard got up during the break and switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and the change almost brought the result when the winger beat Morelos but Kelly, who was the creator of the screen, ran to his side and stopped.
But Livingston continued to swallow the guests and made them play their way, and Lithgow and Halkett threw a long string of balls.
Holt's side may have continued their lead towards the end of the game but McGregor stood firmly out of Jacobs before Lithgow kicked the lead off the offense.
Glenn Middleton of the Rangers who came in the middle used a penalty to hit Jacobs but Thomson looked away.
German: The designer of the Geiger Counter
Now a page from our Sunday Morning German: November 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECALL ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring high-speed radiation emissions, a development that eventually led to the Geiger Counter.
As the backbone of science since then, Geiger Counter has also been the backbone of popular culture, such as the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, which featured the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Brother: What is this?
Rogers: It is the Geiger Counter, which is used to detect the emission of uranium-rich minerals.
You can hear the sounds of the atoms that are being pulled from the minerals.
Evans: Well, it's already going strong!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the design that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the body's immune system to detect malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the body's immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
A vaccine teaches the body's immune system to store malignant cells as part of a treatment
The technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and then transforming them into a laboratory
They then detected the protein common in other cancer cells and injected it again
The vaccine is showing positive results for patients with certain types of cancer.
One woman who received the injection, who trained the body's immune system to store malignant cells, observed that her cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting cells from a patient, modifying them in a laboratory to detect the protein HER2 common in some cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says. Our results tell us that we have a promising vaccine.
HER2 is responsible for the growth of several types of cancer. Including breast, uterine, lung, and colon, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar technique of extracting cells from a patient and then learning how to recognize them has been used to treat a type of bone cancer.
Kanye West has joined Trump's smear campaign, wearing a MAGA Hat, following his appearance on SNL
It Was Not Pretty
Kanye West was silenced by a studio-wide scream during Saturday's Night Live after a lively performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump for his 2020 candidacy.
After releasing her third song that night, titled Ghost Town, wearing a sleeveless hat, Make America Great, she climbed down the Democratic ladder and emphasized her support for Trump.
I often talk to a white person and they say: How can you love Trump, racially biased?
"If I had been a racist, I would have been out of Merika", he says.
SNL introduced the show with the celebrity Matt Damon when the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blassey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the Western news was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was willing to disrespect West for what he posted on the Internet.
West also complained to the audience that he had been a bit of a hard person behind the stage with his hat.
They sat me behind the stage.
They say, get off the stage with your hat.
They've got me!
Then they called me a "scooter", he said, according to the Washington Inspector.
West continued: "You want to see how bad I am? You want to see how the world is moving forward?"
Continue to have love.
His comments drew at least two complaints from viewers that made the dust of the SNL show embarrassing, reports Variety, where one responded: The studio was all silent as if dead.
West had been brought in to fill the void for singer Ariana Grande, whose beloved rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West performed the song "I Love It" in a Perrier Bottle style.
West was supported by Candice Turner, head of the anti-revolutionary group TPUSA, who said: "One of the most courageous spirits: WE ARE GREAT TO BE STAND UP TO THE ATTENDERS.
But the founder of the chat show, Karen Hunter, assumed that West was "what I was", and that is commendable.
But I chose NOT to bribe anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their artwork) who I believe accepts and expresses a dangerous way of thinking in my community.
He is free.
We are too.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as Kanye West.
He is not the first musician to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His rapper partner, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and Prince, the older singer, changed his name to a brand and became the singer Prince had known before.
Trial of attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following the shooting of a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The cases will be handled by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington defeats a soldier
Kit Harington is known for his sword-twisting role as Jon Snow in the long-running HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor expressed his opinion of the heroic hero, saying that such images on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be too tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that something went wrong and asked how the problem of male toxicity could be solved in this #NamiFuts era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that she feels "very upset" about the experience.
"I feel very bad about myself, I feel very bad about myself - what has gone wrong with manhood?" he says.
What did we teach men of our youth about the problem we see today?
Kit believes that television may have played a role in the rise of male violence, and we mourn the actors who portray male violence.
He continued: "What is inside us and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should be in some aspect of being a man?
I think that is actually one of the most important questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because obviously something is wrong with our young ones.
In an interview, he also agreed that he would not play any of the previous or subsequent Game of Thrones series until the series ended next summer, stressing that we have finished with battlefields and horses.
From November Kit will be the lead in Sam Shepard's True West revival, a film about a filmmaker and his brother, a criminal.
The actor recently expressed his opinion that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so it gave me my family's future, and my life from now on", he says.
Rose played Ygritte, who was a favorite of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning thriller.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the grounds of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, an estimated 40,000 new cases were reported.
Many new phenomena have been sexually transmitted, which means that there is a change in the past.
Historically, HIV has spread rapidly in many parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, health officials in China said at a summit in Yunnan province.
Yet, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a hot topic among LGBT people in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is said to be on the rise.
Because of the changing health care systems, various studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the infectious diseases are caused by a lack of adequate sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised that HIV vaccines will be available to everyone as a way to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies being manipulated by GOP sensor data operators, denouncing dangerous lies and ideas for self-defense.
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff leaked information about three U.S. Republican senators and posted them on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has complained that the allegations are being removed by experts who rely heavily on the right and websites.
Lying, lying, and other green lies, Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information reportedly includes the address and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online on Wednesday by an anonymous person in Capital Hill as the Senate nomination panel was charged with misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The scandal came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the content was associated with Waters' office and information was also obtained about one of the employees at Waters' office, at the Biks Hill.
The unfounded accusations are false and false, Waters continues.
The employee in my office - his degree, his knowledge of the subject, and the security that has been compromised by the illegal and false accusations - is by no means the owner of this information.
These unfounded accusations are false and false.
Waters' speech quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including a departure from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
The denial of this is more of a rage,  writes Fleischer.
This means that he is not a gentle member of the Order.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
They should not be forced to do so.
They must not question the intent of the accuser.
They must be calm and calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the outrage of the Democratic-led Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by the prosecutors of being outraged during the hearing on Wednesday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who campaigned to remove Waters from the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's very true", he said with a smile.
In a statement, Waters told his office to warn the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials of the illegal allegations.
We will ensure that these crimes are exposed, continue,and that they will face lawsuits for these destructive and dangerous acts against any member of my staff.
Johnny English's Revisited and Revised - Rowan Atkinson's unproven cheating
It is now common to see a prominent feature in any new British film that appears to be useful in reviving the deceptive comedy franchise of Johnny English - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English returning in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this comparison to the fact that it is already so bad that it is a new opportunity to export?
However, the big-eyed, rough-faced, and ignorant Johnny English has his license renewed a second time - his name more than anything indicates that he is the target of a widespread ridicule for non-English-speaking theaters.
He is a private agent who claims that his uncomfortable style is a reflection of Clouseau's, Mr. Bean's, and the man's shyness that led to the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He also relies on a traveler and international spy named Atkinson, who once played a TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving a mess in his wake.
There is one or two minutes of joy in the JE's visit.
I loved the sight of Johnny English approaching the back of a fighter plane in a fighter suit and the flights were hitting his iron suit.
Atkinson's gift for humor is touted, but the comedy sounds weak and unnecessary, especially when the titles of comedy films like 007 and Mission Impossible still include humor as a catchphrase.
The joke sounds like it's for kids rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's bad show is not a good way to make sense of the same thing as being funny in the silent movie Atkinson as Bean.
The basis for the current situation is that Great Britain is in crisis.
The cyber hacker's brains have engaged British intelligence agencies, revealing the identity of all British agencies in this role, which is surprisingly the agent's existence - unfortunately, a minor role for Kelvin Eldon.
The end of a violent and arrogant prime minister, who is facing a political decline: Emma Thomson is doing her best and behaves almost as Teresa May did, but there is little in the scriptures that can be applied.
His wise advisers told him that since all the spies had been exposed, he would have to bring back a retired man.
And that is what Johny English, a self-made man who is now employed as a school principal at a leading company, says, but who teaches unwritten lessons on how to be a secret worker: it is more ridiculous in this regard, since English has an intelligence academy at the School of Rock-type.
English is sent back to Whiteball for a quick interview and to meet up with former teammate Bough, who has been a bit of a stalwart of Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, and is in the custody of a submarine commander, a recreational-toys-club where Vicki Pepperdine spends her time.
However, the Batman and Robin team at Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, meeting the female fatale of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling into the trap of the popular and wealthy tech man who claims he can solve Britain's computer wars: criminal Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embarked on their long, absurdly high-curve journey: dressed as a whore, lighting a fire in a French restaurant; a year-old barber and a volcano; and English removed the top of the headset as he tried to see the interior of the Volta house.
Everything is already open to the program, but despite the peace and unrest, there is little children's TV about all this.
Balance of measure.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a stage that uses his talent?
Labour denies that it has developed a plan for British people to work four days a week but be paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a major plan to see Britain work four days a week - but pay five days.
The party demands that the company's executives transfer the costs of artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them one more day of rest.
It will give them three days' weekends - but they will be paid the same amount.
The sources say the idea could be linked to the party's economic agenda and that it is planning to incite the country to consider workers.
The four-day shift has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to seize the opportunity for a changing economy.
A source from the former Labour Party told The Sunday Times: The review of the policy is expected to be announced within a year.
Not overnight but a four-day work week in the interest of the party's economic balance sheet by allowing employees and the party's sector-wide strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to adopt such a view, and the Green Party has committed to a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this desire is not fully supported by the Labour Party at this time.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day workweek is not the party's goal and not the party's ambition.
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party summit last week to discuss his views on socialist economic reforms.
Mr. McDonnell has said he is determined to force the reinstatement of the invisible directors and professors of service companies.
The council's plans also explain that current shareholders in water companies may not receive all of their profits as the Labour Party may be able to "break it down" using possible fraudulent motives.
He also reaffirmed the idea of putting employees on corporate boards and establishing public Inclusive Ownership Funds to give employees 10 percent of the profits of private companies, from which they could receive dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells 60 minutes that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh may change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by a week or so, and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could change the minds of some Republican senators to draw their vote.
During a talk show broadcast on Sunday, the 60 minutes representative Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might reveal something that would change their minds.
Kenndy seems to be more open to talking than her South Carolina partner.
"I understand, of course", Kennedy said.
I have attended the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, the accusations came out, and I said, Did you do this?
He was strong, determined, and unshakable.
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been suspended.
"I have already spoken my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and there are strong accusations", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but here's what I know: Brett has vehemently denied this, adding Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
Everyone who names him has not confirmed it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new that could change.
What is Global Citizen, and Has Poverty Been Reduced?
This Saturday New York will be hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event where the most spectacular creatures create spectacles and machines of this kind; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see hundreds of thousands of people gather in the Central Park Grand Valley not only to celebrate the achievements of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to celebrate the event's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, continues the Global Poverty Project, a group that represents countries in the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people facing it.
To get a free admission ticket (unless you want to pay a VIP), concertgoers had to complete a list of activities, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or any other means to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how far has Global Citizen gone in the 12 years since its goal was reached?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a valid incentive, or is it just another form of clicktivism - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online application or sending a tweet.
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million tento have been reported from its followers, conducting a series of evaluations of various goals.
These actions have helped to relieve world leaders of announcing obligations and policies with a budget of $37 billion set aside to affect the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group identified 390 bonds and securities claims, of which at least $10 billion had already been settled or cleared.
The group estimates that the money collected has directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
Among these outstanding commitments are a program headquartered in the U.K., called The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of funders and workers who are committed to helping children grow up fully, which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end undernourishment in the country, followed by more than 4,700 grants from Global Citizen.
With the help of the U.K. government, donors, governments around the world, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment a footnote in history", Tracey Ullman, spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to urge the U.K. to increase the nutrition of children and mothers, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach five million women and children through nutrition interventions.
To answer one of the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the website, why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
The Global Citizen said: It will be a long and difficult road - one that will fall and fail.
But, as the great struggle for human rights and anti-apartheid government before us, we will succeed, because we have the greatest power united.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers who will be present at this year's New York City event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to block Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could use, if necessary, the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke said that Russia's involvement in Syria - in a commentary, if it operates under the official government's invitation - is a sham to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason the Middle East is so far away is because they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, and in the heart of Southern Europe.
And according to the official, there are ways and procedures to deal with it.
"America has the ability, through our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, blocked, to ensure that their power is not out of the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to the audience at a ceremony hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and he saw that they were successful.
"Iran and Russia's credit industry could almost be flooded or replaced by oil", he said, calling Russia "the calf of the horse-drawn-throat" economy based on the bushes of trees.
The speech comes at a time when the Trump administration is increasingly pushing for exports and the export of its natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, Europe's largest consumer.
In terms of the change, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to exit the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is twice the size of the current 110 billion cubic meters, is a complete economic project.
The Kremlin is opposed to Washington's strong economic and competitive stance.
"I believe we share the same view that energy should not be a tool of oppression and that consumers should be able to choose their own providers", said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after his meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in November.
The U.S. action has caused Germany to point a gun at it, confirming its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has told America to stay neutral on EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem with a third country failing to deliver our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "Will Look Carefully" at the 2020 Presidential Campaign, said the Massachusetts Senate
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "look closely" at the presidential campaign after the midterm elections.
During a question-and-answer session in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren assured him that he would consider the campaign.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and put women in a position of power", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will be looking forward to running for president".
Warren inspired President Donald Trump during a question-and-answer session, saying that he "is taking the world in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has expressed his condemnation of Trump and his nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said "yes, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a ballot paper released on Wednesday showed that most of Warren's party did not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' candidates voted for the right to vote, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the campaign.
The poll showed strong support for the campaign of former Prime Minister Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the potential campaign and 48 percent opposing it.
Some of the top Democratic names mentioned in the 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
Biden has said he will make a formal decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD from Donald Trump's bed
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up for the New Year.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son experienced, what he experienced when he came back, I feel for other families who heard about the PTSD and the injuries of some of our soldiers who brought them", he told a laboratory at Donald Trump's village in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his capture "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other gamers, "they came back a little different, stronger, and more dignified, and more dignified, with the military and air force, and all the members of the military, who gave the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, including stealing a pork chop from a domestic violence report and drunken assault, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
In 18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of the new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have upheld a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum seekers fleeing domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and a district filed a court-appointed case Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker and challenged the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions' lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on August 16 against the organization's policies has not yet been released.
She said that her "partner and her sons, who were members of a violent gang", had abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was married in Texas.
A district attorney who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang violence and other domestic violence.
The United States' asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeals for Refugees that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a speech on Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine of Columbia said the new policy "looms the legality of the old state, national, and international law".
"The law of the association requires that all asylum claims be determined by the facts and circumstances of the case, and such a ban violates the principle", said the associate justice.
The legal team also argued in the legal document that the immigration ban was a serious blow to the U.S. economy, claiming that they had a high potential for business and "a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions told immigration judges to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic violence and genocide in the Philippines.
"The asylum of those who have fled their homes in their countries because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular political group", said Sessions in his policy statement on June 11.
Refugees were not designed to solve all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world.
The recovery of the bones in the city of Palu, where the death toll is doubled in the race for survivors
For those who survived, the situation was very bad.
"It sounds terrible", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fiery son in the last surviving center in the devastated city of Palú.
"Every time an ambulance brings corpses.
Clean water is a famine".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking their stuff from the water, trying to save what they could.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were evacuated, devastated by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palua Military Hospital, where patients were being treated for the tremors that followed.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke when he heard a violent earthquake in the fifth floor of the hotel room where he was sitting with his wife and child.
"We had no time to save ourselves.
I was crushed by the collapsed wall, I thought", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that your family was in town because you hadn't come to the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my little girl.
I hope they are safe".
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "scamming" with "scamming ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper issued a daily four-page ad that showed U.S. trade profits from China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using a U.S. newspaper to spread a propaganda propaganda message.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed a paid China Daily ad in Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling wine newspaper - after accusing China of trying to block the November 6 US congressional elections, prosecuting Chinese opposition.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to influence the US election were the reason US officials told Reuters that a new phase in Washington's campaign was to pressure China
Although it is common for governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a constant trade war that has forced them to pay each other taxes on their purchases.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit merchants and sell to other provinces such as the Lao, the main exporting province of China that supports the Trump Republican Party, say U.S. and Chinese experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former minister of agriculture, the largest exporter of Chinese agricultural products, told Beijing to supply American workers, farmers, and businesses.
In a commentary section in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, Branstad wrote in Chinese, "now the number of propaganda and propaganda ads for a provocative speech has doubled in our free press".
"By spreading its spirit of mob, China is introducing American culture to free speech and free news by posting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In comparison, in a newsstand in the streets of Beijing, you will find a few words with different opinions and you will not see the negative thoughts of the Chinese people about the economic downturn in China, when you look at the press being oppressed by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the largest Chinese newspapers is avoiding publishing" his article, but did not specify which one.
Republican leaves female voters with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning the protesters
While many Republicans stood up to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faced multiple sexual assault charges, the campaigners warned that they would see a negative response, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment about this is high, and many Republicans are already registered to vote.
These things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubts the last minute ruling of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on the FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Mothers will never forget what happened yesterday - not tomorrow and not even September", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MovOn, said on Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday afternoon, they protested with the "May is coming!" protest in the Senate lobby where the Republican-controlled Justice Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's trial by ignoring Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and determination of the Democrats will be lost". Stu Rothenberg, a politically conservative commentator, told a news agency.
"People say it's a big deal; that's the truth.
But it can be very dangerous, especially for women voters and young voters, 18-29 years old, who when they dislike the president, they don't vote".
Even in the face of the evidence of Ford's public defender who accused him of sexual harassment of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there might be a negative outcome if the Republicans were to be convinced.
"This is the GOP's slowdown", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote in the final ballot or whether Kavanaugh is on the ballot, but also about how the Republicans are handling it and how they're handling it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, the Democratic ballot group, told a news channel.
However, Melika seems to be divided over who to trust about the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter side slowly siding with her.
A recent poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe or are likely to believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
Additionally, 38 percent of respondents thought that Kavanaugh might have lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the investigation, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford and at least one defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had been injured by drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that a Supreme Court nominee showed him his private parts at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980's.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet that will compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, has launched a campaign to revive Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest prize for this technological giant, the Contribution, is a company that created the open platform of the firm of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their personal information is stored and which students are allowed access to what information.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Internet behind Inrupt "is dominating the world".
"We must do it now", he said of the birds.
"A historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online data store or POD".
We may have lists of contacts, schedules, calendars, music libraries, and other professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all have the same browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of this online information store is that everything is available to the owner and can access any information he wants at any time.
The company calls it "a skillful training of information".
Inrupt's vision, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security position provided by IBM, employees hired to work on the project, and a community of code-writing volunteers.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can build their own apps in different locations using the Inrupt web interface.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they are introducing a complete change in where all their business models are completely discontinued overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a paper published in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's machines "provide market power and collaboration to help protect the reputation and integrity of the new Web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the International Web Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
During these months, Berners-Lee has a voice that influences the central network of databases.
Even when Inrupt is introduced, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the International Web Society, the Web Fund, and the Open Data Center.
"I have a strong hope for the future of the web", adds Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross leader is denied
It was the only Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as much as it had in the war that had taken place in England 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 June 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a soldier who had hidden himself in a four-stage van and did not know that he had won Britain's highest military honor.
His memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the stone would be "the most beautiful symbol" to be displayed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to The Llandani Gazette, on 29 June 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led an army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a foggy landscape and under fire from cannons and rifles".
He then hurried to the line of fire and, "with great determination and confidence", led the army forward before he hurried the gunman with one hand and shot three teams of heavy-handed men.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, now 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a little unrealistic, but humiliating".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid flowers at the back of the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored to be part of the parade" and added that "being brave before a real hero's death is a show of support from the masses".
MMA fighters sat up all night watching Bellator 206, instead of Peppa Pig
Imagine sitting down all night watching the complete Bellator 206 and finding out that you are not allowed to watch a big party.
The bill from San Jose had 13 bills, including six on a large card and was shown live at night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were shocked when the new show Peppa Pig was shown.
Some were unhappy after staying awake until the early hours of the morning, waiting for the news.
One of the Twitter audience described the adaptation of children's cartoons as "a disgusting joke".
"It is government policy that at 6 a.m. that was not the right thing to do and they need to turn off the children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's chief marketing and communications officer, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa is a pig", yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they would change their schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about playing again, I think that maybe that will work", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can't work until Sunday, Monday.
But if we get drunk, we will fix it.
I believe that during the Reformation, there were many unfavorable texts.
We tried to fix it, thinking it was just a technical trap.
But it was not a matter of public policy.
I promise you that in the future, it will not happen.
We will keep five battles instead of six - as we usually do - and try to overstate our beliefs and become too arrogant.
It is a sad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt nothing about sex addiction
Olympic star Tom Daley says that growing up, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he had never realized until he was in high school that "not everyone is like him".
Speaking on the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, directed by Lauren Laverne, he advocated gay rights to give others "hope".
He also says that his parenting made him lose focus on winning the Olympics.
The popular hostess of the show, Kirsty Young, is taking weeks off because of illness.
Appearing as a girl in Laverne's first program, Daley said that as she grew up, she felt "little" to everyone because "it was socially unacceptable to have sex with boys and girls".
"To this day", she says, "those feelings of inferiority and of being different have been lessons learned that have given me the strength and the motivation to succeed".
He wanted to show that he was "nothing", he said, so that he would not embarrass the person when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a leading LGBT activist and used her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on many countries to stop criminalizing homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt fortunate to be free to go beyond the abuse and to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that dating the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "was a surprise to me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, last year but says the annual age trophy is not a problem.
"When you were so young", he said - when he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find a person of his age who had the same problems.
The couple became parents in June of their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked last year, it was all about 'I want to win gold medals,'" he said.
"You know, there are things that are greater than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer.
Daley says that his father refused to accept his death and that one of the things he asked for was a ticket to the 2012 race - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I can't tell him you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad", she said.
"I held his hand when he breathed his last and it was then that he stopped breathing and was dead when I realized that he was too strong to fail", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I realized that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to be ahead of my home crowd at the Olympic Games - was the best feeling I could ever have", she said.
It also sparked a stir in his first song - The Pride of Heather Small - which was a heartfelt reaction to the Olympic preparations.

Mickelson out of the road for the Ryder Cup Saturday
Phil Mickelson of the United States set a record on Sunday when he played his 47th Ryder Cup, but he would have to change his approach to avoid becoming a disgraceful player.
Mickelson, who played in the record-breaking 12th edition of the tournament, was placed on the bench by Jim Furyk and scored four goals and four more on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of a movement, as he often did in the United States, the five-time winner divides his day between being a successful leader and playing his game in the field in the hope of finding out what is causing his illness.
No other top-level golfer, the 48-year-old, is worthy of Le Golf National, where the longtime golfer has failed.
And if the task itself is not enough, Mickelson, at the nineteenth game on Sunday, will also watch the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four points, start the game with a warm-up, then Mickelson's game could be a big hit.
Furyk expressed confidence in the man, not that he had too much to say.
"He was totally out of his game today, he threw me in the back and he hugged me saying he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk says.
"You're so confident in yourself.
You are a Successful and have made a great contribution to these groups in the past, and this week.
I never thought he could play two games.
I had a lot of thoughts, but that's the way it was and that's the way we thought we were going.
You want to be here, like everyone else".
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record in the most Ryder Cup wins on Sunday.
It may be the end of a career that has never been in line with his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time losses, although Furyk claims his presence has brought the team a lot of prominence.
"She's funny, she's funny, she's smart, she's funny, and she's a good person to be with in a group room", he explained.
"I hope the young players enjoyed playing with you this week, which was a pleasure to see.
You give more than just a gamble".
European economist Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead may be a dead end
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from my experience that a lead near the final host in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a draw.
The Dane set his record in the 1997 Valderrama, where the youngest player in the Ballesteros National Team scored five points in a game against the Americans but only hit a winning margin, scoring 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It's just been reminding them that we were ahead at the Valderrama; we were ahead at the Brooklyn, where we were eaten, and at the Valderrama, where we won, but only", says Bjorn, who was photographed, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and the store lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the others in the history that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will be fully fit.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not all until you have your points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is trying to win the cup, and that is where we are focused.
I've always been focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know what awaits the other side - the world's greatest players".
"I can't put myself first", Bjorn said, impressed by the way his players played the hard-fought game.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
Tomorrow is a one-off game, and that is a different thing.
It is a privilege to be there with a mate when things are going well, but when you are alone, your skills as a golfer are thoroughly tested.
That is the message you should give to the players, that you should give your best tomorrow.
now, she leaves her partner behind and must go to find the best thing for herself, too".
Similarly, for Bjorn, the number that Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than their teammates, especially Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of that great final day, part of the successful Brooklyn team before he was finally defeated when Europe unleashed "Magic in Medina".
"I remember all the words you said", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, encouraged his players on the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you'd like to start right away with the first thing you've seen in Brooklyn, the second thing you've seen in Medina.
when one side of the game is at a higher level, the other side is at a higher level.
We are doing our best to get our boys to be well-dressed, and we are going to try to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas was assigned to try out for Rory McIlroy in the big game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top tier of the standings.
"I took the boys out this way because I thought they should be able to finish", said Bjorn, his favorite type of ring.
A new German warship is once again delayed
The new German Navy ships with various weapons were to be delivered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War ships, but they will not be available until next year due to inefficient systems and high costs, local media reported.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the new flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg armed forces, has now been postponed until the middle of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military figure.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the recent introduction caused problems for the enthusiasm of the designers.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, which were acquired by the German Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen.
Understand that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-ship missiles and ground-based technologies, such as radar, red-light indicators, and sound signals.
Other important features include long maintenance times - the ability to remove the newly assembled weapons for two years without being on the home shore.
However, the continuing delay means that the first warships - that allowed Germany to exert its power overseas - will be out of date once they are operational, Die Zeit said.
The F125 warship with its own weapons set a record last year when the German Navy formally refused to withdraw the ship and returned it to the Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builders after it had been delivered.
The cause is unknown, but German news reports point to a number of "inland and outdoor" misconceptions that rendered the warship useless if it was not taken out for combat.
The software was essential because the Baden-Wuerttemberg would be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors - half the crew of the older Bremen.
Moreover, the ship was found to be much heavier than expected, so the naval force was not able to replace it with more advanced equipment.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz", which weighed some 7,000 tons, is believed to have been twice as heavy as the similar ship used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the poor exterior, the overall cost of the project - including military training - is also a problem.
It is estimated to have reached €3.1 billion to $3.6 billion - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new ships became more serious, especially as warnings were issued that the German navy was losing strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Sea Wars were in fact "lacking the proper ships to be built for certain areas".
The official said the problem was that the older ships were not taken out and replaced.
He complained that none of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg ships had been able to join the Battle of the Sea.
The Trust of the Velobe reveals the secrets of the life of the ants
A new study on a estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how ants use the land to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this discovery will provide new insights into the behaviour of these mammals and help pave the way for future conservation efforts.
The research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the oldest land snails and long-eared brown snails and the Daubenton snails at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special aircraft will be installed at key locations to monitor the activity of mosquitoes at all times.
NHS staff and volunteers can also make a donation using handheld drugs.
Experts who analyze the sounds of the crawling insect will find out how often the crawling insect communicates with each other and what species does.
a map of the area and a report will be produced to make a local assessment of the behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, said the results would reveal which habitat is most important for these reptiles and how each species uses it.
This information will help to benefit from the work of conservation efforts, such as building a nesting site for mosquitoes and other wildlife.
The numbers of cockroaches in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are alarmed by the construction and development projects that affect their meeting places and their living quarters.
Air conditioning and lighting can also be dangerous, such as insect pests and chemical contaminants, and domestic cats can attack.
In fact, the moths are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more active than their eyes and they are more effective at catching prey.
They use a unique sound technique to point at insects and traps in the airway.
NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is a major attraction for bats.
It has ten trained craftsmen, who often dig, inspect, and sometimes rescue.
Scotland has even established a breeding zoo in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten primates.
The land manager, David Thompson, says that the estate is their best.
"Here in Threave we have a very good place for the boys", he said.
"We have old buildings, logging plants, and all the good places.
But there is much more about the insect that is unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what it needs to grow".
The importance of testing the locust is emphasized before the site is ready, since it is possible that the unprotected breeding ground could kill up to 400 female and their young, destroying almost all of the locust.
They are protected and are not allowed to kill them, harass them, or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Parrot Conservation Trust, urged the community to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our cats and how they work", he said.
Ronaldo quits rape charges as lawyers say they will sue a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo says that the allegations of rape are "false stories", and that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus are accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room number 2009 in Las Vegas.
He was ordered to pay $375,000 for not speaking up, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking live on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today is false news", said the five-time winner of the competition.
"They want to be proud of me.
It is common.
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's representatives insisted on the allegations being made to Der Spiegel, which they called "a confidential report that cannot be used as evidence in court", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the player would seek compensation "for the damage to his reputation that is equal to the amount of damage, one of the greatest violations of the right to privacy in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they raped him and stabbed him in the back, according to documents filed in Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga said that Ronaldo knelt down after the incident and told him that he was "99 percent" more "good" than "one percent".
The documents said Ronaldo had convinced the two men that they had had sex, but that was a compromise.
Mayorga says that he went to the police again and was taken away from the hospital with pictures of his farm, but later admitted that the matter was settled out of court because he "feared to take revenge" and was concerned about "public outrage".
The 34-year-old says that if he wanted to change the solution now, he would have continued to be frustrated about the incident.
Ronaldo had just joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged injuries, and this summer he joined Italian giants Juventus for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will "always regret" not losing its position as a leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He went on to say that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told BBC Britain had left the EU without a party and would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a party", Mr. Clark said.
Japanese carmakers say that a car accident in the event of a brexit could result in job losses.
The firm of Burnaston - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were shipped to the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of May, we will see a production in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Some UK carmakers expressed their fears about leaving the EU outside the deal on how the international trade would work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Oxford-based manufacturing plant one month after Brexit.
The biggest concern about what carmakers say is the risk of buying without a Brexit deal.
Toyota's production continues "on time", and drivers arrive every 37 feet from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars to be ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29th January, there could be a border disruption that the industry says could lead to migration and shortage of employers.
It is not possible for Toyota to hold a list of key products for more than one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and production will not be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's future policy of separation from the EU "is designed to avoid border checks".
"We need a deal. We want a deal that is the best that will allow you to not only enjoy the success you have now but also us to seize the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers that we need to be able to continue the most successful product that the purchase process has designed".
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but in the long run, it warned that the additional costs would reduce competition and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the University of Burnaston for 24 years and is the Associated Press's chief producer, said of his members who were concerned: "As far as I know, these jobs may go back and forth.
A government spokesman said: "We have set out a very exciting and exciting plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting is likely and likely to be held, the White House said
Donald Trump's emergency meeting with attorney general Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed another week" as the Supreme Court continues to fight for nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has been faced with the task of special counsel Robert Mueller, investigating a pig's foot in the Russian election, the links between Trump and Russia and the possible impasse of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the attorney general or not, and thereby endangers Mueller's independence, we are spreading the rumor of Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the use of grain to record a trumpet and the possibility of removing the president on the 25th anniversary.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday at the White House, despite reports, he had even threatened to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was in New York's United Nations, ended on Wednesday.
Trump said it was "better" not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a dispute with the Senate Judiciary Committee over the news that Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both had testified.
On Friday, Trump issued an order for a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, which is holding a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "Before the date is set, I see that the other proceedings in the high court are postponed by one week.
But then we will see and we will like to keep the news".
Other reporters will argue: Sanders will hold a press conference at the White House beginning on November 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of meetings was because the TV presenters "did not like to be proud", while he said: "I do not agree with their arrogance".
He then suggested that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any previous president", he said, adding, in addition to testifying: "We have looked at those numbers".
Publications are still to be made, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions - directly, that's much better than talking.
We have tried to do this more and more and you have seen us do it more and more in the past few weeks, and we will continue to do so in the press when you speak to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting officials.
One news conference is a famine.
In New York this week, the president may have explained why, and then left the news unexpectedly.
Health secretary writes EU staff to NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay in the old Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter six months before the UK left the EU.
Hulmende, from Scotland, had already committed to cover the costs of applying for EU citizenship who work in the government services that were dissolved.
Finally, Mr. Freeman wrote: "This summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving are ongoing, leading to a decision expected this autumn.
But Britain is also better prepared to deal with the possibility of a nuclear deal.
I will say that this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize now how much I appreciate the contribution of all the workers, regardless of their nationality.
They are the partners in the work from the EU and beyond, bringing with them experience and skills that are essential to strengthen and improve healthcare, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we have a lot to offer you".
Christion Abercrombie Urgently Operated After A Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly - within half an hour.
"She just fell down there", Reed said.
The instructors and health workers gave Aercrombie a clean air at the side of the vehicle before he was placed in a frame and transported for testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just completed the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no information on the type/scale of the injury" is available at this time and that the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a junior, is in his first season in Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had a total of five hits on Saturday before the game, adding to his season-ending 18 hits.
foreign buyers will be taxed on stamps when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax if they buy houses in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme
This will help to reduce the intensity of the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The stamp tax increase will be levied on non-taxable persons in the UK
Property is expected to grow to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay a large stamp tax on their UK home purchases - and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move would be seen as an attempt to reduce the levy and exacerbate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters by promising to give more affordable housing and target the highest-paid.
The stamps will be taxed by individuals and businesses in the UK who are not paying, and the additional tax will stimulate the Government's campaign against sleep deprivation.
The additional tax - added to the existing stamps, including the higher rates imposed two years ago on second homes and rent - can be as high as three percent.
The estate expects to generate £120 million a year.
With only 13 percent of new homes in London being bought by UK residents, the price increases and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to buy new homes.
Many parts of the rich world - especially the big cities - are "no longer inhabited" by the large number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson announced a stamp duty bill to help young people have homes.
He accused the big construction companies of raising house prices by taking land but not using it, and he asked Mrs. May to waive quotas on homes to fix the British housing shortage.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of positive initiatives to improve housing, including a tax cuts and an end to evictions "without a fault".
He also wants to give councils more power to build homes.
"Last year", said Mrs. May, "I promised myself that I would use my prime ministership to restore the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken home.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not appropriate for some non-British residents, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as hardworking residents.
For many, the dream of having a home is a long-term dream, and the frustration of not getting enough sleep is a reality".
Jack Ross: My last strength to rule Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross calls for "the last of the forces" to be Scotland's chief of staff.
Scot, 42, is looking forward to the challenge of rebuilding the North-East club, which currently sits third in League One, three points above.
He attended the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to make my country a better place as a player.
I got a B and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always been a thing of the past.
That opportunity will come to an end if I succeed in running the club".
The leaders of the Sunderland administration included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic was not afraid to follow the big names in the big club, having refused big-time offers from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"My success will be measured by 'can I get the club back to the Premier League?'
"Given the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I will see that I succeed here if I can bring the club back".
Ross has been in the position for three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months of training at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa rise from third position, and he turned St Mirren into the lowest-ranked champion the following season.
And Ross says that he feels more at ease now than ever before in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real cross", he recalled, loving Alloa's lead strings.
"I really believed that being a manager was more important than being a player.
It sounds like a wonderful thing because I have done well, enjoyed a good health, and enjoyed high-quality things.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things you need to go through with your voice.
I still struggle with the stresses and pressures of work, but driving sounds like a good thing.
I always wanted to be in charge, and now I am, it seems like the ease I have had all my life".

The best time to pioneer is Saturday evening at 5.30 p.m., the publisher has found
The heat wave of summer has increased the drinking in Britain's bar stops and the restaurant industry has become increasingly stressed.
The stamp and stamp companies saw a 2.7 percent increase in shopping in July - but in restaurants a 4.8 percent drop, figures uncovered.
Peter Martin, of the engineering business of the CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunlight in the English assembly for longer than expected at the World Cup means that the Colombo has followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month of June, when the bubbles were 2.8 percent higher, except that the restaurants were hit more than the previous one.
The 1.8 cents drop in the retail of restaurants on June was the worst on July.
The drinking fountains and the writing desk are much more efficient than the restaurants.
The food pipes are also sun-drenched, although they are not as sunny as the restaurants.
It seemed as if people were going out for a drink.
Of all the controlled vapes and mail order orders, the purchase rate increased by 6.6 percent that month, while the food supply decreased by three percent".
Paul Newman, of the RSM's recreation and entertainment research department, said: "The results continue to be the same as the results we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the wealth of social media continues to be a major factor in the increase in shopping outside the home.
It is surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, and even if the rate of shopping increases by 4.8 percent a year, it will be a tragic thing to continue to be under pressure.
This long, hot summer has come at a bad time for food workers and the timing will tell us about the average weather conditions we experienced in August that will provide the much needed time".
The sales rate for all pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in the production of species.

One in five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "fake Insta" pages
the media have raised concerns about the publication of pornography
Twenty percent of schoolchildren say they have "the right account" that they show their parents
One of the five children - some as young as 11 - kept hidden accounts on social media accounts from their parents.
A survey of some 20,000 high school students showed the increasing popularity of "fake Instagram" accounts - Instagram photo-sharing sites.
These stories have increased the fear of pornography being published.
Twenty percent of schoolchildren also said they have a "right" account to show their parents, fathers, and have private accounts.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a young man who told others that she had "rape me".
A survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that young people with the Internet are creating online accounts where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual governing body meeting.
Doyle, a Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie, described this as a great opportunity for sports directors to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and international athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly by putting him on the board", said Beattie.
"I am eager to be the voice of the athlete", Doyle said, "and I hope to be able to contribute and help direct the show in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400-meter medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta amid his Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC champion, was left unable to walk for a while after suffering from ischemic stroke.
"Today is the month since I lost my virginity", she wrote on Twitter.
They could not walk.
Doctors said that the time will tell if I will recover or how much.
It was a difficult task, but I recovered completely, started to learn to walk, and today I am doing some walking trips!
Thank you for the encouraging words!"
An advertisement for a grain pump that compares women to cows differs from one another on the Internet
The Internet has divided the opinion of a breastfeeding company because of an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to cattle being bought.
Introducing what is called "a world-class, quiet, wearable pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video ad that will show the new pump that gives nursing mothers the freedom to breastfeed.
Four real women danced in a cattle barn and sang a song that included words like: "Yes, I do, but you don't see the tail" and "Perhaps you haven't noticed that this is not my breasts, it's my breasts".
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the children, pump it out, pump it out, I kiss my wives".
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of suggestions, the video has received mixed responses from viewers, many of whom say it undermines the "great tribulation" of the dairy industry.
"The wrong decision to use cattle to promote the product.
Just as we need to fertilize and fertilize to produce milk, so too do our calves, unless they are fertilized within days of giving birth", wrote one.

Another observed: "It is a crisis for both mother and child.
But why would it be used to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are raising their children?"
Another added: "A commercial without emotion".
Some have blocked the ad, where one mother admits that she found the song "very funny".
"I think that's a very good idea.
I could have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a real cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm taking it for what it is.
"This is a wonderful product", wrote another.
Another commented: "This is a ridiculous advertisement for women who are flirting (usually with their jobs or toys) and feel "cows".
this is not a commercial that sets or condemns the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women show that all of them were dancing with their secret pumps on their boards.
The idea behind the campaign is that many breastfeeding mothers feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely quiet, has no pipes or tubes and fits neatly inside the breastfeeding board, giving mothers the freedom to move, carry their children, travel and even get out of the way of the breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner with Mother ECD, commented: "The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product that needed to be introduced with great care.
By balancing the milk-pumping of the women and the milk-pumping of the cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges and challenges of pumping, and we were showing the joyful and harmonious joy that the pump would bring.
This is not the first time that Elvi's pump has made headlines in the press.
During the fashion week of the Netherlands, a mother of two showed off her disdain for the design of Marta Jakubowski by using the product.
Hundreds of Foreign Children Peacefully Move to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of foreign-born marriages has increased dramatically and cross-border social networks continue to remain stable, in part because similar policies and the difficult policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in foster care.
In general, many immigrant helpers are not registered themselves, and they fear that they will lose their ability to remain in their country by taking the children out of the country.
The danger grew in June, when officials announced that prospective assistants and their family members should bring in fingerprints and that such information would be shared with foreign officials.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with his fellow Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested many of the people who had applied to help homeless children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the aid workers or family members of the aid workers in the country are illegal, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to follow those people", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to expedite the procedure, officials introduced a new policy requiring that some of the children be released within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days after the previous one, according to the shelter's owners.
Their network will be available through a video conference, rather than by themselves, to request legal status in the entrance hall.
those who are found unfit to be examined will be returned to their homelands soon.
The longer the children stay in the cell, the more they will have the opportunity to stay awake or to lose their temper, which will not lead to violence or attempted escape, according to shelter officials and recent reports.
Advocates say that this concern is especially high in large institutions such as Tornillo, where the signs of childhood obesity are more likely to be ignored because of their size.
They may not feel that taking children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends would add to the mental discomfort that many already have.
Syria urges the U.S., French, and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately from the enclave
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in Syria is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the 100th president, is the official representative of the Syrian state of war, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be treated fairly".
"They should leave immediately and without delay", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against the epidemic is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would "continue to wage this holy war until we have eliminated all Syrian terrorists "both terrorist groups and "any foreign presence".
Melika has 2,000 Syrian soldiers, mostly trained and trained in the Kurdish and Arab-Syriaan wars against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 World War II soldiers in this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and he accused "some western countries" of "increasing unjustified fear" that had prevented them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to take this case forward", he said.
"They have made the issue of public interest a political issue".
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was political consensus under Assad and until the war was over.
The UN representatives said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a central area for the Idlib terrorist base has opened the way for political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish pact prevented the Russian expansion of the Syrian army from taking over the region, which has a population of three million.
Moualem, however, insisted that the agreement "had clear provisions" and expressed hope that the military action would include jihadists, including militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "who would be destroyed".
The UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of the new committee, which includes the government and members of the opposition, to draft a post-war policy on Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem raised the possibility of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the current constitutional articles", and warned of the pig's footprint.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
According to the official plan, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 campaign without, as many liberals hope, being accused of dishonesty and disgrace ending his presidency prematurely.
Without a doubt "The most dramatic end of a president!"
At present, there are no internal signs of spectators.
Since 2014, the average time with the most viewers has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 billion prime-time viewers, 1.7 million a day four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow show" has surpassed the cable average of 3.5 million viewers a night for the mainstream news.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Survivor's Guide", about cabinet secretaries who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a playwright and author of "Just the Funny Parts: With a Few Hard Facts About Hate in a Hollywood Boys Club"," has a psychological background.
He recalls taking a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because you make fun of me", Mr. Scovell told me.
There is joy in a gathering.
Yes, unlike in other television programs, future Washington newscasters determined the future of the case of Roy v. Wade, that immigrant families could be integrated into the global economy.
Outdoor activities are entertainment that is not available to the general public.
And, beyond being a valued citizen, you find yourself on the sixth floor watching a panel of experts discuss the use of "deep color" by Bob Woodward seeking help with his book "Fear", bombing Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jeans jacket ("the dress of great pride", The Washington Post said) and what it means in Stormy Daniels' unfavorable interpretation of Mr. Trump's body.
I, alone, will never watch Super Mario the way I did.
"Part of what makes it sound like a real show is that someone is giving you all the busku", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's daily show of cycling and racing (against the N.F.L., picking up Kim Jong-un).
You cannot be sure that you will miss one episode and be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a hot 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
Brett Kavanaugh was expected to face the Supreme Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the air.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right".

Out of the money is the difficult choice of term in the Housing Competition
No wonder Pennsylvania 17 is experiencing a cash flood, all because of the restructuring of the congressional districts that have two contenders competing for the same seat.
Pittsburgh County and Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb of the pits recently redrawn - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running for another Republican, Keith Rothfus, who is now representing Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is far from the new 17.
The maps were updated after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled unanimously that the old districts were being converted into Republican lands.
The contest in the 17th district has affected the campaign finances of the ruling party's financial arm, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after nearly losing the general election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in January.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The politicians have given the Democrats a minor challenge.
Melika Weighed Penalties on El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off
The embassy realized that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with a slight surge of Washington.
Mr. Trump had a great meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired Trump's Inhalnagno control group.
Officials decided to call U.S. missionaries from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama back about "the recent decision to ban Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were directed to El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cutting the financial aid and visa restrictions, would be a tragedy for the U.S. Department of State and would result in unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North America and Central America organized high-level conferences focused on security and economic development following the similarities of last year's events that appeared to be a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in the midst of the storm, the top officials made it clear that they wanted the strike to continue, successfully ending all the fears of taxation in El Salvador.
Former president Mike Pence is now pressured to speak at the conference, now scheduled to be held in the heart of the capital, on the signing of the acquisition of foreign control of the convention, the delegates said.
And the three U.S. missionaries returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new strong message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that three hundred U.S. officials, including two U.S. ambassadors, had discussed.
These accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst who is closely connected to the authorities and who also mentioned the non-disclosure situation.
Learn from history
Another inevitable outcome would be a special council meeting on Robert Mueller's proposal to block Mr. Trump's justice, now heavily documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly referring his own investigation to the possibility that Mr. Trump's campaign was deliberately colluding with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress does not change its hands, Mr. Trump may find himself facing an accountability to the body, where he prepares to go to trial again, and finally to assist his fellow judges.
That is what most people think will happen if, and I am not sure that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - and that of his European counterparts.
There is a choice that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the span.
By 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler's regime, but the West spread the lie and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
It has failed, and it has missed the opportunity to avoid the age of death.
The study of history is based on these points of failure, and the demand for a difficult democracy is to prevent the cultivation of vineyards or to keep them.
Melika is facing these and many other points of such a tragedy now.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw the outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a state of shock since a newspaper reported that, last year, he had secretly recorded a vision of the president about his unwillingness to run for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the report in The Times is inaccurate.
"What will we do if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or not accurate - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and untruthful evidence?
And most importantly, will we vote in the space term to elect Congress to make Mr. Trump accountable or accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be in trouble for a long time.
But I am convinced that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had once ruined our family.
He lived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, he took me to light candles on the Sabbath on that table with the symbol of the swastika.
So, as a cripple, how can I remain unsure of our future?"

The hopeful leader of the Rangers' Graham Dorrans of Rapid Vienna is fighting
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Wednesday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after a good match between Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
The injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season from a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers could use those results as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game hoping to score and we scored.
I may have taken part in the final, but in all cases, the goal-scoring was a good result.
Perhaps they were better off in the first round and we moved from the second round to the better side.
On Wednesday, it is one of the largest nights in Europe.
I hope we can score three points but that will be a challenge because they have a good result in their last game but, with the crowds behind us, I am sure we can strive and get good results.
The past year has been a difficult one, despite all the injuries and changes at the club, but there is something that makes you feel good about yourself here now.
We know it well, and the boys really enjoy the training.
I hope we can get up and move on now, put our past past behind us, and win".
Mothers can no longer sleep because of the fear of the caterpillar
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they needed to be cared for, few spoke directly to their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of mothers talk to their children about it.
"People need a family member to take care of them, but they take steps to have that conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance business at Nationwide.
here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can arrange for your family to take care of you if you do not want your wishes to be known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss how and where you will be cared for, for such decisions can be crucial in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor may even help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Your decisions about long-term care can include a long-term care insurance policy, a high-quality insurance policy, or a personal savings account - as long as you have the funds.
Get your legal documents: Head of criminal cases at death.
Get a health care professional ready to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals act according to your wishes if you are unable to speak.
Also, consider who will be in charge of your finances.
You will appoint a trusted person to make decisions about your finances and to ensure that your debts are paid if you cannot afford them.
Keep this in mind: Suppose your elderly parent is in an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down all the details in your schedule so that you can plan ahead.
"It's not just the lawyers who matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
That plan is in place".
Man shot in the blast at Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times on his way home from a night out.
The victim, who was in his early 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials describe the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local time, as "an unplanned act".
The victim cannot see the target.
His injuries were not fatal, and the police asked eyewitnesses to come.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With the decline of communication, emergency services could not get information from the Donggala agent, a green-colored city in central Palu and the city center where the 7.5 magnitude earthquake damaged the city.
In Pallu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated during the disaster.
Here are some highlights about Palu and Donggala, in the Sulawesi stronghold:
Palau is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a small peninsula on the western coast of Chiwei Sulawes, and has an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
The Dongga is a 300-kilometer (180-mile) stretch of sandy beach on the western side of Sulawesi.
The region, a sub-district of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel ore is also an important mineral in the region, but it is mainly found in Morowali, on the coast facing Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami struck western Donggala again in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region that is prone to frequent earthquakes.
Here are some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26 caused a tsunami to strike 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late January.
Hundreds fled to Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck west Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami to strike a shallow coastline, killing 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai reservoirs in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters [10 feet] in depth that destroyed many communities and killed an estimated 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remember the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed hundreds of people.
No tsunami was recorded, but more than 100 people died in the collapse.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian resort of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the resort.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is in prison for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with wounding.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, is being held on charges of domestic violence, including involvement in domestic violence and refusal to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, one day when a woman wanted to report the crime to the police, she took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Pretrial and is being held without bail for $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, genuine" when he asked to be excused, the network reported.
Palin has three Class A counts, which could result in up to three years in prison or a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the allegations.
The case is currently pending in the Tigagay Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with the crime of kayaking, stealing a pig's foot in a domestic violence report, and treating a victim while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said she hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was ridiculed by a gay gang in 2016 after linking her sexual behavior to PTSD caused by her service in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds
At least 384 people died after the earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and power networks are in decline, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the north-eastern city of Jakarta, Indonesia.
There are videos on social media that show this treasure.
Hundreds of people were gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the coastal city of Palau when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek an unusual death sentence for a NYC gunman
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, accused of the New York City bombing that killed eight people - the rarest federal sentence since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot to carry out an assault on a motorcycle road on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bicyclists on the Mphela.
To justify his death sentence, prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov killed the eight victims "deliberately" and injured them "deliberately", according to the plea agreement filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both are on death row, according to court records.
Weeks after the attack, the assistant federal attorney general charged Saipov with 22 criminal charges, including eight counts of attempted murder, often committed by federal prosecutors in a systematic trial, and one count of assault and vehicular manslaughter.
The attack required "extensive planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's handling of the "grave, brutal and immoral crime".
"The Habibullaevic Saipov disaster caused the injury, accident, and loss of the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the intent statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine immigrants.
For the last time in ten years, the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a murder case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was sentenced to life in prison in November 2009.
The last federal death sentence in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by being put in a wheelchair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek funeral worker, expressed no regret for his actions in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the police that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov says he got his motivation to kill after watching an ISIS video on his cell phone, according to the opening documents.
He also asked to be advertised with an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He denied all 22 of his charges in the court papers.
David Patton, one of Saipov's most prominent federal defenders, said that they were "depressed" by the decision to prosecute.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than accept the sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole will cause a mental breakdown for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had initially asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "make a war of the people" today during the Tory convention.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should "hear the heat" from the Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs has suggested she should oversee the EU's petitions and consultations.
Conservative activist Peter Bone told the Birmingham crowd that the UK could 'go out' now with Mr Farage and Secretary-General for Brexit.
But the challenge Ms. May faced in uniting her divided church was fueled by pro-Remain Tories who joined a separate protest against the Brexit referendum.
The prime minister has a serious problem keeping his cornerstone Chequers program up to date in the wake of the Brexit attacks, Remembrance in the EU.
The Allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the bad wording - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and "disorder".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave village in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of Chequers'.
He proposed that Mr. Farage be made a partner and was given the task of consulting and soliciting in Brussels.
'If it had been for him,' he said, 'we would have left now.'
The Welingborough MP added: 'I will stand for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers.'
Planning to oppose the EU, he said: 'We have not fought world wars for control.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone rejected the view that the national landscape had changed since the 2016 elections: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not true.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, you listen to the people.
The unpopular 'Chequers', the Opposition, and the opposition are not popular, and it is unusual for our group and our hardworking party to see them go to the streets and be re-elected.
Please stop the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs and keep their promises".
Mr. Farage told local politicians that they should be "hot-tempered" if they are about to betray a resolution passed by the 2016 referendum.
'Now this is about the relationship between us - the people - and our political system,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and today they are here to tell them that 'we will not' let you succeed in doing that.'
He added to the message to the crowd: 'I want you to make our political sector, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel warm.
'We are joining the people's struggle that gave us victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we are independent, moral, proud of the United Kingdom.'
At that time, the Remainers had to cross Birmingham before they could catch a two-hour train ride through the centre of the city.
A few activists rallied the Tories in the Brexit ban after the party was introduced this weekend.
The Conservative counterpart Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with the party's app when the conference opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can make this IT initiative stand out with all the technology in Canada and, about the borderless, about the borderless free trade in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a perfect game.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is considering "glassing" the presidential campaign
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "put a glass on the issue of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future on Saturday at a convention hall in a city in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is campaigning for the November election against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's former co-chairman in the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He was a spokesman for the Trump campaign in 2020.
Saturday's ceremony in Holyoke was his 36th and his venue to use the city hall since Trump took office.
The participant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and that included a mother who was in charge".
Prisoners after the shooting of Sims of the LSU died
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU handball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m.
released a video of the shoot on Friday, asking for help to locate the man who appeared on the camera.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University on a Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result", police officer Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, about 247 games
He even intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being there, carrying a wound, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-to-6-step junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games starting 10 of the season, finishing with averages of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is about to win the world title after a runner-up wins the race over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear that Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday so much so that Mercedes' team would play a major part in the race.
From the pole, Bottas received a good offer and nearly defeated Hamilton in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team.
Vette went to the pits first and left Hamilton to run to the traffic at the tail of the pack, a spot that would separate her.
The Mercedes later mixed the tape and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a spin on the wheel so much that we saw the Ferrari driver unwittingly exit the car and survive a rough situation after a reverse turn to protect the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was on his 17th leg when he made the final lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for the most part by holding onto his tires to reach the finish line and then passing Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth time.
He eventually reached the quarterfinals with a 44th-place finish but was unable to raise his winery by the time Raikkonen finished fourth with eight remaining.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had done a fine job all weekend and was a real young man.
The team did a great job of having both".
The Evil Features of Flesh Language
President Donald Trump blamed Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting she did not break a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking in a West Virginia courtroom, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead pointing out that the incident in the White House showed that people were "cruel and sincere and untruthful".
"One thing that can happen and the best thing that happens in the last few days of the Great Depression is to see anger, to see people who are angry and cruel and cruel and dishonest", he said.
"If you watch the movie and you say, 'Oh, I haven't done it.
I have not done it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you crazy?
Remember his grandfather... he's been holding out the papers - "what, what, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I have not yet been able to do it".
In the case of a test, wait one minute.
Have we been... No, we are not", he added, with a sense of smell.
Feinstein received a letter explaining the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and he was beheaded in early September - but Feinstein denied that the break-in occurred in his office.
"I never concealed Dr. Ford's accusations, I never made a mistake", Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret".
But his denial was not well received by the president, who remarked on a speech in the Mgcibeo village that night: "I will tell you, that was a bad body language.
Perhaps not, but that is the most vicious body language I have ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the nominated Supreme Court, who accused three women of sexual misconduct, the president noted that the Democrats were using the allegations to achieve their goals.
"They are willing to restore their strength in the necessary ways.
He sees the cruelty, the cruelty, the indifference to whom they hurt, who they run to for power and control", reported the president's statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals against the Giants over Dundee
Dundee Stars are relegated from the Elite League on Friday to the Belfast Giants by winning the upcoming 5-3 game at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two goals early on with a touchdown from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the home plate before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's goals were successful.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came on as a late substitute in a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, where the Giants had won their previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game of the four-minute period at 3:35 p.m. was assisted by Kendall McFaull, where David Rutherford took the lead four times, double as Beauvillier.
During the busy opening season, Sullivan led the home side in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was the dustbreaker for Cownie's 15:16 mark.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants led the first half by scoring the second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home crowd was devastated, and Bouchard put them back on the podium with a hard goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee their first lead in the game in the second season and ensure a win where his team was fifth in the entire semi-final.
The Giants, who have now lost their last four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A Death Controller to Ensure More Aircraft Are Safe From Earthquakes
An Indonesian air traffic controller is honored as a hero after he died assuring the safety of hundreds of our passengers.
More than 800 people died and a tsunami struck after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday.
Recent remnants of the powerful earth continue to destroy the area, and many are suffering from the devastation of the city center of Palua.
But while his fellow workers fled to safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in a large, crowded cabin at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He sits there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the right track at the time, can fly safely.
Then he slipped out of the traffic control box in the sky, thinking that he was about to fall.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, reported that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Calimantan, to take her to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died that morning before the helicopter arrived in Palou.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll will reach thousands when the country's disaster relief agency says access to Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"The number is believed to be increasing as more bodies are still under the collapsed walls and more are not yet reached", said a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The six-meter-high waves that swept through Palu will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial vehicles will help.
"A minute after a minute, an ambulance brings bodies", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother to Sky News.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being crowded everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is urgently helping those who have survived but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be even worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the relief efforts.
Are you ready to do that?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, which killed 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Niugini Airlines now reports that a man has been missing after a plane crashed into the sea
A plane company that operated a plane that was scattered in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia says that a man has now disappeared, after all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
The Niugini Airline said that since Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to pick up a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Sichiwi Chuuk Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline had six passengers hospitalized on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of this turmoil and the sequence of events is still unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the sea shortly after takeoff.
Witnesses testified that the plane was moving in a direction that was not clear.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying too low
"That is a wonderful thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes asked him and others to draw the water from the sewer and to get out of the emergency door of the jet.
He says that the flight crew were shouting and shouting, and that the plane was badly damaged in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy Memorial, a group of Navy sailors who worked nearby to repair the shipyard also helped rescue the crew by using hot-water boats to transport passengers before the plane sank in water depths of 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in crashes of registered PNG aircraft over the past twelve years but none have included the Niugini Aviation Company.
A sculptor sets a night watch on the mother's body and burns her alive
The prosecution closed its case on Saturday in the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to link the departure of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the victim, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she had obtained location information from several different cell phones that indicated that Tellis had Chambers the night she died, which contradicted her earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed his cell phone that he was with Chambers at the time and that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford went out of the box on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he "was lying, because the car was in Nashville".
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said that she had been with Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett removed from her cell phone some time after Chambers' death texts, phone records, and contact details.
"He took her out of his life", Hale said.
A defense witness is scheduled to begin their lockdown on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to go to the assistant justice on the day of the hearing.
High-end: What is hip hop?
Three hip hop musicians want to add to the negative connotation of this genre by filling their music with a positive message.
The Bristol-based label, The Highest, says hip hop has shifted from its political roots to social media.
They want to go back to their roots without the hip hop that is trying to make a name for itself.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent survey in the UK of artists like Akal and Lowe.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny sues a couple after they fired her after a text "discriminating against race"
A babysitter in New York accuses a couple of men of discriminatory dismissal after a distorted text from the child's mother complained that she was "a black person".
The woman and the man deny that they were racially prejudiced, comparing the accusation to "a bribe".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was surprised to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman on her first day at work in 2016.
"NO BOOOOOOOOOO MAN", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When he realized his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who was "uncomfortable", fired Mr. Maurice, saying that the migrant babysitter, an African-American, had done a bad job and that he was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mr. Maurice was paid his day's wages and was taken home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing his mother and husband for cutting him off from work, and he wants to be paid $350 a day for six months, to stay at his job, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do anything like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's prejudice".
The woman and the man claimed that they were not prejudiced, saying that the right thing to do was to cut off Maurice's contract, fearing that they would not trust her after he had offended her.
"My wife sent me something she didn't understand.
He is not partial.
We are not discriminating", Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had wronged, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn?
Think about it".
Likening the dream of a "spoiled baby", Plasco said that his wife was two months pregnant and "in a very difficult situation".
"Will you do this to a man?
That is not the right thing to do", added the investment banker.
While the case was ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly removed the woman and the man from the social network, disagreeing on their conduct and their thinking.
Paddington's publishers feared that the readers might not be able to relate to the talking bear, showing a new book
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of it: "It is difficult to put it in someone's fingertips before it is first published.
It is a joy to know that we now know what Paddington's great success is".
She said her father, who worked as a photographer for the BBC before becoming interested in writing a children's toy book for a small bear, would have thought of the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "a sad and exciting event" after her death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who is described as "the most important member of the family", he added that his father was quietly proud of his accomplishments.
"He was a calm man, and he was not a proud man", he said.
"But because Paddington was honest with himself, it was almost like having a child who got something: you're proud of them even if you're not really doing it.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Despite his inventiveness and thoughtfulness, Paddington was often given credit".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were working to save her life but all was in vain.
"Nad was always on the phone saying that it was really bad, that he was unexpected", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"I called Nad and told her she was going to die within two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The doctors had given him the medicine to keep his heart beating.
He had died prematurely and was in the process of being buried.
I sat there and waited, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry out because I was in a situation where I was being held by family and friends.
I had to control myself".
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was still grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - ignoring the consequences.
"No one knew", he said.
"I lowered my head, and tears came out all the time.
It is difficult to explain, for he was alone in a situation where he and Nad had a wonderful feeling.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him".
A crying mother puts up suicide cards on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting cards on a Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he first developed a debilitating stroke and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to hear what I hear every day", she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, had a son who would be a chef and had a nice smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They often saw her smile illuminate the room".
Yet, before he died, he stopped working, as if "in a deep darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother when he killed himself.
"I go down every day, worried about the consequences", said Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis designed the cards to "let people know that there are people to whom you can go and talk, even if they are your friend.
Do not be silent - you must speak".
Mr. Humphreys, who had been a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"She didn't say she felt her breathing down or hurt or anything", he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
She had arrived at the end of the day on Khimush Day - when the children gave her gifts without looking at her eyes or looking at anything else".
He says that his death was a shock, but they must face it: "It has opened up a gap in this family.
It's right in the middle.
but we must keep living and fight".

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in doubt as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could find something that was different from what he was asking for - limited time for investigation, limited distance - perhaps we would take a little bit of cooperation", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "be foolish" even if it was closed.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not join the FBI?
Their refusal to accept the timing.
The midterm election is just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do wrong, they will be too weak in their efforts to get the candidate to the state's highest court.
George W. Bush was answering the phone and asking for support from Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, formerly Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
The vote will be held in the Democratic primary, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to withdraw the pension and secure his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans who left their country under Kim
The number of North Koreans who have fled to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, as South Korean lawmakers have done.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South's ministry of integration, said that 1,127 left their country last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park pointed to the control of the border between North Korea and China and the high tariffs on smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented on the nation.
Many of these refugees were eventually given to South Koreans.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has a long border, and North Korea is more easily reached than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The Chinese government says that those who leave their country are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often force them back.
Relations between the North and South - the rivalry - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss talks on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
This was demonstrated at a meeting in Singapore in May between U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed on broad terms to work to make Korea's watershed nuclear-free.
But on Sunday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. intelligence community of not making progress since then.
"Without trust in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we can put weapons first", said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "a little bit of a jerk", saying he is not ready to serve on the Supreme Court
House Leader of the Opposition Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "a jerk" who was not mentally fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi has commented on a interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I had no choice but to think that if a woman did this, they would say 'simply,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was emotionally overwhelmed, sometimes shouting and being kicked out of his room when he talked about his family and his years of high school.
He also sharply criticized the Democratic committee, saying the allegations against him were "baseless and a mockery of his reputation" orchestrated by angry liberal conservatives over Hillary Clinton's 2016 election defeat.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony would show that she could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that she was taking a neutral stand against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his speeches and the way he understands the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi refused when asked if she would try to charge Kavanaugh with fraud if confirmed, and when the Democrats found a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the courtroom right now", Pérez said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as Democrats, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade, which she viewed as a legitimate justice.
At the confirmation sessions, Kavanaugh asked questions about whether any of the Supreme Court's decisions had changed his mind.
"It's not the time for a cold-hearted person to take sides and go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not right,'" said Pelosi.
And the Mothers Should Have You Raise You.
It is a just verbal attack, months of years of raging anger, and it is not without tears.
"We cry when we are angry", said Mr. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
"I have been helped greatly by an elderly woman who cried when she was angry, but then devised a plan to make me angry and cry, and she would say to the person she was talking to, "You can imagine how sad I am when I cry.
I am angry".
Then he goes on.
And I thought that was a wonderful thing".
Tears are a legitimate means of expressing anger because they are not painfully expressed.
One of the best memories of my first job, in my father's office, where I once found myself crying bitterly, was that an elderly woman - a terrible boss I had always feared - grabbed me and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't make people see you crying", he said.
"They don't know that you're angry and you're just being rude.
They will think that you are sad and that they will be happy because they will think that they have found you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Republican from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair outside of his marriage on board a ship called the Project of the Blind and again left the campaign, Mr. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, felt that there was no reason to condemn the campaign for president himself.
"It was not a dream", she said with a laugh after 30 years.
"We had seven others who were already in the field, and the last thing they wanted was another.
One calls them "the White Virgin and the Seven Blind Ones".
By the time we left the campaign, he had lagged behind in raising the funds, and he decided to join the campaign only if he received $2 million.
it was a war that could not be won.
He found that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 had given him only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" he asked.
In his speech, he announced that he would not run for office in an organized manner, that he would not run for office in a political capacity - that he would be grateful to his supporters, that he would be frustrated by the process that made it so difficult to raise the funds and vote for the delegates, and that he would be outraged by the sexism - that he was fired.
"You would think I would be overwhelmed by the emotion", recalled Mr. Schroeder, reflecting on the response of the press.
"You would think Kleenex was my business partner.
I remember thinking, 'What will they put on my memorial stone?'
"Did you cry?"
Trade war with the United States and China could be a good thing for Beijing
The trade war between the United States and China was a disastrous one, and as the war is drawing to a close, the space between the two countries could be of great benefit to Beijing in the long run, says the expert.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning earlier this year by importing important Chinese products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest outbreak came this week when new tariffs affected $200 million in goods, which eventually caused half of the goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has also repaid each time in a different way, recently cutting tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to oppose the United States, and the economy of the second largest economy will not be in trouble anytime soon
Making Washington bow the horn means allowing strong demands, but if America's public bow would be a shame for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could reap China a long-term advantage by reducing the level of internal dependence on taxes.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a climate change in their country is more dangerous than what viewers have seen before", said Abigail Grace, a researcher with a focus on Asia at the New American Security Center, a think tank
Syria is "waiting" for refugees to return, says the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation
Syria says it is waiting for refugees to return and is asking for help to rebuild the country after seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Agriculture and International Cooperation Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the region is improving.
"Today the climate is more expensive and safer because of the progress made in the fight against malaria", he said.
The government continues to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to a normal state.
All circumstances now allow refugees to return to their homelands where they have been forced to flee because of the economic and social pressures that have been taken to control their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem has said that the Syrian government will accept aid for the reconstruction of the impoverished country.
But he stressed that there would be no limited aid or help from other countries that had supported the protests.
Europe finishes as runners-up in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the American team by 16.5 to 10.5 goals at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
Melika has now lost six straight European Championships and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe was crowned when the Danish team, led by Thomas Bjorn, scored 145 points to beat America.
American champion Phil Mickelson, who was tough throughout the tournament, hit his first shot and went down with a sixth hole of 3-16, giving up his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in every round, becoming the first of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was beaten 5-4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World champion Dustin Johnson finished 2nd and 1st behind Ian Poulter of England who would have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup winner, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, was the all-time winner of the Rupee with 25.5 points.
"I never used to cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for pointing me out and believing in me.
I am so happy to have that cup back.
It was about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, who was overwhelmed by the European title.
He passed the torch to his hometownman John Ram, who defeated U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's round robin.
"I'm proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, to have grown up watching him", said Rahm, 23.
Woods has not won any of his four games in France and now has a record of 13-23-1.
The rare figure is one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Grand Slams and finished second to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a better way, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played the highest level of golf in the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's humble performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
There was a time this morning when we were in a state of shock in Europe.
We are.
I give Thomas a hat.
He is a fine servant.
All 12 players are very good at their job.
We will meet again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will make progress.
I love those 12 young men and am proud to be a warrior.
You should raise your hat.
We have failed".
Recent Pollution of Seawater: Sea water pollution is decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
A new report by the Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a common decline in the number of people or the continuing pollution of seawater in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, patchier spreading conditions are worse in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier - indicating a decline in pollution.
Sea Water Pollution has increased by an estimated 130 miles [140 km] from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee Peninsula.
Small ones may be found 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in smaller areas than the previous week.
The pollution of the sea has been cleared and is evident in Pasco County.
Mean sea or off-shore temperatures in Pinellas County have been reported over the past week, high sea levels outside Hillsborough County, coastal to high sea levels in Manatee County, coastal or off-shore temperatures in Sarasota County, central sea levels in Charlotte County, coastal or off-shore temperatures in Lee County, and low sea levels in Collier County.
There are also reports of neck problems in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No neck ailment was reported in Northwest Florida in the final report.
