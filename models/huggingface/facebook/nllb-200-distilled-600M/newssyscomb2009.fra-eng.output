Right-wing populists in Austria have won 29 percent of the vote
The preliminary results showed that the early parliamentary elections in Austria had brought a significant weakening of the two parties that make up the current grand coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
The electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain the country's top political force, with 29.8 percent of the vote, but compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent, ended up even worse.
This is the worst result of the two major postwar parties; particularly for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters were clearly punishing them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation was raised about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary meeting of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the way to the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPÖ) would have won 18 percent and the BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the socialists at the same time expressed fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, the BZÖ split in 2005) on a common government, which even prompted sanctions from the European Union.
Mr Haider, who has already said he is ready to work with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna on the national political scene, apparently focused on this development.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
Clearly, no other party has passed the four percent threshold and has not entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegally harvesting cockroaches is not solved, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg says, then the Czech-Indian relations will become somewhat cooler.
The minister said this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem were not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur", he said after the meeting, which was held on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherjee said, in the course of the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
He did however mention that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, as the case was placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
Mukherjee said the best solution for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then apply for bail and wait for the trial on bail, he explained.
Mr Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed the same opinion during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he may be pardoned", says the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been given to them by India.
"We want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomology.
"We consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers a great contempt", he said.
The Minister avoided the question of whether he had obtained from India the promise to take care of the case.
"I've already received quite a number of promises", he noted only.
A Czech referee in the sea floor fight
He is approaching an electronic wall map, which depicts Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent, but a little lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself", says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30 members of the UN's Ocean and Law Division.
Its head, the head of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, occasionally follows the presentation and the complete report.
The atmosphere is characterized by hard work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a world that is little known until now, rich in natural resources.
It contains oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider depth than the dry land
The coastal states have begun to aspire vigorously to new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are indeed exercising their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially true of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively all the resources of the continental shelf.
'For simplicity' the part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continental shelf under the sea is considered continental shelf.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often also beyond the 200 nautical miles that represent the exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request by the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous surveys and costly measurements.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific and technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far only the last three countries have been successful", Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, as the first country to significantly expand its underwater holdings, has recently been a global phenomenon.
New Zealand has also gained territory - the area of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometers, six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The future benefits they will derive from exploiting the seabed will be, as they imagine, priceless.
Gradually, other countries will submit their applications.
They can do so within 10 years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, proclaimed by convention a "common heritage of mankind".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right to extract in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, let us not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike", says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, adding that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime is grounded in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the Joint Organisation 'Interoceanmetal'.
In 1991, the Convention granted it, along with investors from a few other States, the status of a "pioneer investor".
It has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area sought by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moving, it's a kind of submerged replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to mine on a land area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another jurist, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of such a realization.
It reminds me of a little potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene to free the hostages.
The Egyptian government had sought the help of Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation got serious, the special units were ready but never went into action.
More and more details are being revealed about the circumstances surrounding the release of eleven European tourists abducted from Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also took an indirect part in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the federal army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police and Criminal Police Federal Squadron, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk were at the release site.
As the Ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not required, as the hostages released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened until now", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped a group of tourists in southern Egypt, including five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight Egyptian travelers.
After being kidnapped in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained unclear until now, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
At the moment, no information has been given in Berlin on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and the special forces are expected to have taken off on an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue plan.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has almost failed the $700 billion financial market bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was sinking to the bottom.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout plan in favor of financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program to contain the chaos in financial markets failed to win a majority.
In a dramatic move, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the good-founded opponents of this heavy $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a vote of no confidence in the House, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened", he admitted.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state bailout could be overturned.
He went back shortly before the vote ended, and then, after the failure was announced, fell again.
Experts now project further serious turmoil in international financial markets.
The programme must be approved and approved by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate before it can enter into force.
The organisers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of bookings for the coming months, according to one study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the low economic outlook, the German desire for travel remains insatiable, according to this study.
As regards winter bookings, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31% compared to the same period the previous year, as reported by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, rising booking figures are already dominating the autumn months.
Thus sales would have increased by about 11 per cent more compared to 2007, DRV said.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyses booking data from 1200 travel agencies on a monthly basis and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
The low dollar price would make travel to the US particularly demanding, the DRV said.
The increase in reservations there would be about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be particularly sought after by the Germans.
The demand for organised travel is particularly high, said Dr. Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
In view of rising energy and food prices, costs here would be "easier to calculate for the customer than for an individual trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very favourable, so that sales figures will again increase from last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Party
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski on a continuous basis, from beer in pint-sized pinchers to celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
It's a beer party event.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, TV host, and wears a custom-made Tyrol costume.
I'm a black-haired student, and my dress is a second-hand one.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes before the beer party, and already the photographers are jumping at us and filling out their memory card - very flattering, and that's on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean suit seems to be achieving its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and a normal resident north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in traditional costume was until now limited.
But once you get to Thérèse Square, everything is half the same.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrol suit or leather pants; no one looks puffy or disgraced - that's perfectly normal.
Only the patch of my Tyrolean suit gets a few weird eyelashes at the chocolate banana stand.
A Bavarian woman tells me that I would have tied my apron wrong: "left means free, middle means virgin, right means married, back means widow".
I'm discreetly tripling my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better", she said, laughing.
Others don't take as much as they do for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple feathers that say "Too drunk to get dressed!" and show us their naked backpack without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", with a "ooooo" stretched out.
He tells me all this after he's relieved himself of the booze he'd had before.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild-biters".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, a bunch of rescue workers run to the party square to take care of the poor drinkers.
Instead, the nurses come in packs - always four in a row, dragging their mattress covered in tents.
That's how it works for most beer party visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who lie in the coffin of the drunken under the sheath are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore", one of the rescuers shouted in response to my question and then disappeared into the mix.
Police identified the victim of an accident
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released on bail ever since.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was considering joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is mounted at the back of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its corners, as some German provincial town halls do.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the enterprise, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that reached Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the cold war's frozen borders, is over.
The British and Imperial forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof .
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling into ruin, engulfed in the mystery of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points is at least symbolically used to highlight Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, caused by the cold war's frozen borders
Now it's time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the experts on foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken by noisy railroads that reminded me of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new century, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and Washington in particular.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and many pastry shops where middle managers in suit-and-tie-dress - men and women - meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
He's got a suit, a tie, and he even has a black berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its home country.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
Neither of us was.
She had to do both.
But then, at some point, I asked if Turkey should not choose.
"Turkey", he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two".
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I spoke with has recited to me by heart: the Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the railways to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched the building being built 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could be largely in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the time when Turkey had been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already starting his musical project for the city, he founded the following year the fantastic youth choir Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 - refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the choir's willingness and ability to handle any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and that was thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod used to tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants".
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His technique of the wand was absolutely clear, precise, though never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the musical standard, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver should be knighted, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me -- and, a few times, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of personal grandeur and modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "focused only on certain people".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while he was pursuing a BSc, MA and PhD".
That's what came out of a letter from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and was also completing a PhD thesis on the British Rubber Industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and '51s in the United States, he studied at the Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition Flamenco and Life because his black and white photography, a documentary style, is fantastic.
I was drawn to them because of their simplicity and the power they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
A show that conveys a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments".
Second assault on the super sales of Honda
In November, Honda will begin the second generation of the Jazz model.
While its predecessor already had a good housing capacity, this new single-volume has even larger interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
A change from a revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz is aesthetically similar to the previous model, there are many changes to the new Honda Jazz.
Among them are innovative design, new platforms, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before we examine the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched on the market.
First, we notice that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, it is a selling phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly a million Honda Jazzs have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it is planning to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch officials hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will enable Honda to largely offset the drop in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand's executives hope to end the year with 22,000 cars sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decline of 16 percent.
With this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
The Insight is a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - with the Japanese company hoping to sell nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, with the remaining half being distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first three months of next year, following its public launch in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz is increasing in size.
Its length is 3.90 meters (an additional five centimeters), its width 1.69 meters (an additional two centimeters), and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remains the same, at 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and so is the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a central gasoline reserve, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a dual bottom system  can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the 1.4L version, since the capacity of the 1.2L Honda Jazz trunk is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improved access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, in contrast to the rear doors of the first Jazz which opened at an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercial launch, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology which reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power output of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared with the previous engine, which in the previous generation had 83 horses, it is now up to 100.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It's called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and it represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have designed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bees' eyes, which can see at an angle of over 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterrupted within their own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles at a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by twisting its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other system in existence is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow, and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device only has to process information and act on that data.
It doesn't need to store the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabyte".
This is the first car to develop new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into production cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They're afraid of being mortgaged
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into mortgage lending with credit unions, they created a game to learn how not to go broke: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the bad credit hotel or stories.
The sadness of this house and especially the Hotel Master makes us think over and over whether this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it.
I'm sure this game gives us some useful information but little in detail.
It's not a teenage game anymore.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, to pay out $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% below the carrying amount of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29 or 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock was down 6.79% to $23.07 at around 5:00 p.m.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to holding bank status", explained John Mack, the group's managing director in the US.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its operations but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms of the deal, which were announced on Monday, also show that the deal has been amended in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago", explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, in Tokyo, "we thought that participation would be entirely made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their carrying amount.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG can convert half of its preferred securities into common shares within one year if they are traded more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had "carefully" eased its balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock price melt by half as the cost of insurance against default on its debt skyrocketed.
This cost declined on Monday but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch takeover, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To rebuild the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he was the third to vote on a new constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted 'yes' to the referendum, according to official results with 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" vote was 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white.
For the draft Constitution to pass, he had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls outside polling stations and a countdown by a non-governmental organisation announced a widespread "yes" victory, with 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed victory over his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly", he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the governorate headquarters in Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was praised by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place quietly under the watchful eye of the Organization of American States (OAS), was on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution gives the state power over the economy, reserving it for the "development planning" of a country that lives primarily on oil extraction by foreign companies and the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The draft, which was led by Correa, elected in 2006, also gives the head of state increased powers, which can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and have the option of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also reinforces the principle of free health and education that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
It also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive for ten days in the desert were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
The hostages arrived in good shape at around 3.30pm on a special plane at the al-Maza military base, which is being hosted at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are "in good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, said Egypt's Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4×4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages had been roamed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It included 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, which organises the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces personnel, who were flown on two helicopters, had launched the attack in the night just before dawn.
"A mutual exchange of fire took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled", said the official, who asked not to be identified.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Lightning Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned the role of secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces in Belgrade, where he is based.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence, special forces men", he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is taking hold this election campaign.
- That's good.
But one aspect of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the misery caused by the small museums, archives, archaeological digs, or the starving national historic sites?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the only Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with the excavation of history, preserving under three private archival heaps and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guard dogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and policymakers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a historical and heritage grandstand?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, the first European bank in crisis following the snowball effect of the US credit market crisis, by partially nationalising it.
This weekend the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level on this issue, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been widening for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, including, first of all, the mainly insurance activities it acquired last year from the Dutch body ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying slump, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of a crisis were already revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell 12 percent, to their lowest level in 14 years.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two thirds of its value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's executives, is unrealistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty over the Atlantic over the adoption of the $700 billion US bailout plan of being behind the collapse of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the paper price already enjoyed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors should not worry, they will not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in a chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate based on information about his or her drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There are data protection programmes which link the use of prescription information in all cases to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like giving your chicken to a fox", Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions, told The Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insurance capital for damage, the health of the client who is present, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent applicants to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after learning the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is easily available from pharmacies, data on the person's drug purchases in the last eighteen months, and from that the program itself determines what disease the person is suffering from and what his health status is.
For example, if a person regularly purchases high doses of cholesterol-lowering medication, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this programme are in circulation, some of which simultaneously determine a risk factor, so there is little left for the insurer to do other than paperwork.
Among the disadvantages of this program is that a drug can be used for different purposes, such as some mixtures can be used for migraine or heat stroke, but they can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others are not.
Companies have developed in data research and analysis, and they must seek patient permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
They are now forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past wrongdoing.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is also becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope is limited to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on widening the scope of the authorities' control over data-providing companies is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and therefore has further developed his programme, which would make data transmission subject to the exclusive consent of the data subject.
The question is whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurers do not sign an insurance contract with him.
So, in the end, the chickens depend on the fox's kindness.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme was also on the agenda of the ninth summit alongside other problems, largely global.
Today there will also be a France-India summit where cooperation in the field of nuclear energy will be discussed.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given wider say in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi's candidacy for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
They did not, however, spend too much time on this issue yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the current President of the European Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Head of the Foreign Affairs Office, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that within five years they would double trade, which would mean an increase of some 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious target.
In this respect, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation, so that air trade can also flourish in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009 at the latest.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's leading trading partner, and New Delhi, the only EU partner in the ninth position.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this issue has been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also called for, although both play a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate programme, including a target of reducing its toxic emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as the need to pass a global market at the next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent food prices from rising and supported the call for an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is today in the French capital, where he is preparing to sign a bilateral agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, French companies are expected to receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal is for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international rights-exchange event.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to attract more than 7 000 exhibitors from 101 countries, occupying the 171.790 square metres of the fair with over 403 000 titles on display, and Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Heritage, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Butterfly.
It will be followed by a press meeting in the Room Struktur, in the 5.0 Butterfly at the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects for the publishing industry's position in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, to that for adults and children.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The plane wreckage of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau 3,000 meters above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, no human remains, though.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson cleared the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is indeed the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared", he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) reported that hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the plane: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing Fosset's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned himself a place in history through a long series of records.
On his sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world flight on a balloon - a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without stopping.
Among all the records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 with an original, well-defined design, marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
In short, Glk, the last of the star house's "compact" off-road cars, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new lease on the industry.
It is precisely through its unconventional, unexpected and unconventional content that the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from 17 October.
The advertising slogan that will accompany the launch of the new car will thus lead to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping centre, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
You'll get the impression that when you look at the picture, the car is out of the billboard.
Then, through the use of innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glk will be illuminated by spots, in all its details, and then reassembled into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
The Commission has already decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the budgetary procedure.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
They're coming from Triveneto, they're risking the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which until now has never created any major problems.
Nor had he ever run into any rival tifosi.
The group extraction is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (in fact few) from Campania and Puglia joined.
They had three-color flags showing their hometown: Saturday night, they were all kidnapped to hide their identity.
They're inspired by the English typhus.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhoid-type of real Nazis, the Levski.
The Italian team had made available 144 tickets for the match, all nominative and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not travel.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the riots serve a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits people from going to Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer be on the stage.
I'm glad you did.
But now it's time for a fearsome emulation, so that others may add to the first hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who is acting like this", Viminal argues.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for Wednesday's national team game in Lecce"
In fact, there is a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italia in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which are just dealing with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during the Mameli anthem?
This is the view (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took over from Francesco Tagliente and then from Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the prefect of Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to hire Mussolini, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhosis sufferers was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observer No. 1, "the crimes must be attributed to the country in which they occur.
So far, this group has been in the rules, so now we'll look at what happened, and we'll evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling to the Mameli anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you'll excuse me, they're not polite... "
