Welsh AMs worried about 'how to look stupid'
There was a risk of disruption among some AMs over the decision to change their status to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Assembly).
It was triggered by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Assembly.
AM in the political sphere is very concerned that it could lead to ridicule.
A Labour MP said the group was concerned "it is collaborating with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means crazy and pwp means percentage.
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole did not feel comfortable and suggested options.
A Welsh conservative commentator said the band had "nothing in mind" about changing the name, but noted it was a brief transition from MWP to Muppet.
In this case, the Welsh w is pronounced similarly to the Yorshire English u.
The Council Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to propose the name change, said: The final decision on any specific matters referred to the members of the Council will remain a matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the resolution which received broad support to convene the Welsh Assembly.
On the issue of naming the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP's choice received the most support in a public debate.
The AMs are clearly suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be difficult for the Supervisory Board, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the changes in weeks.
The bill on the amendments will include other changes to the functioning of the council, including provisions on the declassification of AMs and the structure of the committee.
AMs will have the final say on what they will be called when they debate the bill.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular election was held in an attempt to resolve an annual dispute with neighboring Greece, which had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly refused to apply for membership in the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a vocal opponent of direct elections to change the name, said he would abandon the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Bell Silenced by Harlem Halls in Crisis
 Historically, the elderly people I spoke to said there was a bar and a synagogue on every corner, said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none.
He said that the disappearance of a drunk is understandable.
People are having a different kind of leisure these days, he said.
Bars are no longer the side rooms where people go regularly.
In the case of the churches, he was concerned that the proceeds from the sale of properties would not last as long as the authorities expected, and that sooner or later they would return if they did.
He added that churches and apartment buildings will be replaced with large, crowded halls that will not support other shelters for the homeless.
Most people who would buy large spaces in these buildings would be white, he said, and so they would rush the day when these churches would be declared closed altogether because it is more likely that these people who moved into these large spaces would become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white people before Harlem became a black community - the City Community in 1870, a decade after St. Martin's.
The white Methodist movement emerged in the 1930s.
A devout black group that worshipped nearby took over the building.
The St. Martins were led by a group of devout blacks under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led businesses to avoid shopping on the 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which was committed to hiring workers or supporting blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild, they opened the auditorium with a musical instrument.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the church's musical instruments "the bells of the common people".
The expert who sounded the alarm in July called it something different: A treasure trove of cultural heritage and an irreplaceable artifact.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first musical instrument sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the grand piano at Riverside Hall 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace it.
What appeared at St. Martin's a few months ago was a hoax of artists and contractors, some brought in by uneducated church leaders, others from the jurisdiction of the Episcopal bishop.
Then the vestry committee - the governing body of the synagogue district, which included uneducated officials - wrote to the archbishop in July with their concerns that the synagogue district would ask to hand over the expenses to the vestry committee, even though the vestry committee was not required to hire the architects hired by the district's contractors.
Some members complained about the lack of transparency regarding the area around the synagogue.
A giant shark wounds a 13-year-old lobster hunter in California
A large shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was hunting for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming and he went to the scene with a group of men to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a lozenge that had caught a losbter, but then he realized that it was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
His shoulderbone was completely open, Hammel said when he arrived at the boy's place.
I called out to everyone to get out of the water. Hammel added, "There's a big fish in the sea!"
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of the giant fish that attacked the reef is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles of the conservation group told reporters that a large shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not from another species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to the upper part of his back.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Bay in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for search and rescue purposes.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of large fish in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's prepares to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's employs Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams along with a department store chain that employs a team of professional assistants.
As part of the entry into the £2.8 billion UK cosmetics market, which continues to grow despite the decline in the jewellery and home furnishings trade, major cosmetics units will be tested in 11 stores across the country and taken to more stores next year if the trend is successful.
Investment in the beauty industry is coming as supermarkets scramble to make use of the empty space that once held television sets, kitchen appliances, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its cosmetics range to nearly 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current line of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have local variations of the same sizes as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its trendy range so that most products are vegan-friendly - something that is gaining increasing demand for smaller shoppers.
In addition, the perfume giant will be testing discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The rise of online shopping and the decline in the daily shopping for small meals at local convenience stores means that supermarkets must be more active in attracting more visitors.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said the side shops will continue to be like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been running Argos's side stores in hundreds of stores as well and has introduced several Habitats since acquiring their entire catalog two years ago, which it says has further enhanced the grocery business there and made the acquisition more profitable.
Attempts to recycle used packaging have been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a business partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger came to an end after a dispute over how to divide the revenues from the drugstore into its own supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
He said Llyods would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded line of luxury skincare products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director of Sainsbury's said: "We have changed the look and feel of the cosmetics department to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in our specially trained colleagues who would be nearby to advise.
Our range of products is designed to suit every need and the attractive surroundings and convenient facilities mean a destination for attractive fashion that challenges the old fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby walks out of £11 million contract
Dragons star Den Peter Jones goes 'in the saddle' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby exits an £11 million contract with her business-like lifestyle to re-enter her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time for their household chores and Truly's supplies.
Their business was associated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning, took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby leaves Dragons' star Peter Jones angrily saying she will be leaving their lucrative business model at the end of the season - to face her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Footage said Jones was "angry" when the TV star confirmed during a heated discussion on Tuesday at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she now had little time to waste on their home goods and Truly branded promotions.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is said to have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane and passed one of his vacation homes.
One writer said: Truly is at the top of Holly's list of priorities.
It would be a long journey ahead of her than she would have in years to come.
The sentence of expulsion left all in the situation in shock.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, just before the dedication.
There was a large warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters that were ready to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most successful stars, will cost the company millions due to over-investment in products from pillows to candles to clothing and home furnishings, and possible delays in its launch.
And he will give the final explanation of a tall friend.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as CEO in March.
The couple often vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night We will not comment on his business dealings.
The main topic And that's when we started dating
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unfitting for the president" and for having a positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said in his voice he was insulting the "newsman".
I have left nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second round of talks after their first in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step towards denuclearization in North Korea.
But the nuclear arms control treaties have not been successful.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "response" from the United States to the North Korean nuclear arms reduction initiative.
In retrospect, he noted, the US continued to impose sanctions with the intention of maintaining pressure.
Trump took a view that he felt was possible in his rally speech.
"Everything is going well for us with North Korea", he said.
We would have gone to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
And now we have this great bond.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and getting the rest of the US military corpses back home.
He also defended his approach in a similar manner in his speech and interaction with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this huge space, we'll have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia: Tsunami and earthquake devastate island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a condition for international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenge, said Ms. Sumbung.
When Save the Children put together a group to go to Palu, it was not sure if foreign workers could work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were monitoring the situation in Palu to see if international representatives would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
With the earthquakes that are common in Indonesia, the country has become very unprepared for life's disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they have not become visible in coastal areas.
The lack of tsunami warning in Palu, although a warning was in effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, the connection between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
The divine messengers often made the distribution of supplies extremely difficult.
A ship hospital in Lombok was on its way to Palu to treat the victims, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has turned the restoration of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure into a priority of his election campaign, and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has crippled Mr. Joko's government as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from the rise of religious intolerance and anti-consumerism, where the majority Muslim community has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left homeless as Christian and Muslim guerrillas fought in the streets, using spears, bows, and other lethal weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has drawn a horse's ear against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool from a Premier League challenge cup match where they lost to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards outside of a 1-0 win over Chelsea.
He touched the ball to his left before making another pass to the distance.
The attempt to move the box over the top of the box and down to the top right corner of the stern.
The ball finally fell on top of Kepa Arrizabalaga's leaping shoulder and into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com that It was just another attempt to get in there, to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to create for myself as much time as possible.
I saw Kante coming and he touched me once and I didn't think about it too much so I just knocked.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the first half after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic again in the match, before he rushed into the middle of the field and scored in Liverpool's half.
Kovacic immediately made another jump and ran into the middle of the field.
Then he made another good shot, pushing Hazard into the box.
Hazard passed the goalkeepers and finished in the long-range goal position with a left foot passing Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool played Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League Challenge Cup at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake rose to 832, the country's disaster management agency said early Sunday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on Friday caused a massive collapse of buildings and caused a tsunami of 20 metres, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
Palu, a city of over 380,000, is a ruin of a series of bridges.
 Police arrested 32-year-old man on suspicion of killing woman by stabbing
An investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55am with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area to come and see if they had seen or heard anything.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: The investigation is in its very early stages but I would appeal to anyone around John's Line in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything unbelievable to contact us.
I would also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have been photographed by the front-of-car camera to contact us because surprisingly they may have information of importance to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today afternoon, friends who believed in the woman's identity went to the scene to ask questions about where she had been that morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police say they are preparing to inform the family of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The inhabitants were told that it would take hours before they were allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared there, tears welling up in her eyes.
She kept repeating It's scary.
At 2 pm two police cars collided with only one truck outside.
Some officers stood in the blockade to inspect the area of the houses.
Anyone with information is requested to send via DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Prevention Service privately on 0800 555 111 using the 247 hotline dated 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliament became the latest monument to the struggle to rewrite history
Green will be held accountable for the same destruction of British monuments, culture and religion as the Taliban did to its radical followers.
But the Cromwellian people described Mr. Crick's decision as "stupid" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwellian League, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate over the removal of the statue that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace will be a target of attack.
Attacking the outstanding battles of the English Civil War was not an order or an act of Cromwell.
Perhaps the most dismal thing to come after Cromwell was the exploits of his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
There is a great deal of information about Cromwell's Sa William Hamo Thorneycroft that is a 19th-century argument for the existence of a historical figure that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more so in the last decades of the 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in the inevitable conflict with the monarchy.
Whether that explanation is anything entirely accurate remains a matter of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the crisis of the mid-17th century set the stage for our country's subsequent prosperity, and Cromwell was a well-known figure who represented one side of that crisis.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered.
Chinese farmer killed by pig
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man was identified only by his nickname "Yuan", which was found in a woman with a severed neck vein, all covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining and Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly went to the market with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his nephew found a woman, and he saw an open door to a pigsty.
He said that in the barn was found a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A scientific investigation of the incident confirmed that a 550-pound pig crushed the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My nephew's legs were covered in blood and bent", the nephew said, using his nickname Wu as a nickname, as reported by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to give food to his friends.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A store manager told the Evening News that the pig was covered up to prevent it from attacking another person, while the police were also gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly in talks to pay compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been instances of pig attacks on humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer's tent until his wife frightened the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his friends in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not particularly aggressive but the taste of blood could be a factor.
They were just playing.
They are addictive, curious... not out to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains to the southwestern United States
As predictions indicate, Hurricane Rosa is getting weaker as it moves over the icy waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the days ahead.
Rosa had winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. on Sunday Eastern time, and was spotted some 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tropical wave began to form over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast.As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a major hurricane it will begin to push a heat wave northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the heat wave combined with the tides that are facing it will create a downpour that will reach much of the southwest in the days ahead.
Indoors, 1 to 14 inches of rainfall will cause severe flooding, fossil run-off and possible landslides in the desert.
Extreme heat waves can cause rainfall estimates of 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
There is a risk of uncontrolled flooding as the climate is becoming more and more volatile due to the increasing rainfall in the tropics.
It is a bad idea to go out into the wilderness and see the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn lakes into floodplains and torrential rains can create dust and dust clouds.
The coming hailstorm will bring heavy rainfall to parts of Southern California's coast.
There is a possibility of a total rainfall of over one inch, which will cause a small amount of debris to flow and the roads to be slippery.
This would be the first of the provincial winter rains.
Tropical thunderstorms will begin to hit Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rainfall becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
The Arctic is likely to experience extreme weather in October as the temperature in the Americas rises, but the tropics will remain warm.
At times this may lead to dramatic changes in circumstances over a period of time.
There is another great example of the amazing variety of weather through central America on Sunday.
There is a difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build and expand again.
Much of central and eastern America is expected to see a warmth beginning in October with a random 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is at least 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of moderate weather for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the damning testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual assault victim in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political unrest continued, with the media interrupting the regular schedule for a Friday night late shift: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had picked her up drunk and tried to strip her at a high school prom.
Kavanaugh, in a harsh testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
No wonder more than 20.4 million people in the Nielsen report watched it.
The company calculated the average viewership figures by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No demographics were immediately available for other networks that aired the show, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often had trouble measuring the number of people they watched in their offices.
To put it bluntly, that's the same as the number of viewers at a basketball game that you won at the Academy Awards.
Fox News, which was strongly supported by commentators, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was high after the hearing.
Flake is the central figure in the Friday night drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras showed him on Friday yelling at protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the top floor of the House Judiciary Committee.
He stood face down for several minutes as the screaming was broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, you are all powerful when most women are weak.
Flake said his office had released information and said, before the elevator closed, that he had a lot to say to the committee.
Cable networks and broadcasters all aired the episode during the later broadcast, as the House Judiciary Committee was voting to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for another vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the named suspect next week, which is what the Democratic minority is hoping for.
Flake was content with a few singles and interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several senators later, Flake reached his verdict.
Flake's vote was strong, as it was clear that Republicans would not get enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without a referendum.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh scandal.
British Prime Minister May criticizes Brexit critics and politics
Prime Minister Theresa May criticized critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political reversal" of Britain's future and insulting the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In an interview prior to the front-page coverage, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson denounced his attack on her Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the European Union should adopt each other's currency was "completely false".
Shot Wayde Sims Dyteon Simpson arrested by police on suspicion of murdering LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the documentary between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene where they also claimed to have found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB report.
After questioning Simpson, police said he pleaded guilty to the fatal shooting of Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate report.
The East Baton Rouge Homicide Investigator's Office released an initial report on Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department commended Louisiana State Police officers who worked to apprehend the fugitive, the state's Criminal Science Laboratory, Southern University Police and local residents for assisting in the investigation that led to the murder.
LSU ski director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their commitment to justice.
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch tall was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and recovered a 2.6 rebound in a season ago.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what people are worried about all the time", Wade said.
A huge volcano spewed ash over Mexico City
A hail of ash from the massive Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after the eruption peaked and recorded 183 tons of greenhouse gas emissions and ash for more than 24 hours.
The center monitors earthquakes and landslides.
Photos on social media showed thin patches of ash dripping on car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Meteorologists have observed additional activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano called "Don Goyo" has been erupting continuously since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan independence protesters ahead of independence rally
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters rallied with riot police, and as thousands joined a counter-demonstration to mark the anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia on secession.
A group of blindfolded revolutionaries arrested by the police were pelted with stones and sprayed with powdered paint, creating a dark cloud in the streets that were often crowded with tourists.
Violence broke out later that day when police used their clubs to stop the fighting.
For more than several hours, pro-independence mobs chanted No forgetting, no apologizing clashed with pro-union protesters chanting, God save Spain.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Violence is still high in the province that has been at the heart of the Liberation movement a year after the referendum on October 1 that Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan independence activists are celebrating.
Voters voted heavily in favour of Independence although it was not so much that those who did not want to be excluded abstained.
According to Catalan authorities at least 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to disrupt polling stations across the province in a violent stampede.
Mobs of pro-liberal protesters marched outside at night in support of the national police.
The protests continued but she was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, 68, a journalist who attended the independence protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped to see Catalonia gain independence.
Last year was one of our best.
I watched my parents cry for the opportunity to vote but now we are stuck in it", he said.
Despite holding a significant and decisive victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to keep up this year's campaign with many of their prominent leaders either seeking asylum or being detained awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support protest on his phone, said the riots were met with anger from politicians on all sides.
It's getting dirtier and dirtier, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would stand in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to resist the backwardness of the democratic values and tyranny we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Two men, aged 33, 34 and 29, were arrested after a van was driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Assistant Superintendent Bob Blemmings said that the doors and his own home were damaged.
The bugs were also sometimes shot at the van.

Livingston's promotion surprised Rangers by saving Steven Gerrard to his second goal in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack was the turning point as Gary Holt's side moved flat with Hibernian in the second leg.
Gerrard's side are without a win-loss record in the Premiership this season and will face Leaders Hearts, who are eight points clear, next Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livinsgton, have increased their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste the beat since he replaced Kenny Miler a month ago.
Livingston lost control of their visitors and gave them no chance
Holt's side were arguably ahead of the game, with their opponents causing Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson entered but pulled his effort to the front of the grid to win, the only one Alan Lithgow could face with his effort after a down to meet a drunken Craig Halkett.
The goalkeepers agreed to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could be a nuisance to the visitors on the home stretch.
And that is how an important meal took place.
Rangers conceded an unblocked hit and Livingston worked up another opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to score Menga, who touched and scored from the middle of the box.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the ball holding but found the home defense would not allow a pass and catcher Liam Kelly was completely unconcerned.
This situation continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman missed a leg by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow opened strongly from a play-off set by Livingston.
Then came the whole of the drinking that was going on in Livingston's box and the continuation of their treatment, when the drinking was coming from the head and the goal - after challenging Halkett to replace Glenn Middleton, and one to touch the hand - was pushed aside.
Surprise  from Livingston - study
Alasdair Lamont Scotland in the area of Tony Macaroni
A remarkable game and a reward for Livingston.
For one man, they were so impressed, they went beyond what was expected of this celestial creature.
Their attitude towards the staff has changed somewhat since their return to the top, but the main credit should go to Holt and the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many giants.
Captain Halkett was prepared, where he had arranged a good defense, while Menga had Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet.
The Rangers almost lost their nerve, almost.
Despite their excellent times under Gerrard, they failed to achieve such consistency.
Their final goal was not enough - they only cut the edge of the field once - and it was a refreshing call-up for Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a different reception in Cologne
Varied smiles and a blue sky were seen on Saturday (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
On her final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - designed to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have had disagreements on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the European Union.
Erdogan then passed through Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a crowd of about 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - mostly Kurds - raised their voices, applauding Erdogan's decision and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests there reflect the divisive nature of the arrival of a visitor who was hailed by German Turks as a hero and by the others as a puppet.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a van in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened months after a cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Road, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and buses diverted, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six officers were injured in a riot at a high security men's prison, the Prisons Bureau said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialists from the "Tornado" were brought in to deal with the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was reduced to one section.
The officers were treated for facial injuries at the scene.
According to a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections: Specialised and trained staff have been deployed to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for their injuries.
We don't expect violence in our prisons, and they said that those involved would be sent to jail and could spend a long time behind bars.
The HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison warden received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police responded to a violent incident in which workers were attacked with footballs.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and rising floods (Droughty areas likely)
It is unlikely that a heat wave will hit Arizona, but this is what could happen early next week as the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosan moves inland across the Southeast Desert, creating rising flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, pushing into late Monday with heavy rain.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service noted in a Twitter post that only 10 extreme weather events have produced a tropical cyclone or a tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The most recent National Hurricane Center models forecast 2 to 4 inches of rain, with an average of 6 inches less in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are not unusual to have 1 to 2 inches with a total gap of up to about 4 inches possible.
For those not at risk of rising floods, the Rosa rainfall may be a blessing in disguise since the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of this rainfall will be beneficial as the Southwest is now experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Weather Bureau, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa passed through the Baja California Basin of Mexico.
Rosa, still a strong tropical storm on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and was moving at 12 miles per hour.
The ice melts into the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and sinks.
As a result, it is expected to hit the ground in Mexico in the heat of the summer and in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Not surprisingly, the rains in parts of Mexico became heavy, creating another risk of severe flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to southwestern Sonora, according to weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as the final hurricane of the season, before moving up through Arizona and into southern Itah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
This water is expected to produce torrential rains and precipitation in the desert, and erosion in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three other children and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found with injuries in the Excelsior Square area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon on Monday night by Somerset Police.
The authorities asked anyone who might have a small video of the incident on a mobile phone to come.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered, was cruel, angered by the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and hardline policies of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered the "cruel, unyielding anger" of the Democratic Party by running for office.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and angrily denying a false statement from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford herself testified at the hearing about her invention.
The president said on Saturday afternoon that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's skill and courage that day".
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh West is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished jurists alive today, a jurist with an outstanding record of public service", West Virginia supporters said in a public forum.
The president made a brief reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the benefits of Republican candidates in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I will not stop, but I will actually stop", he said.
That's why I'm always fighting for the top candidates.
Trump in the debate  Democrats are on a policy of anti-burka.
The first major step toward a Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a top aide to the GOP chairman told CNN.
Hundreds die in Indonesia earthquake, and death toll increases
At least 384 people were killed, including passengers, when a powerful tsunami and earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday as high waves (of 18 inches) hit the beach at night, washing away many dead and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by another quake of magnitude 7.
When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were busy on the coast and did not immediately flee where they became the victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesia's BNPB risk reduction agency in a brief interview with reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami came on its own, pulling cars, logs, houses, and hitting everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled over the open ocean at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos taken by the emergency services showed buildings and shops in ruins, curved bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The previously stormy storm that had ravaged the coastal city on the Sabbath had continued.
A series of earthquakes was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Weights and Measures (BPPT) in a statement said the magnitude of the earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the magnitude of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The atmosphere of the city, which sits at the end of a narrow, long channel, may have contributed to the magnitude of the tsunami, she said.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said tens of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were all destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found in a basement under collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage would rise sharply in the coastal strip 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala,
Communications have completely stopped and there is no news from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
This is another tragedy, but it could get worse, she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not announcing a tsunami that was going to hit Palu, although officials said tidal waves had come in between when the warning was issued.
A video shared on social media that is not official can be heard from the roof of a building shouting a tsunami warning to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water fell on the sea, washing away buildings and small cars.
Reuters news agency was unable to immediately verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and communications blackouts around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate coordinated rescue efforts.
Military aircraft have begun to send supplies and relief from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city's only airport has reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's death toll from tsunami rises to 800
The Situation Went Awry.
Although World Vision staff returned safely to Palu city from Donggala, where the staff lived in tanfol huts set up in the courtyard of their office, they showed a somewhat dismal attitude on the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said we saw many houses destroyed", he said.
The situation was very bad.
Despite the relief teams launching a major relief operation, some complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, spending, production and recruitment of foreign workers will only begin if a disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
It is still a flat disaster zone, said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, OK, this will be another national disaster, we will open for international assistance but there is no position yet.
As the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the victims were hoping that their loved ones would be a miracle to revive the sad stories of the national disaster.
On the Sabbath, a young child is pulled out of a garbage dump.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been lying in a ditch for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Ski Team, has been training the two missing athletes of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The rest of the victims at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
As a top athlete in downhill, I too feel a sense of urgency, he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, in the days following the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse that was broadcast among the downhill community, he sent WhatsApp messages in the background to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only produced one gray colored symbol, instead of another two of blue colored.
"I think he meant no texting", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during refilling of ATM in Newport on Dabue
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee refilling an ATM in Newport on Dabue, according to a report released by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of a minivan pulls out an ATM in an entertainment complex and plans to bring in extra cash, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was at work, a man came running from behind the Brink's employee and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene according to the announcement, but police did not specify how many were inside.
Anyone with information about their testimony should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper changes name - to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I would have been known as Kanye West.
Nicknamed Ye to West, the 41-year-old has also used the moniker for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show which was cancelled for "gross indecision", according to the show's creator.
As it became an abbreviation of his current occupational name, West once said the word had a religious meaning to him.
I believe ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means head", West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, we are you.
It has gone from Kanye, which means one, to the singular Yes - just another indicator of our beauty, our delusion, everything.
The disc is like a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known by various aliases such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that his preferred aliases were Love and Brother Love.
Another West collaborator, JAY-Z, also frequently performed with or without a short middle line of words and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student uprising.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza not to use the military to crush the Mexican people.
The troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration at the school on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when student activists were beginning to find shelter in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He also said that unemployment and a lack of proper education are the main factors that attract youngsters to criminal organizations.
The US should be corrupting A.I. money.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on field research, said AI investment engineer Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government have spoken out against artificial intelligence, despite the US having no artificial intelligence in custody.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the world's first artificial intelligence country by 2030.
"Breaking the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for something new in AI", Lee said.
Increasing spending could double the chances of achieving the next big AI in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures China, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI program that beat the more prestigious American actor Othello, and later became a vice president at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee cited past US government competitions on technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge where he asked when the next one would be, because it helped identify future predictors.
Analysts in the United States often work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
 China does not hire knowledge leaders; it is companies, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired top academics from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said the changes in the land-use policy could also help the US boost its AI efforts.
"I feel that green cards should be automatically issued to graduates in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
The National People's Congress of China released the Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence for its Future Generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for individuals in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding for U.S. researchers, but the value of academic work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the US Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an effort called AI Next.
In the case of the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, a bill in the United States seeking to create a National Intelligence Surveillance Agency has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, in a vote that would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its border and is in the process of contesting membership in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments gained a status in June on a new name they had decided upon, but nationalist opponents argued the change would reduce the ethnic identity of Macedonia's large Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and an exit campaign cast doubt on whether turnout would reach the 50% threshold required for a successful referendum.
The question on the referendum was: You are a NATO member and you are a member of the European Union and you agree to the agreement with Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a sacrifice to pursue accession to institutions such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia because they can live freely under the banner of the European Union because it means a safe life for us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it has no legal force, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it fair.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority of the legislature.
The national election commission said there were no reports of problems until 1 pm.
However, turnout stood at only 15 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our position is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, together with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, called their referendum vote in Macedonia on changing the country's name which would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia on September 3, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small demonstration and pulled up seats in front of tents set up by the referendum's opponents.
"We are members of NATO and the European Union, but we want to enter with dignity, not behind the door of action", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor nation, but we are perfect.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of a union of Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring a lot of investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that many will because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after his vote.
He said that one of the effects of eh would be to ensure our future.
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Resolution Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required exit.
A public opinion poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma television, found 57 percent of respondents were preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed the exit requirement was 50 percent plus one additional vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first setback to the resolve of Western-backed governments since it took hold in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero surrounds Brighton's defence completely to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling pushed Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed a humiliating performance on his own goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a push in midfield early in the game.
He ran through Brighton's defence, before cutting into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed around one guard before avoiding the others on the Brighton box side.
Then he threw another to his right, where he got Sterling.
The English striker used his first kick in the box to pass the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a small all-rounder into the right side of the net.
Aguero is struggling with some issues in his contract, according to a report by City manager Pep Guardiola.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We managed to win another win this time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance in the Premier League.
The meal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's backfield very well in this match.
He sent a beautiful inside ball through the left field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few trips before leading Sterling to the finish line.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball into the net just before it went out of bounds.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wanted to be a Rockies fan
With the Nationals out of the playoffs once again, there was no reason to force a fresh start.
But league fan Scherzer is hoping to take Sunday's series against the Colorado Rockies, but only if he has just enough playoff cards for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least had a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still looked to seal their first division berth.
Even though we're playing a little bit of nothing, at least we can play rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver is with the crowd and one team will play at probably the biggest flat of any big league I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday but reportedly wanted to let Scherzer escalate the situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th birthday, threw another major time on Thursday and will pitch on his same Sunday break.
Washington's uniform catcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallied in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned the context surrounding his nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the benefits of the Republican primary in the midterm elections.
Everything we did was stopped in November.
Five weeks from now is one of the most rewarding decisions of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big - I will not stand but actually I will stand for it that is why I am everywhere fighting for local candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this disaster, the disaster of the Democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to seize power at every opportunity, and you see the sad, unfairness.
They have no power and control over anyone they offend, they will be destroyed, so they want power and control, not from us.
The Democrats, he said, are on an anti-barriers policy.
"And you see that in the last four days", he said, "he has been calling the Democrats angry and sad and cruel and dishonest".
He named the top member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who was cheered on by the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you open the paper?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I was waiting for one - that's the worst sign of dishonesty - the worst sign of dishonesty I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a big church.
Another is impatience of those who express their feelings
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to stop me, it was no surprise.
Since I was the newest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we were not welcome - all because of the strife in our hearts.
My fellow congresswoman Joan Ryan was humiliated for taking a stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the ban was cancelled because of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the benefits of a sound economic policy, on national security, on Europe, unfortunately the same issues that Jeremy has been at odds with previous presidents.
A statement for the Nottingham East Labour Conference on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and meaningful".
For most of those eight years as a Labour member of parliament, the same was true on the nights of GC meetings.
Unfortunately today, it is no longer the feature of many conferences and the political promise of ihsani, wisdom has been forgotten if, indeed, ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any views are judged on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became president, because my former political colleagues began to expect me to make a revolution and take a position I would never agree with - either on national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every day I speak in public - and I don't really say anything - only the social media smears are calling for re-election, ignoring centrist politics, telling us that I should not be a Labour Party member.
And that was not all I saw.
In fact, I knew that I was more successful than many of my colleagues because the orders given to me were often political.
I am a teammate of the experience and determination of these colleagues who face some form of racial discrimination every day but never run away.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is the rampant slander.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
What is really happening is that we are now giving that big house no issue of "not accepting the ability" or changing the electoral laws as the party is getting smaller.
I have had many calls in the last two years that I was quiet, quiet and I would be no problem.
But I did not want to be involved in politics.
Having joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, inspired by the Thatcher government's policy of leaving entire classrooms in ruins, I thought I was a champion of social reform for those most in need - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham can be said to be confused about my position and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who were promoting Friday's issue, all I can say is that at a time when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and government services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in fact the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve the public and I pledge that no threat of re-election or political hypocrisy will stop me from working in what I believe is the best interests of the public at large.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr undefeated in the heats
Two late tests missed the final result of the series, but Ayr was undoubtedly right to win in this spectacular performance of Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated tenth.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their excellent defensive skills, that took the house by storm and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be proud.
We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: Thankfully for Ayr, they took their concerns more seriously than we did.
A 14-minute test of Anderson's contribution, replaced by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, however, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to score against Jason Baggot.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with another penalty, before, at half-time, he lost it and traded a solo test to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half perfectly and Patrick Anderson tried, replaced by Baggot, to reduce the passing margin to five points.
There was a long delay during the race due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken on late, and the restart, Ayr pushed forward the top runner through a test by Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
Then the vice-captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose made the man pay for an unchanged Bruce Colvine test, eventually a brutal pressure attack.
The home side recovered, however, and when a yellow card was given to Struan Hutchinson for approaching Climo without a ball, from the penalty area, MacPherson hit the ground from behind the approaching Ayr outfield.
Climo changed course, as he did again at least from the start, after Kyle Rowe collected a box hit from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry another out for a fifth home run.
Game star still ready for new job in food industry
Game star Ford Kieran has yet to show signs of being ready to enter the grooming industry after it was revealed he was offered the position of director of a licensed grocery store.
The 56-year-old is appearing in Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with fellow comedian Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming series of nine episodes would be the last in the series' run, and it appeared Kiernan was preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to the company's written records, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to say anything about the story, although a Scottish Sun newspaper has rumored that Kiernan was trying to get into Glasgow's fast food chain.
The ocean is ours: Bolivia's landlocked country hopes court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval base in La Paz.
The blue flag was hoisted over the government buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon with the motto: The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to return it.
In the entirety of Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of losing a coastal area to Chile a devastating resource crisis of the 19th century is still evident - because it was because of their need to navigate again the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
These differences are perhaps the greatest in years, as Bolivia awaits a minor ruling from the international court on October 1 after five years of litigation.
"Bolivia has a dynamic, united and peaceful atmosphere, and it certainly expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on major TV channels across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will reach a unanimous decision on Bolivia's request - after years of unsuccessful negotiations - Chile agreed to a deal where it gave Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's popular indigenous president - who faces a fractious re-election campaign next year - has a lot of chances of being cleared of Monday's ruling.
We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean, at a highlight in late August.
But some pirates believe that it will be difficult to make a decision that is in Bolivia's best interests - and that nothing will change if it does.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to define Chile's border, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
That the International Court's ruling comes only six months after the final hearing of the case shows that the case is not a disaster, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not even close to the help of the Bolivian law, the last four years have probably led her backwards.
The Bolivian government has now taken over the issue of access to the sea, Zárate said.
Morales's unpopularity ended any sympathy for Chile, in her opinion.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have a conversation after that.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the argument that the court's decision-making process was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an unprecedented opportunity to open a new page of relations with Chile and an opportunity to bring an end to 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular leaders - has used the issue of the sea as a political argument.
He added that "Bolivia will never give up the right to touch access to the Pacific Ocean".
 The sentence is an opportunity to see that what happened afterwards is forgotten.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never abandon its nuclear weapons from the start unless it could trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the commitments made at a summit in Singapore between future presidents.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was about to resume the diplomatic push on nuclear more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was just another "dream" to continue the US sanctions and hate for any statement that ending the Korean War would ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is hesitant to accept the statement without Pyongyang first taking a significant step towards reducing its weapons.
Kim and US President Donald Trump generally want a second summit.
But there is widespread disagreement that Pyongyang is not committed enough to the elimination of a weapon that the country considers to be almost its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show has released the latest line in your wardrobe on its way to a Grand Avenue near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat or block the sun completely, then do not go any further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased their large and elegant headwear collection for their SS19 line on the runway that decorated the fashion show at Paris Fashion Week.
Unimaginable hats have flooded Instagram this weekend and these designers have poured their creative eye into the bottom of the fashion show.
Valentino's gift was a top hat worn with a hairline that covered the heads of the models.
Other important supports include a fancy headband, a helmet, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also has a unique collection of masks - and only for the Halloween season.
Many of the colorful masks had lip seams and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture style.
One of the shells was shaped like a scuba diver's snorkel and tubes, and the other was shaped like a tube of melted milk ice.
And if you keep the details of the jewelry - you're a winner.
Fashion observers predict that the big bonnets may start to hit the main streets near you.
The big hats come well on top of the 'La Bomba' high heels, a scraped hat with two short wings seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cap's popularity has been widely circulated on social media sending a huge creative spin to the fashion show floor - to a beach suitcase almost as big as a swimsuit prototype.
The orange bag, decorated with a white leather raffia top-sided pattern, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I think seeing big hats and beach bags coming on the highway for the next winter - because because the designer has made such a big impact it would be hard to ignore the need for big supports.
John Edward: Essential linguistic knowledge for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a subset of test scores that excelled, only encouraged by individual achievement and participation in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With an additional 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, run by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, are working to provide a better working environment for young children and their parents.
Private schools have the mission of preparing their children for higher education, the lifestyle they have chosen for themselves as global citizens.
As a branch of learning that can shape and implement the spoken school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming increasingly popular and the preferred subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
When you speak to him in his language, it touches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English to build friendly relations with people from other nations.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest scores in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received an A or better.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed that 72 percent of the students scored an A in Mandarin, followed by 72 percent of those who read German, 69 percent of those who read French and 63 percent of those who read Spanish.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are held in the same place as STEM (science, engineering and mathematics) courses in private school curricula and some elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey found that the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
So a vast array of language skills is once again essential to prepare youths for future life.
With the increasing job opportunities available to those who need languages, these skills are essential in a fast-paced world.
Regardless of what career a person chooses in life, if they learn a second language, they will have a wise long-term future benefit such as:
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from foreign countries would immediately put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to communicate and French was the only spoken language and the percentage of a two-digit place in a numeric value, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language education now is beneficial for children tomorrow.
Having multiple languages, especially those of the developing economies, will give children a good chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
Most schools will focus on more advanced modern languages, but the rest will teach languages considered most relevant for England in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your children's interests are, there will always be other languages to choose from in private schools, with teachers who are experts in the area.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that prepares underprivileged children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to play a beneficial role for the future of the country, so this must be incorporated into knowledge.
Of course, modern languages should literally be considered "international communication systems".
Private schools will continue to provide this option, living together and outdoors for young people in Scotland.
We have to do well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make the Lakers appear Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he just doesn't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
"It's going to be more than one and close to 48", Walton said on the Lakers' website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter that James may have a setback in the minutes.
After a trial earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need my games early at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump meetings in the coming week that included stops at friendly locations in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of his nomination for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress by the time the November vote.
When is Trump's West Virginia night meeting and how can I watch it online?
Trump's meeting is scheduled for Wheeling, West Virginia at 7pm on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below when it's happening on YouTube.
Trump unsurprisingly spoke out on the issue this week for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, who has been harsh on allegations of sexual harassment and is expected to stay a Senate vote for another week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the forum is to help the Republicans who face the November elections gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said the purpose of the five meetings next week was to "inspired candidates and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will be visiting multiple states as we enter the offseason", said a Trump campaign spokesman who told Reuters but declined to be identified.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight will bring fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring the media to Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump was trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who was running behind in the election.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that until the president comes to try to increase his popularity in the election, "" said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show up to fight to build the hopes of a competitive individual on Sunday
After the one-sided moments, Saturday's four-on-four matchup might just be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The change in the mood of a young man is a game in itself but one in which the athletes truly believe, and never before has it been so, even in competitions like these.
So where do they say the flock is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so we consider that a step up in my opinion", Jordan Spieth said in his final for the day.
Europe had the advantage, in fact, of four points ahead with twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little bit of help in the situation although they have a lot to encourage them, at least not the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got up three points out of four.
Spieth was a poison from tee to green and led by example.
The party noise was heard as his circle continued, drowning a vital item to take up four squares while he and Thomas were being killed two at a time.
His attempt to beat them on the 15th day of the match, which he met with such a screeching, shows you that he believes that the American team is not excluded from this.
"You have to really get in there and really focus on your game", Spieth said.
All of these players are gone now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in over two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unlikely Ryder Club legend.
Four out of four European couples who are similar but desirable would not make a mistake.
Moliwood became the only duo not to shoot a projectile on Saturday afternoon but also avoided the projectile on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and after nine on Friday morning.
That was over, and their energy was completely diverted from the attendance and the publicity that they had been asserting that they were the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more player to cover a possible European victory as the sun rose over Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
If desired all at the same time in different holes.
The prospect of European glory is still looming.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball champion, during their two-way tie with Alex Noren.
A bogey and double-crash on the front of the boat drove the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to exiting.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four spheres and the four links are interesting at least from a close-up view because of the interaction between the two links, the suggestions they make, the disadvantages and the way in which one strategy can be transformed into another.
Europe have played well as a team so far and were leaders on the final day but this time the fourth-place finish also shows that Team USA is in for a fight that, especially Stateside, they have been hesitant about.
Europe leads 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a useful advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after rising from Saturday's four-point lead and four-game lead with another 10-6 lead in the United States.
The two boldly-picked Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the change and won two victories over Tiger Woods struggling to take his record-breaking number one at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, the defending champion, had not won at Hazeltine two years earlier, having overcome a dismal run of luck in the American side in the four-match morning, taking a 3-1 series lead.
The United States added a push in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they were unable to score in the final.
The Jim Furyk department needed points from 12 individual games on Sunday to hold the cup.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four tries while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a weekend in which they were spoken of and were the only pair to score four tries from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth round they then went on to beat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by another 5-4 margin.
Woods, who pulled himself into two games on Saturday, showed an academic display but now has lost 19 of his games by four goals and four-for-4 and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's four-goal, returned to teammate Henrik Stenson in a four-for-4 game to beat a 2 for 1 score of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - a world-class one for three.
Europe did not find it so easy, a windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new American record with two points on Saturday.
They had a disappointing 2 and 1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm Ian Poulter in four sets and a comeback later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the quarter-finals after losing the match by opening two holes.
It was only once in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team came back from a four-point loss in the singles, though as the Furyk Division holders needed only a horse's stance to hold the cup.
After being the second-best for two days, however, another attack on Sunday seemed to overwhelm them.
North Korea says it can't reduce its weapons alone without loyalty
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are further pushing its disapproval of the United States and that there is no way the country will leave its nuclear arsenal alone under any circumstances.
Ri Yong told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying a nuclear test site, and pledging not to expand its nuclear weapons and technology.
"But, we have not seen any response from the United States", he said.
Without any American loyalty there will be no confidence in our national security and under the circumstances there is no way we alone will reduce our weapons in the first place.
In the face of repeated complaints from South Korea that Washington is refusing to pursue a "gradual" nuclear arms reduction program under which North Korea would be given a free hand in the event of a gradual reduction, Rike's speech was significant because it did not simply deny its nuclear weapons reduction as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri was looking at a joint speech from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a high-level summit between the US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's defense.
North Korea is seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The US has been committed to nuclear deterrence from the beginning and has increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even rejected the "war-ending" declaration, Ri said.
Awareness that restrictions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued restrictions only increase our disapproval.
Ri did not comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US president had made at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: If the country involved in this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of Korea would not have had such a problem.
However, Ri's speech was slightly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US presence in the Korean peninsula was something he had to play through after the "Mr. President" Trump called Kim a "suicide rocket man".
At this year's UN, Trump, who last year had threatened Russia with a full-scale invasion of North Korea, praised Kim for his strong stance on arms reduction, but said there was still work to be done and sanctions were in place until North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The Security Council sanctions must be enforced to continue without fail until we see the complete and ultimately verified elimination of nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has generally imposed strict sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly where he said he would then visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times since the beginning of the year, but his visit was not very pleasant.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming progress had been made, only to be overruled by North Korea in a few days to demand a "sectarian" status.
North Korea has agreed at some point with Moon this month to demolish a missile test site and a nuclear facility if the US takes further steps in the direction.
He said Kim told him of "some of the steps in the process" he was seeking were the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all its students with more sleep in a bid to break the big study craze by drinking coffee all night.
A professor found that students at one university in the world generally know nothing about basic self-sufficiency.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive learning.
Finally one girl came to me and said: Why are we only told this now, in my last year?
She said no one had ever told her about the benefits of sleep - something that surprised her, she told The Telegraph.
The course began its first session this year, where students were taught the benefits of good sleep habits for academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were severely deprived of sleep during the week.
The one hour-long session included a series of other discussion activities.
In one section there is a chapter of a dormitory, where students press coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them about the effects of light and noise and how the practice of jumping affects sleep deprivation, and the benefits of a bedtime ritual.
In one section, the campers were told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A school map, with interactive signs, then encourages the participants to think about what they are doing each day.
We know it will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke", adds Professor Czeisler.
The tradition of "sleeping all night" is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is becoming a major problem.
Ensuring that a student gets enough, a good night's sleep should be a "secret weapon" to combat depression, fatigue, and anxiety - or to avoid becoming overweight, for sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, leaving them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemist and biochemist, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking one of the previous year's classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says that the course opened his eyes and attracted him to apply for the course throughout the school.
Looking forward to the next step, he would ask all students of the postgraduate studies department to complete a course of study before entering a competitive school.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should be careful to set an alarm clock for when to go to bed, and even when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put your health system into a sleep-wake mode, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 vs Rangers 0: Menga defeat humiliates Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered a setback when Dolly Menga's attack narrowed Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 lead at Livingston.
Ibrox side were looking to produce their first home run on the road since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side drew to beat Gerrard for only the second time in 18 games as manager leaving his side with eight points down the stretch on Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga attacked seven minutes into the half and a Rangers short-line shot on the attraction never looked flat.
While Rangers now dropped down to sixth place, Livingston moved up to third and just behind Hibernian on points difference.
And there could be more violence in the reserves for Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a knee injury after apparently being thrown from the end zone.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that sent Ayr into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the 11th-seeded Levi who had removed the stain from Hearts the week before and was pleased with how his teammates had harmed their opponents in each edition.
Rangers were probably in control of the ball but Livingston did a lot with the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes into the first leg when Menga's first substitution sent Scott Pittman through to beat Allan McGregor but the midfielder extended his big chance considerably.
An unblocked goal by Keaghan Jacobs then got Craig Halkett but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only extend behind the post.
Rangers were in control but there was a sign of more hope than agreement about their game in the last three.
Alfredo Morelos obviously felt he should have been asked to score a goal in the third quarter as he faced Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian complaints.
Rangers attempted only a first half second-half hit on the attack but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly showed no signs of slowing down from Lassana Coulibaly's head kick and a quick drive by Ovie Ejaria.
While Levi's 34-minute opening goal may have been a replay, no one could deny that they deserved it for their only score.
The Rangers again failed to tackle another Jacobs attack.
Scott Arfield did not respond where Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who was cold to Menga's take of a small finish.
Gerrard worked in the break where he replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent and the changeover almost made an immediate impact as the corner-half attacker of Morelos's goal-kicking but impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block.
But Livingston continued to beat the visitors to the real game they were enjoying, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball up the back of the long ball.
Holt's side extended their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood firmly to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow hit a hole-in-one.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton scored a late penalty in a late attempt against Jacobs but Thomson was ruled out.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and it is also THE DAY OF THE COUNTRY... the date the future geologist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger built a system to detect and measure the steam activity, a discovery that led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A scientific reference since then, the Geiger Counter has become a reference in the popular culture of the time, where in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", the invisible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appeared in the stars:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It was a Geiger Counter, used to detect minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually feel the chemical reactions of the atomic vapor produced in the raw materials.
Evans: "You say, 'It's definitely coming out now!'"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the myth that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to identify  problem cells
A new cancer vaccine may train the immune system to "detect" and kill malignant cells
The injection trains the immune system to recognize problem cells as part of treatment
The procedures include extracting immune cells from a patient and placing them in a scientific laboratory
They can then identify a nutrient that most cancer patients know and then re-insert it
A trial shot has shown positive results in patients in a certain stage of cancer.
One woman who received treatment with the injection, which teaches the immune system to detect defective cells, saw her uterine cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from a patient, where they are modified in a scientific laboratory to detect a protein known to many cancers as HER2, and then reinserted into the cells.
"Our results suggest that a vaccine may be a good fit", says Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American Cancer Society in Bethesda, Maryland.
According to Professor Berzofsky, HERS "stimulates the growth of many types of cancer", including breast, uterus, lungs, and spleen.
A similar technique that takes cells from diseased patients and "trains" them to attack cancer cells has been used in the treatment of malaria.
Kanye West Begins to insult Trump Haters, Wearing a MAN HUD, After His SNL Appearance
It Is Not Fair
Kanye West was booed in the broadcast studio during Saturday Night Live after a roar in which he praised the President of the United States.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great hat, he passed out making a roar at Democrats and reiterating his support for Trump.
"On several occasions I spoke to a white man and they said: "How can you like Trump, he is a racist?"
If I had worried about racial discrimination I would have left America already", he said.
SNL premiered the show with a Matt Damon-esque comedy where the Hollywood star gave a humorous review of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual harassment complaints by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, a short video of West's roar was uploaded on social media by Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock was trying to discredit West with his material.
Similarly, West complained to the audience that he had suffered backstage about his own situation.
"They were harassing me behind the scenes.
'Don't go out there with your helmet on,' they said.
They were cruel!
And they called me a green man", he said as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see a green space? " he said "I'll wear my big man hat, because it means you can't tell us what to do.
Try to make love".
His comments drew at least two rounds of screaming from the audience and members of the SNL cast expressed embarrassment, according to Variety reports, with one person there saying to the press: "The studio was completely silent".
West was brought in as a replacement for the late singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by singing a song called I Love It, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the president of the conservative group TRUSA, Candace Turner who said on Twitter: "To one of the brave ones: WE THANK YOU for STANDING UP FOR YOUR PRIORITY AND YOUR PRIORITY".
But hostess Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West is simply "expressing who he is and that's really cool".
"But I choose not to give gifts to anyone (by buying his music or products or by showing support for his "wisdom") who I believe is spreading and promoting ideas that are harmful to my community.
He has free will.
She adds, "Yes, we are".
Prior to the show, the rapper announced via Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "someone I used to be known as Kanye West".
He was not the first singer to change his name and follow in their footsteps Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His brother rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lion and then the famous singer Prince, having changed his name to a trademark and musician formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder with a knife in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a pub in east Belfast on Friday.

The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The State Prosecutor's Office will renew the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes the idea of showing off youth
Kit Harington is best known for his portrayal of sword-turning Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the filmmaker, 31, criticized the male heroism, saying that such models imply that young children often feel that they have to be a failure before they can be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of male dominance in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that she feels "very strongly" about dealing with the issue.
I feel in my body, very strong, at this moment - what have we done wrong with the giant's head?'
What are we teaching the men as they grow up, given the problems we see today?'
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise of this superhero concept because of the superhero male athletes being released.

I feel that this is one of the great questions of our time - how can we change this?
Because something is clearly wrong with the boys.'
In an interview he also confirmed that he would no longer be making Game of Thrones when the series ended in the next season, saying he had 'closed the battlefields with horses'.
From November Kit will appear in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West which is a story about a film producer and his brother, who is an armed robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered his reunion with his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in this program, so in this way he gave me my future family, and life will start from there,' he said.
Rose appeared in Ygritte, Kit's romantic comedy adaptation of Jon Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning film.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the backyard of their Leslie family home in Scotland.
Tuberculosis/Deficient immune system: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported a jump of 14 percent of its population living with measles and other autoimmune diseases.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been infected, health officials said.
Almost 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new infections are sexually transmitted, which is a far cry from what it used to be.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through the transfusion of infected blood.
But the number of new HIV infections through this method has dropped to almost zero, according to health officials at a health fair in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and other immune-deficiency disorders in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a major issue in China's gay and lesbian community.
The ban on homosexuality was lifted in China in 1997, but discrimination against gays and lesbians is said to have grown.
Because of the country's tradition of homosexuality, surveys estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have had homosexual relations will eventually marry.
Most of the transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to achieve international access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies leaking allegations that her employee leaked GOP senators' records, angrily calling it 'terrible lies' and 'hypocritical matters'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed rumors that a member of her staff leaked the privacy information of three Republican U.S. senators on members' pages in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that the myth was spread by "social media" and "social media" "conspiracies".
Lies, lies, and more lies, Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information is said to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The statement was made online on Thursday, by an unnamed person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on the alleged sexual assault of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came a few days after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the exported footprint was associated with the Waters office" that released the information of a member of the Waters staff, Hill reports.
This baseless myth is a complete lie and a complete lie, Waters continued.
The members of my staff - whose credentials, identity, and privacy have been destroyed as a result of these scams and fabrications - are not responsible for the leak.
This unfounded myth is a complete lie and a complete hoax".
Waters' speech drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This rejection was outrageous, wrote Fleischer.
This shows that she was not qualified to be a Member of Parliament.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be offended.
They do not have to be determined.
They do not have to question the motives of the accused.
They have to calm down and breathe".
Fleischer was coming out to compare Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too forward during Thursday's debate.
Omar Navarro, a candidate seeking to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It would be terrible if it were true", he tweeted.
In her speech, Waters said her office had alerted her to "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent complaints.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified, she continued, "and will be held accountable for all their destructive and harmful actions against anyone and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Re-commented - Rowan Atkinson the most powerful spy
It is now common to see the effects of Brexit in every film with a British actor and that doesn't mean it will run to this revival of the Johnny English comedy - which debuted back in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back live in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a mockery of the fact that we are the new country with the right to import?
In any case, the eye was drawn to the plastic face of Johnny English who was unable to get his license to design new features for a second season - his name implies more than anything that he was a broad-based invention designed for movie-goers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is a real spy despite the fact that his style of dress-up is so elegant that Clouseau's son, a Mr. Bean employee and a work by the same man contributed as one piece to the theme song for Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
And he is also the original subject of the traveler and international superhero Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving a violent impression in his wake.
There are one or two good situations in this latest JE release.
I loved the way Johnny English approached a helicopter while wearing a suit of vintage armor and with rotor blades attached to the top of his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is often shown in public, but the humor seems to be weak and shady, especially when considering the popular "no-holds barred" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are now boldly producing comedy as their own flavor.
The humor felt as if it was aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the horror Johnny English saw was not fictional and was an Atkinson experience in the character of Bean.
The common argument was that Great Britain was in a state of great turmoil.
A hacker hacked into the British intelligence network, exposing the identity of all British agents in the sector, embarrassing the working agent - a slightly embarrassing development for Kevin Eldon's small business.
It was the final straw for a self-absorbed and rebellious prime minister, already suffering a meltdown of political animosity: Emma Thompson did the best she could with this uncharacteristically Teresa May attitude but nothing much in the way of a performance.
Her secret advisers told her that almost every spy had been destroyed, she had to bring one of the retired.
And that means Johnny English himself, now working as a schoolteacher in a good institution, but leaving lessons in how to become a spy: some good gags here, as English provides a spy reading of some sort.
English was dragged back to Whitehall for an urgent briefing and reunited with his former aide alongside Bough, made over to Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, involved with a ship's captain, a sort of playful role where Vicki Pepperdine becomes a bit of a waste of time.
So Batman and Robin make a nasty mistake against the Queen's Secret Service and go back to work, meeting the beautiful troubled woman Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is facing a dangerous failure under the control of a coveted tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer disaster: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began to test their systems: disguised as waiters, they lit a fire at a French restaurant light; they created a noise where they were drowning in the comfort of Volta's boat; and English instigated a lawlessness where he tried to use a Virtual Reality headset to understand himself and Volta's house.
Of course all the stand-ups were pulled for the final series, but despite its beauty and size, there was a children's television special about the whole thing.
A moderate measure of good order.
And with all the other Johnny English films I can't help but wonder: why wouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would actually do justice to his intelligence?
Labour refuses to agree to a plan for British workers to work four days a week but be paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a major plan that would see Britons work four days a week - but get paid five days.
According to reports the party wants the company's executives to hand over the money saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the employees by giving them an extra day off.
He would see the workers enjoying a three-day weekend - but still getting the same pay.
The media claimed that the wisdom would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a working-class democracy.
A move to a four-day week won the approval of the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from a transformed economy.
A leading Labour Party spokesperson told The Sunday Times: "A review of the resolution is expected to be announced before the end of the year".
It would not happen in one day but a four-day workweek was a fitting attraction in the party's approach to economic restructuring for the worker and even the party's overall strategy to face the factory.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to adopt such a concept, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party is now showing less overall confidence and attraction, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not a party resolution and the party has also considered it.'
The junior chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to show what he sees as a revolution of socialist ideology in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was ready to seize power from "secret directors" and "profiteers" in public utility companies.
The small-scale schemes also mean that current investors in water companies may not get a full return on their investment because a Labour government may 'cut' on what is seen as unfair grounds.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the board of a company and create Private Equity Funds to give 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who can earn annual dividends of up to around 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of the fictional Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nominee by at least a week, and raised questions about whether the agency's findings will draw any Republican senators to their side.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy described him as more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
I mean, of course, the Kennedy machine.
"I said I would go into the hearing, I said, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that you appeared, and I said, 'Did you send it?'
It was firm, ready, and unshakable".
Graham's election, however, seemed to be a foregone conclusion.
"My heart is set on Brett Kavanaugh and he will take another serious charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied it completely", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every one who has mentioned it has been unable to identify it.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing".
What Is World Food Day, and Has It Helped Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Poetry Festival, an annual music festival that has a major impact that will draw stars to another exciting mission; to end poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Day will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the festival to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Day Against Poverty, first observed in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Campaign to End Poverty, an international movement that hopes to end poverty by combating the growing number of people who are struggling to cope with it.
To receive a free ticket to the service (unless you are willing to pay for a ticket for a big crowd), concert-goers must complete a series of tasks, or "tasks", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how did the League of Nations succeed in the 12 years that remained before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free music forum a good way to entice people to ask for a call to action, or is it just another form of the "clicktivism" idea - people feel like they're really making a difference by signing online petitions or posting a Twitter post?
Since 2011, the World Citizens League said it has collected more than 19 million "projects" from its supporters, promoting various goals.
He said that these efforts have helped to persuade world leaders to announce pledges and resolutions worth an estimated $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people worldwide by 2030.
In early 2018, the group brought 390 commitments and announcements that came from its operations, with at least $10 billion already spent or raised.
The group estimates that the economic impact of the increase was directly felt by some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most notable donations include the Nutrition Force, a UK-based coalition of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", and a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of UK government donors, donors, national governments, and just like you, Global Citizens, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historic event, Nutrition Strength Ambassador Tracey Ullman told a public forum during an instantaneous concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking over 5,000 actions calling on England to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for another initiative, Nutrition Strengthening, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition supports.
In response to one of the questions asked on her website she asks "why do we think we can end extreme poverty?"
The world's citizens respond: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall.
But like the great civil liberties and anti-apartheid struggles that have preceded us, we will win, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will perform at this year's festival in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US will use navy to "block" to prevent the release of missing goods - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, according to US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke hypothesizes that Russia's intervention in Syria - that is, where it is said to be acting at the invitation of a recognized government - is a prelude to the search for new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to have the same energy as they did in eastern Europe, southern central Europe", he was quoted as saying.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure open sea lanes, and, if it does, to blockade it, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing a conference organized by the Energy Consumers' Party, a nonprofit group that is considered the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia's relations with Iran, since they were similar.
"The economic area against Iran and Russia is, to a greater or lesser extent, the benefit of oil substitution", he said, while referring to Russia as a "coin pile" with an economy based on fossil fuel wheels.
The comments came as the Trump administration has since begun working on a policy to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw the "irregular" Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscows a "prisoner".
Moscow further stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline, which is set to double the current development pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a genuine economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's main opposition to the project was economically motivated and was an example of a misguided game.
"I think we have the view that energy will not be a one-size-fits-all tool that consumers choose their suppliers for", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US move drew a response from Germany, which confirmed the launch of the project.
The German industrialist group, the Confederation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States to suspend EU energy policy and the Berlin-Moscow cooperation agreement.
"I have a serious problem when the third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will make "good research" for the 2020 Presidential nomination, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would make a "very thorough assessment" of her presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During the city council election in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that includes the women above", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will take a closer look at running for president.
Warren denounced President Donald Trump at the city council, saying he was running the country improperly.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has long been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We really need an FBI investigation before the election".
A polling result released on Thursday, however, showed that most Warren voters do not think she will run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts residents said the congresswoman should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Institute/Boston Global Poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The results showed the strongest support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38 percent in favor of the candidate and 48 percent against.
Some of the top Democratic Party members discussed for the 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Congressman Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin launches PTSD track Palin at the Donald Trump summit
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is recovering from, I can relate to other families who feel the burden of PTSD and some of the injuries of military repatriation", she told the crowd at the Donald Trump summit in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other soldiers, "they come back in a different situation, they come back with a different attitude, they come back with the same attitude if there is the same respect that their fellow soldiers, both in the air and in the air, and any other security force give to their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a domestic violence investigation and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, Wasilla Police Department Deputy.
18 states, D.C. supporting the challenge of new asylum system
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to the new US policy banning asylum for gang and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a companion brief on Friday, in Washington, in support of the asylum seeker's challenge to the system, NBC reported.
full name of Plaintiff in Grace v. Unresolved class action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal government.
She said her union partner and child molester had insulted her but US officials had denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace likened El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many asylum seekers in the United States, to states with high crime rates and domestic concern.
The new asylum system overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that allowed undocumented domestic violence refugees to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "does not address decades of previous federal, state, and international law".
"Federal law requires that any asylum claim be decided on the basis of the facts, and such a rope breaks this principle", said the council's co-counsel.
Officials have repeatedly stressed that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the US economy is harmful, saying they can become entrepreneurs and "create decent jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration authorities to no longer grant asylum to victims of serious domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their home country due to persecution or fear due to ethnicity, religion, origin, or representation in a particular group or political opinion", Sessions said in the June 11 policy announcement.
Refugees will not solve all the problems - or even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Emergency rescue efforts in Palu as deaths increase in the search for survivors
For the living, the situation is worse.
"It's very violent", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her baby in a shelter in Palu.
 Every minute an ambulance brings in a body.
Here is the trouble of clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, pulling the goods out of the water, trying to evaluate everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, which overflowed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting in the back of Palus Army Hospital, where outpatients were being treated due to the severity of the incident.
Tears filled his eyes as he recalled the tremor that shook the fifth floor of the hotel room where he lived with his wife and daughter.
We do not have time to run away.
I was crushed against the wall, I thought, "Haris told the Press Club, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I think they are healthy.
US ambassador accuses China of 'abusing' with 'advertising propaganda'
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran four pages a day of criticism of US-China trade relations, however, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday indicated that China was paying daily subscriptions to the Des Moines daily - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusations that China was trying to interfere in the November 6 presidential election, allegations that China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election suggests that US officials told Reuters that it was a new US-Washington strategy to pressure China.
It is normal for foreign governments to introduce sales to promote trade, with Beijing and Washington locked in a trade war that has led them to the levels of the revenue graph on each.
China's initial response to tariffs in the trade war was to launch a factory that would break states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, China and the US.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural equipment to China, said Beijing harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece on Sunday in the Des Moines Register, "is now reducing this abuse by using propaganda ads in free newspapers".
"In the propaganda media, the Chinese government is contributing to the creation of an American culture of free speech and freedom of the press by paying for ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said.
He added, "In a library in Beijing, you will find no noise of voices that can prevent understanding the different views that Chinese society faces of economic problems, because the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans split women voters in front of Kavanaugh Debacle, observers warn
Many senior Republicans have stood up and defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as he faces allegations of sexual harassment, with observers warning that he will see interference, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The mood around this was high, and many Republicans were in the process of showing their interest in continuing the vote.
These things can't be undone", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake of (R-Arizona) in the final push of the FBI investigation could lead to voter anger.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the Women's Movement Movement on Friday, according to The Washington DC Times.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee voted to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic's lead spokeswoman.
"The passion for democracy and encouragement will go through the message", Stu Rothenberg, a political reporter, told the news website.
"People say he has been to heaven before, and that is true.
But it may be higher, especially among women's voting groups, in rural areas and in the mainstream of voters, 18 to 29 year olds, who don't like the president, won't vote".
Even before Ford's testimony made public her allegation of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court nominee, commentators had indicated support that could follow if the Republican candidate went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has been a major turmoil for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican State Central Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election committee or the final election or whether Kavanaugh was put on the bench, but about how the Republicans handled this and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of American Priorities, a support group for Democratic candidates, was quoted as saying by the media.
However, Americans were divided on who to believe after the appearance of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, with a small majority holding sway for a while.
A recent YouGov poll showed 41 percent of respondents were skeptical or likely to believe Ford's truth, while 35 percent were certain or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent agreed with Ford.
After being fired from Flake, the FBI is investigating the case that Ford filed with a single suspect, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford appeared before the House Judiciary Committee and swore last week that Kavanaugh was drunk when he raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez alleged that the former judge-elect showed her his genitals while attending a party while they were both students at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the world wide web is planning to launch a new website on the platform of google and facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is about to launch a project that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology is developed by Inrupt, a company that builds the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Mining allows users to choose where to store information and what access to information is allowed.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world empire".
"We don't have to do it now", he said of the beginning.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online repositories" or PODs.
It contains a list of contacts, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library and other personal tools and equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on the same browser all at the same time.
The amazing thing about the self-storage space in an online store is that the user has full access to such information.
The company calls it "an empirical confirmation of the data collected".
Inrupt's vision, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring the resources, processes and capabilities to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security software company acquired by IBM, several staff developers working on the project, and his team of coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own customized app using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee explained that he and his partners did not discuss "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a change where all their business models will go away overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission".
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's" goal is to "provide business and event energy to help protect the integrity and efficiency of building the new Solid Web site".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet again when he founded the World Wide Web Forum at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Within a few months, Berners-Lee was a leading voice in the non-alignment debate.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee would remain the co-founder and co-director of the Web Foundation, a nonprofit Web Foundation and Open Data Center.
I am optimistic about this modern transformation of the internet, berners-lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 teacher awarded Victoria cross
One Church of England parish priest has won the Victoria Cross during World War One and a devout Catholic celebrates his 100th birthday in his hometown.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had won the highest award of the British army.
A memorial plaque erected by his two grandchildren was unveiled at a fence in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a very special symbol" that the 100-year-old stone would be revealed as a gift to his grandfather.
According to the London Archives, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very rough and very dark fog to fire from the field from machine guns".
He then climbed up to the firing line with his "greatest warrior" who led the front line before he came out with a shotgun alone and knocked out three battalions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never be but something humble".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also wore scarves after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "I was very happy to be able to dance in the arena" and added that he was a great hero who was supported and helped by people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but then they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, for example, that you sit through the night watching Bellator 206 and then are blocked from seeing the actual event.
The list from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six on the main card and was shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the mood changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel less anxious after a long night's sleep, especially in the early morning hours.
One fan commented on Twitter that the change to children's cartoons is like a "disabled game".
"It is government policy that at 6 a.m. the channel is changed because the program is not appropriate and so they have to switch to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, vice president of communications and marketing, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa aleden", yeah".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will be working on plans to connect with UK viewers in the future.
"I think if I thought about reprinting, I think it might be profitable", Coker said.
"But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning there, and we could not do it until our time on Sunday, Monday.
but we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was replaced there were messages going back and forth and all of them were unpleasant.
We tried to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But that is not the case.
I promise you that will never happen again.

Discs Island Desert: Tom Daley feels 'up' because of gender
Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he grew up feeling superior to everyone else because of his race - but that's what gave him the talent to succeed.
A 24-year-old man admits that he did not realize until he entered high school that "everyone else was like me".
Speaking on the first ever Radio 4 Desert Island talk show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of illness.
While appearing as a different character on Laverne's first episode, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else growing up because "it's not acceptable for people to not like boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "my feelings of inferiority, and my feelings of something else, are the very things that give me strength and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they discovered his gender.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a major LGBT athlete and used it at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to try to increase the number of countries that would allow gay rights.
He said that he spoke because he enjoyed being in the audience without interruption and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with American boxer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise to him".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years his senior, last year but said the age gap didn't matter.
"When you have to go through so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it is hard to find a man who has ever achieved such a high status.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all the expectations of his future" changed.
"If you ask me last year, all I was talking about was winning the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not believe he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets to London 2012 - since he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say that you will never get the opportunity to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped breathing and died before I accepted that he was human", he said.
The year before Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to swim in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there is no better situation", he said.
He was also inspired in his first song selection - Pride by Heather Small - which he performed during the Olympic Games and was also a smoker.

Fatigued player Mickelson was booked for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American player Phil Mickelson was set to set a record on Sunday when he played in the 47th Ryder Cup, but had to change his style to avoid disappointment as a result.
Mickelson, who was playing in the 12th hole, was saved by captain Jim Furyk on four goals for the four-man Saturday.
Rather than being in the middle of the game, as is common in the United States, the five-time major champion divides his day between being motivated and working on his online game in the hope of fixing what he has.
Not being consistent in the drives or during his playing career, the 48-year-old is not suited to the level of the Le Golf course's elite league, where he is prone to severe torture and violent attacks.
And if the match itself doesn't work out, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces British heavyweight champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down, show that they will start 12 games of the season, and jump into the heat to start, Mickelson's performance will be crucial.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, even though he could say nothing more.
"He realized how important today was, leaned back and put his arm around me, saying he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk recalls.
"He was very self-confident.
He is one of the most popular heroes and has been promoted to the club before, and this week.
I never thought it was possible for him to play two games.
I expected more, but that was the plan and it was the path we thought we would take.
He wanted to be out there, like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
He could end a Ryder Cup match that would never match the historic high point of his career.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven games, although Furyk said his presence brought other important things to the team.
"He was funny, silly, charming, liked to make fun of people, and became a great actor in the theater", he said.
"I think the young players like to make fun of him, even this week, which is interesting.
It brings more than just knowledge.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that giving a big break will soon pass
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that getting a little break in the final few days of a Ryder Cup singles slide driving is also difficult.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led by five points over the Americans but only managed to finish the line with their lead in the most read, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama, we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only", said Bjorn, who described, after watching the 2018 Class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to reach 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Toh Tarihi will show me and everyone in this organization that it is not over yet.
You have full admission tomorrow.
go there and do everything right.
This is not complete until you find the weeks on the screen.
We have a goal, and it is to reach it, and that is where we will focus our efforts.
I said at the beginning, I was focused on the 12 players in our team, but we all know what's going on on the other side - they have world champions.
Knowing how these players performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go to heaven on my own.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is about making the next one, and it's also a different thing to do.
It's nice to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out on your own, you're being tested to the limit of your golfing ability.
That's the message you need to get to the athletes, is to bring out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your friends behind because he must put forth his best effort himself, as well".
Unlike Bjorn, number one contender Jim Furyk would ask his players to perform better than they did in the mix, which included Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on the verge of these recent major leagues, having been one of the players who won the tournament in Brookline before going on to lose as Europe eliminated "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every bad word", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had brought his players together to the final day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but then you start coming up as fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When stress enters one direction, it puts extreme pressure on the two medial nerves.
We set our standards accordingly and put the people in the style we want, you know, we try to surprise tomorrow".
Thomas was given the opportunity to try out for Rory McIlroy in the top flight alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half in the same format.
"I went with this group of people in this system because I thought it closed the whole way", Bjorn said of his choices.
The new German submarine has been delayed again
The new German Navy ship was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the older Cold War-era battleships. but it will not be until at least next year due to design flaws and high cost of snow, media reports have reported.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, which leads the new Baden-Wuerttemberg division, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, a report by Die Zeit reported.
The ship was scheduled to enter service with the Navy in 2014, but delivery problems delayed the completion of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will include a powerful fire station, aerial and naval weapons core and other advanced technologies, such as radar, infrared and sonic signature reduction.
Other important features include the long development time - new frigates should be used up to two years from the home ports.
However, the further delay meant that the warship's superiority - which would allow Germany to expand its naval capabilities - would be out of the question by the time it entered service, Die Zeit reports.
The F125 Frigate's failure made headlines last year, when German Navy officials refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss depot in Hamburg.
The wanna is the additional alarm the Navy will return to the shipbuilder upon delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media reported "defects in the program" that rendered the battleship useless if sent into combat.
The Manhaja shortage was of such importance that it was managed by a crew of 120 Baden-Wuerttemberg sailors.
He also explained that the ship had a heavy weight that reduced its performance and limited the ability of the navy to make further improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" "was as heavy as the German battleships of World War II.
In addition to the poor equipment, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the workers - is a problem.
It is said to be worth around €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems facing new frigates have become more important in the wake of recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, commander-in-chief of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the actual ship was "first to emerge when the right-hand ships were launched".
The official said the problem was fixed in time, because the older ships were stopped but the replacements were not delivered.
He was saddened that none of the Baden-Wuerttembergers had boarded the boat.
The integrity of the bat's life
A recent study in a Scottish Highland forest area aims to explain how bats use space to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results of the study will provide new insights into the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The researchers and scientists at the Scottish Amity Museum will follow the butterfly and soprano pipistrelles with brown and long-eared jackals and Daubenton jackals in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special sound sensor will be installed at different locations in the product cycle to monitor the bat's behavior in all the samples.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile phone searches using handheld searches.
The results of the sound analysis by experts of all vocal cords can help to determine the frequency of calls and what each species is doing.
Maps and custom reports will be provided to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a climate consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas are most important to the community and how they use each.
This information will help determine the use of home management tasks such as tool production and the best way to manage the bat forest and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and other parts of Britain has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that involve tears and loss of housing.
Wind and electric light can be hazardous, as can newspapers and other building chemicals, and the attacks of domestic pests.
The fact is that bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal nature, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use the triggering of the system to listen for sounds and detect insects and objects that are blocking their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 conservation areas, 38 botanical gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, considers bats and bats extremely important.
He had ten missions, often searching, searching for collections of mummies and sometimes rescuing.
The factory also opened Scotland's first and only alligator sanctuary at Threave Estate in Dumfires and Galloway, which has 8 of Scotland's 10 alligator species.
Property Manager David Thompson said the property is a regional best fit for them.
"Here in Threave we have a good area for the community", he said.
We had old houses, old trees, and nice sheds.
But there is much more about the insects that is unknown, so our actions on this treasure will help us to identify some of the things they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of taking precautions before the property is managed as it is possible that the destruction of the women's home could lead to the death of up to 400 of their wives and children, which could potentially wipe out the local bird population.
The goats were protected from being killed, disturbed or disturbed, or their homes destroyed.
Elisabeth Ferrel, of the Scottish University of the Gender Centre, called for people to join forces to help.
She said: We have a lot to learn about the bats and their many species but we don't know how many are there.
Ronaldo denied the rape allegations while lawyers were preparing to file a lawsuit against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called out the allegations of rape on "false news", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to appeal the case to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the matter, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking via his Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
The answer is no.
What they said today, is a fake news, says the five Ballon d'Or winners in the camera.
They wanted to promote themselves by using my name.
That is understandable.
They wanted to make a name for themselves by calling my name, but that was part of the job.
"I am a calm person and whatever happens", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's defense lawyers plan to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unfounded reports on allegations of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek a fine for defamation of character, in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the crime, which may be the most serious human rights violation in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a large Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the face, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga admitted that Ronaldo fell on his knees afterwards and told her 99% a good person who gets the opposite from 1%.
Their documents claim that Ronaldo believed that they had had sex, but only in agreement.
Mayorga also admitted that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in hospital, but later settled out of court because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about "face-to-face" beatings.
The 34-year-old is now trying to turn the page as she continues to struggle with the pain of what started.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and the same day he joined Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever lose its car manufacturers
UK would have known it forever if it lost its position as the leader of the post-Brexit car industry, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it would sell temporary jobs at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Mr Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which includes Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year of which 90 percent were exported to the rest of Europe.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a call-up in our factories", said Mavin Cooke, Toyota Managing Director at Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border business will look, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its small Oxford plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what the carmakers have said about the risk of having a supply shortage in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's control system is implemented on a "gab-by-time" basis, with parts arriving within 37 minutes from suppliers from all over the UK and EU for so-called minibuses.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border which the industry says could cause delays and parts shortages.
It is not possible for Toyota to maintain more than one day's worth of equipment at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, as it would buy enough work.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's anti-EU probe was originally designed to avoid such investigations at the border.
"We need to get a deal.We want to get the best deal that gives us the opportunity as I said not only the benefits we will enjoy at the moment but to get to use this opportunity", he said on the Today programme of BBC Radio 4.
The argument not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers is that we are fundamentally in need of sustaining the success of the manufacturing sector.
Toyota could not say how long the sale would take, but in the long run, they warned that prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union spokesman at the factory, said their members are constantly worried: In my experience once these jobs are gone they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: We have submitted a clear and transparent framework for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed forward by a week as the battle over top court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special counsel Robert Mueler project, which investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's staff and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether or not Trump would fire the deputy judge, putting Mueller's freedom at risk, has been a Washington rumor for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had a phone conversation to record his interview with Trump and a possible impeachment of the President on the 25th.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reportedly to receive a reception.
Instead, his meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a Congressional Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and another woman accused of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-step FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, further delaying the Congressional elections.
Trump's press secretary, Sara Saunders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "We have not set a date for this, it could be this week, I think it could be moved to a week from now based on all the developments in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and we will continue to report to the press".
Some journalists may disagree with this statement: Sanders has not given a speech at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of the speech was not because of a problem for TV viewers, "although she added: "I will not deny the fact that they are valuable".
She then suggested seeing Trump in person to increase the press coverage.
"The president has done more Q&A in private than any president before him", she said, without providing any evidence: "We looked at these numbers".
The speech will still be long, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions, it's better to do it directly than to talk to me.
We tried to do that very hard and you saw us do it very hard in the last few weeks and that will be a very brief speech when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends an opening or press conference with visiting guests.
Keeping a press conference secret was difficult.
In New York City this week, the president showed why, by showing off his power and appearing at unusual times before press conferences.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff on NHS Scotland to express gratitude for the country and their desire to stay post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months to leave until Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already struggled to meet the costs of meeting the needs of EU citizens working in public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, talks between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to this grand decision.
But the British Government continued to prepare for possible disagreements.
I know this moment must be very uncomfortable for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize once again how each worker is worthy of his contribution, regardless of nationality.
Staff from across the EU, and beyond, provide valuable expertise to strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is our perfect home and we would prefer you to live here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean Organic Company reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
He went straight to the side line and fell here", Reed said.
Trainees and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side of the line before placing him on the bed and returning him for further evaluation.
The official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrobie had emerged from surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there is no specific information on the type/number of pot injuries" and the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with the Tennessee Titans after transferring from Illinois.
He had five strokes on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his grandmother up to 18 strokes.
Buyers will be charged higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Buyers will be charged higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK with extra cash used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme.
This move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting younger voters
The stamp project will affect tax exempt people in Britain
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Overseas buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK - with more money being spent on homeless relief, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to derail Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters with promises to provide affordable housing and to impose tough measures.
The stamp duty would rise to target individuals and corporations for non-payment of taxes in the UK, with more money to fund government efforts to combat insomnia.
The increase - which is in addition to the current stamping process, including the measures introduced two years ago on two homes and the purchase of rental property - could be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that about 13% of new London building materials are purchased from foreigners living in Britain, the prices are rising and making it difficult for first-time buyers to find affordable housing.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who are mostly not resident in the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp drive to help young people who own their own homes.
He accused the big construction companies of saving expensive goods by taking land without using it, and urged Mrs May to leave income on the houses to address "the housing problem in Britain".
Mr Corbyn announced a package of planned housing reforms, including a rent-free system and an end to the 'non-tax' on exports.
He also wanted to give the legislature the authority to build houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my power to restoring the British dream - that life is better for each new generation.
And this means the rebuilding of the ruined market places.
Britain will remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is incorrect to say that it is easier for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For many the dream of owning a home becomes more remote, and the pain of poor sleep becomes more real".
Jack Ross: 'My biggest dream is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said that his "dream" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited to challenge back the North-East League side, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League for the first time.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B hat and this is it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Voices.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden a lot with my father as a kid, and he had something in his jaw.
This opportunity would come, however, if I succeeded in managing the organization".
Those who preceded Ross as Sunderland managers included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic president said he was not afraid of what these names would bring to such a big club, after a bidding war between Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The question for me at that time was 'can I get the team back to the Premier League?'
Given the organization and resources in this organization, it is not surprising that we are the Freemium Games", he said.
"It's not easy to get him there, but I can see myself as successful here if I can get the team there".
Ross was only three years into his managerial career, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts' training camp.
He also helped Alloa re-establish itself in the third tier, and re-invented St Mirren from their Championship role the following season.
And Ross said he was having more fun than he ever had when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"He became very susceptible and confused", he recalled, taking over the leadership of Alloa.
"I really believed that running was better for me, than playing.
It was amazing because I had tried, had a good life out of it, and enjoyed some prestige.
But play can be a challenge.
You may face many challenges each week.
I still keep this issue in mind due to the pressures and pressures of the job but management feels the same.
I have always wanted to run and now I am, and I am very happy to be in the race for the rest of my life".

The time for a full pint is 5.30pm on Saturday, the survey shows
The heat wave has boosted the entrance to Britain's competing leisure centres but has added pressure on restaurants.
Resorts and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July but restaurants fell 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA's marketing manager, who included the figures, said: "It continued to shine with England ahead of the World Cup in July, following a similar trend to last June, when it was 2.8 percent, but most restaurants were more crowded.
The 1.8 percent drop in food sales in June alone was worse in July.
The bars and pubs were more vibrant with their variety than the restaurants that were less so.
The food stalls also suffered from the sun, but not as much as the restaurant workers.
The crowd was apparently eager to get out for a drink.
In all places where alcohol and tobacco are consumed sales were up 6.6 percent for the month, and food less than three percent".
"These results have been consistent since late April", says Paul Newman, a leisure analyst and RSM professor.
The environment and the impact of major social events or sporting events are major factors when it comes to sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant associations are still struggling, to prevent a drop to 4.8 percent a year because it would be a major pain on the price pressure.
A prolonged heat wave cannot come at the worst time for food processors like this and time will tell the most moderate weather we experienced in August will provide the necessary delay".
Total sales revenue across bars and restaurants, including openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the company's exports.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Business Monitoring Unit monitors UK businesses, pubs and restaurants collecting and analysing economic data from 47 active organisations, with a turnover of over $9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children has a private website that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a private website that they hide from their parents and teachers, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta
The article further reinforced the fear that sexual content is being published
20% of students said they have a "personal" website to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has created a website that hides adults.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram pages - references and photo sharing on the Instagram social network.
The article further reinforced the fear that sexual information was being published.
Twenty percent of the children said they use a "real" clean site to show parents, while they have a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's private Web site found a teenager begging others to "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds have dual profiles, and half of them confidently have personal profiles.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: It is a concern that many youngsters are willing to open websites where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle to be "voice of the players" at Scottish Sports Authority
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Sports Authority board as a junior director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and manager Ian Beattie said this was a great opportunity for those leading the sport to have the opportunity to use her at an international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected among the Scottish community, the British and the international athletic community, and we are sure the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing her to the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in doing voice-over work for athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help to the sporting leadership in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in a total of four Olympic medals and is now a regular BBC pundit, has been unable to walk after suffering from a rare blood disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: Today a month ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how far.
It was a grueling exercise but he made a full recovery, learned to walk again and today he is doing more physical exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An advertisement for a breast tattoo depicting mothers and cows has been circulating on the internet
A breast tattoo company distributed a concept on the internet with an advertisement depicting breastfeeding mothers and cows being tattooed.
To mark the launch of what is being billed as "the world's first implantable breast tattoo device", tech company Elvie released a colorful music video ad to highlight the freedom the new pump offers mothers.
The real mothers danced in a circle and sang to a song with lyrics like: "Yes, I shave my head, but you can't see my tail" and "If you don't notice that these are not my breasts, these are my breasts".
"Squeeze him, push him, I feed the children, push him, push him, I suckle my wife".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's website, caused a stir online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reviews from viewers, with many comments expressing "disgust" at the dairy industry.
It is a bad idea to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they should get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only to have their babies stolen from their cribs after they are born", wrote another.

Another said: There is a concern for mother and baby.
but why not use the breast pump advertisement for parents who want to save their babies?
Another added: Telling is meaningless.
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "lovely".
"I think that was a wise decision.
I bought one where I still breastfeed.
The smell of the machine is like a cow.
The truth is a little crazy but I take it for what it is.
"I think this is a wise advice", wrote someone.
Another said: tallar is a fun and ideal activity for women who are strolling (especially at work or in the bathroom) and feel like drunk.
This is not a complimentary ad or a lawsuit against a dairy company.
At the end of the video, the women's group shows themselves dancing wearing a pumpkin on their nipples.
The aim of this campaign was to research that breastfeeding women feel like a baby.
The Elvie pump, however, is no-stroke, has no wires or tubes and fits into a breast-feeding jacket, allowing women freedom to move, hold babies, and even go outside while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner with ECD and parent commented: Pamfon Elvie is a revolutionary product that is compatible with bold and poor presentation.
By drawing a line between the portrayal of women and cows we put the breast tattoo and all the challenges in the spotlight, while showing in an interesting setting and how it can show the freedom that the new faucet will bring.
this is not the first time that Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared to be gay for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the model.
Hundreds of refugee children slowly head to a sacred camp on the Texas border
The number of detained refugee children has increased despite the monthly border crossing remain unchanged, in part because opposition to policies introduced by the Trump administration has made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors have been illegal immigrants, and they fear losing their right to remain in the country by continuing to need children.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other minority residents at home would have to give their hand tattoos, and information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief executive of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the parliament that the agency had arrested several people who sought to support minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who have supporters or domestic supporters are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of those are criminals.
So we keep following these people", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which is the previous standard, according to the prosecutors.
Many will come out by video conference call, rather than in person, to make their case, as a judge.
Those who were considered unworthy of help were restored.
Many of their children are in a safe house, most of them wanting to get stressed or shaken, which can lead to violence or attempts to escape, according to emergency personnel and reports from the system recently.
Advocates say those affected are especially vulnerable in large homes like Tornillo's, a place where signs that a struggling child is easily overlooked, due to his size, are common.
They add that sending children back to the tent city without enough time to prepare their minds or to make peace with their peers can only add to the frustration that many of them suffer.
Sham tells US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw without delay
In an address to the United Nations, Foreign Minister al-Moualem called on the refugees to return home, despite the civil war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the country's forces were illegally operating under the banner of the war on terror, and would be dealt with appropriately.
They should withdraw without delay and without any conditions, he told the crowd.
Moualem insisted that the War on Terrorism is almost over in Sham, a place where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, with millions of people homeless.
He said Damascus would continue the King's War until all the Shams were cleared of all terrorist groups and any illegal personnel.
The US has some 2,000 troops in Sham, mostly providing training and advice to the Sham's Kurdish and Arab forces who are hostile to President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the situation has improved and they are returning, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "increasing unjustified fear" that refugees refuse to return.
"We appeal to the international community and aid organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
They are political and it is all about compassion.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the reconstruction of Sham until an agreement is reached between Assad and the anti-war rebels.
UN liaison officials say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to isolate the last major rebel-held area of Idlib provides an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish pact ended the massive Russian-backed Sham invasion of the province, home to three million people.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military operation would focus on terrorism with al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be dealt with.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to soon convene the first meeting of a committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for the post-Sham war country and open the way for elections.
Moualem issued a statement calling for the government of Sham to join the committee, saying that the task of the parties should be limited to revising the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Won Re-election
Under this strategy, Mr. Trump would run for a second term in 2020 unless, as many Liberal Party members had hoped, the scandal and embarrassment ended his presidency prematurely.
A no-confidence vote would be the most amazing end to a presidency ever!
At this point, there is no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have risen from more than two to 1.05 million households on CNN and nearly three to 1.6 million households on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average prime-time audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show dominated cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime-time nights.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it is not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the congressional secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of Just a Funny Thing: Some Uncomfortable Truths About Getting Stained into the Hollywood Male Community, has another suggestion.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would choose Mr. Trump.
What is it? she asked.
"What, 'cause it makes me laugh", Mr. Scovell told us.
There is value in recreation in the midst of chaos.
Well, unlike anything on television, the news coming out of Washington can determine the outcome of Roe v. Wade, whether refugees can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Going out was a privilege that only select few could have.
And in that, it's more than being a national celebrity when you find yourself in six hours of watching their panel of experts discuss the use of "deep data" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear", "Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket" (a thick and expensive suit, says the Washington Post) and the importance of the detailed, um, body of Mr Trump and Stormy Daniel.
I, in particular, never watch Super Mario as much as I used to.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a real game is he feeds you something every night", said Brent Mongomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, "on Trump's game-changing players and structure (the NFL draft, and Kim Jong-un's praise)".
You do not want to miss a bone or be left behind.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this weekend, it was a very hot 80 degrees outside his house on the northern tip of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the scene, not with Brett Kavanaugh facing the House Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were playing comedy games back then and people said, 'this is white collar education,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out to be true.

Foreign currency has filled the most recent midterm elections for MPs
It is no wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a lot of money, thanks to the congressional redistricting that brought two governors in a race for one seat.
This new redistricting system outside of Pittsburgh includes Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb - who won a seat in a special election last summer.
Lamb was running alongside another Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represented Pennsylvania's former 12th District, which is closely tied to the new 17th.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old county boundaries were unlawfully merged in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th opened the way for financial competition between the major party funds, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a resounding victory in a highly-watched March 18 primary election for the Pennsylvania State Assembly.
This seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democratic Party a slight chance of victory.
US considers sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, then breaks
Liaison officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already been in contact with Beijing, with a small push from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until business associates fired Trump's campaign managers.
Foreign Service officials decided to recall senior US liaison staff in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the recent decision to suspend testimony in Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only nine were studied for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development support and economic development.
The study's findings, which included cutting subsidies and curbing visas, would have devastated the Central American country, which suffers from high unemployment and high inflation.
As the House session was in progress, North and Central American officials suspended a high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity to delay last year's summit which was seen as a step to prevent migration to the United States.
But by mid-September, government officials expressed their desire for the convention to continue, so that the ban on El Salvador could be lifted.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the summit, scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the introduction of government services to the summit, the ambassador said.
And three US ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate revealed by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to hold a private meeting.
their statements were verified by an analyst close to the government and spoke in confidence.
Reading the History
The next shoe to drop could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible impeachment, which is now highly evidence-based in public records.
Mr. Mueller reportedly turned his attention to finding out if Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress were to act, Mr. Trump would find himself in the crosshairs of the coalition, as he is preparing to return to the electorate, and perhaps be among its leaders.
There are many question marks, and I'm not saying Mr. Trump's fall is impossible - only for his generation in Europe.
A choice facing us all on both sides of the Atlantic that could affect how long a battle might be fought.
In 1938, German officials planned a coup against Hitler, when the West rejected him and sided with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed.
Historical records warn of such a problem, and the process of forced democracy is neither hasty nor slow.
Americans are experiencing a lot of this fatigue right now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who was leading Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since the same paper reported that, last year, he secretly advised the president and considered his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the latest FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or untrue - or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite numerous sexual harassment allegations and false evidence?
And in all, are we going to vote mid-term for a congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in a long winter.
But the battle was not to be lost, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by this Nazi regime who had once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and some 60 years later, she sent me to light a sabbath candle on a table there with a swastika.
With this as my inheritance, how can I be optimistic about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is confident ahead of Rapid Vienna's encounter
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that its victory over the Austrians, after scoring in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use this result as a youngster to great things.
"It's a good score for us because Villarreal is good", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game believing that we could win something and survive by one week
We might have eaten them at the end, but, in general, the horse's ear can be a good result.
They were the best in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best side.
It was Thursday, a big night in Europe.
We were hopeful, we could get three points but that would be a tough challenge because they had a good result in the final but, with our crowd of fans, I am sure we can push for a good result.
The past year has been difficult, with injuries and organizational changes, but now there are positive signs.
The band is beautiful and the kids are so happy; exercise is good.
Hopefully, we can push now, put the last season behind us and win".
Women can't sleep because they're afraid of losing their retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had an opinion about how they wanted to be treated, few people shared it with their family.
Nearly half of the people in a nationwide study said that they discussed long-term financial matters with their spouses.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about it.
"These people want family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Insurance Institute.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your family and counselors to discuss who and what to take care of, as these options set priorities for determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you to find ways to pay for your expenses.
Your choice of long-term care coverage may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, a junior financial priority insurance policy to help cover those costs or self-insurance with your own cost-of-living allowance.
Get your legal documents: Get rid of legal battles in the past.
Find a local health-care representative so that you can choose a trusted health-care professional and make sure that your needs are met even if you cannot speak.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your expenses.
You choose one person you trust to make decisions about your finances and to make sure that the bills are paid even if you cannot afford to pay.
remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is sick and needs urgent care and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and illness?
Write these details on a piece of paper so that you can prepare.
"It's not just about money, but about the doctors", Martin asked.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, officials said, with more deaths expected.
Due to lack of communication, security officials did not receive any information from Donggala regency, a region in northern Palu that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster began.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the coast on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was commemorating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a type of coral that travels more than 300 miles (180 km) along the coast of the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The constituency, a national level constituency in the province, elects approximately 299,200 members as of 2017.
agriculture is the mainstay of the economy of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the southern tip of Sulawesi.
Paman and Donggala have experienced several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A similar tsunami struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake in the western coast of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December last year caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes occurred in the western island of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that extends along the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of small towns and killed about 300 people.
2016: A devastating earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people are reminded of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died when buildings collapsed.
2018: A magnitude magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in a temporary state of shock.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on suspicion of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska senator and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of sexual assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, and interfering with domestic violence reports and, according to a report released by Alaska State Troopers, on Saturday.
According to police reports, if a woman tries to call the police to report alleged crimes, he takes her phone away from her
Palin was placed in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 bail agreement, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, in fact" when questioned, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class I felonies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first time Palin was accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with the murder of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, disorderly conduct and reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized on the incident by veterans groups in 2016 after he linked her family's attitudes to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication were down with expectations of more deaths in the coming days.
The quake originated just off the central Sulawesi in northeastern Indonesia, Jakarta.
A video of the incident has been circulating on social media showing the impact of the incident.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for NYC terrorist
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City attack that killed eight people - the highest sentence for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a local truck to carry out attacks on the machine-gun road and along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, targeting pedestrians and cyclists on his route in October.
To secure the death penalty, prosecutors will prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "deliberately" inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to the death penalty notice, filed in the Southern District of New York.
All of these defendants were sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 charges including eight counts of aiding and abetting murder, mostly by prosecutors in organized crime, and charges of assault and vehicular manslaughter.
The attack required "serious planning and prosecution", prosecutors said, describing how Saipov considered it "vicious, brutal and ruthless".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, illness, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent states.
Five of the dead were Argentine tourists
It has been ten years since the southern state of New York reinstated the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was sentenced to death in September 2009.
The latter was the case when the federal death penalty was imposed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple after being convicted of conspiring for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no mercy in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He explained to investigators that he was happy with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had gained confidence after carrying out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the allegations.
He also demanded that the Isis flag be flown in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal civil rights advocates in Saipov state, said they were "reluctant" with the decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a criminal's sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole would address the problems of the common man", Patton said.
Saipov's defense lawyers have asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to rebel today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians were "hot" by Eurosceptic businessmen - as one of Theresa May's representatives suggested she should consider talks with the EU.
A recent supporter, Peter Bone, told reporters in Birmingham that Britain would leave as soon as Mr Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges Mrs May faced in negotiating the deal and the inter-party tensions suggested that the Pro-Remain Tories were taking part in the Brexit protests in the city.
Fremiya is facing regulatory challenges and its researchers have been preparing for the road in the face of attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Friends insisted that she push ahead with her efforts to strike a deal with Brussels regardless of the outcome - and force the Europeans and Labour to choose between her and 'confusion'.
Mr Bone told AFP news agency that he wanted to 'look at' the 'Investigators'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be a candidate and hand over responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been the supervisor, we would have been out of here by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand by Brexit but we need to look at the analysts.'
Speaking against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to be humble.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wanted to be wrong is wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was on the march, reporting: I'm just saying: Frem minister listened to people.
'The investigators would have no real connection with the public, the Opposition would have no votes, without our party and our activists, who have marred the streets and made us vote from the start.
Please download the Investigators and start listening.'
In a message to Mrs May, she added: 'Their Prime Ministers continue their work as long as they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told politicians that politicians must start 'feeling the pain' if they want to defeat the fraud in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now about the issue of how between us - the people - and the politicians', he said.
'They are trying to trick Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you go along doing so'.
In a message to the cheering crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are close to betraying Brexit, feel pain.
'We are rallying the troops of this country that won us Brexit and we will not rest until we are independent, sovereign, and proud of Britain.'
Meanwhile, Remainers toured Birmingham before a two-hour tour of the city centre
The hardline activist raised the Tories' stance on Brexit after the party was launched over the holidays.
Labour's Lord Adonis lashed out at the Conservatives over security concerns they had suffered with the party's applications during the opening session.
"These are the people who told us that they can have IT systems in one place and all the technology of Canada, for a limited time, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
'It was a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit, he added.
Warren will make "good study" of the Presidential nomination
US Sen. Elizaberth said she would make "a good study of the Presidential nomination after the November election".
The Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Congressman Jaha GOP. Geoff Diehl, who was the 2016 Massachusetts presidential candidate for Trump.
She was at the center of speculation that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with residents using the town hall system since Trump took office.
A delegate asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to reform our government and that includes women up there",
Arrested in LSU Sims shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released the video of the shooting on Friday, and are asking for help to identify the man seen in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being there, carrying a gun and a gun with him, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident, and he was taken into custody at the police station in East Baton Rouge.
A 6-foot-6 kid who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the World Cup when the drivers give him a chance to beat Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' drivers would play a key role in the race.
From pole, Bottas started well and nearly hung Hamilton to dry while defending his position in the first two and invited Vettel to attack the challenger.
Vettel entered the first round and left Hamilton to enter the traffic at the tail end of the pack, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes crossed the line behind and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a close race against a Ferrari driver who left him voluntarily in good holding position after two attempts to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in the seventh position after finishing first on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race while holding the tyre to reach the finish line quickly and took a fourth-place lead over Kimi Raikkonen.
He then entered the field in the 44th round but was unable to improve his form in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen came in fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had worked hard all weekend and was very kind to me.
The team performed admirably and won first and second place, according to Hamilton.
This is a bad sign
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a patrol meeting on Saturday over her allegation that she failed to release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Addressing a patrol in West Virginia, the president used Ford's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee instead of saying that what was happening in the Senate was a demonstration of the "dishonest liars".
"One thing that can happen and a good thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when they see anger, when they see angry and hard-line people and disingenuous liars", he said.
If you look at the re-release and leakage of personal information and they say "You, not me".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Remember her answer ... did you pull out this piece of paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. It was a dream.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we expel him... No, we did not expel him", he added, as the senator pointed out.
A letter containing the Kavanaugh allegations was sent to Feinstein from Ford in July, and the document came out in early September - but Feinstein denied the allegations that the document came from the office.
"I did not hide Dr. Zargin, I did not release her story", Feinstein told the panel, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she told me".
But her disapproval did not mean she got to the president, who commented during a Saturday night patrol meeting: I'll tell you something, That's a bad sign of physical abuse.
Maybe not, but that was the worst sign of physical abuse I've ever seen".
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominees, who were accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president recommended that the Democratic party use the charges to satisfy their demands.
They are determined to take power in any form.
You see the evil, the injustice, they don't care about those who are hurt, who will hurt to gain power and power, Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by the first team
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars avenged their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were the first to score two goals in a game, with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier leading the way.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home a field goal before Dwyer again led the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored a late penalty against Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals became their winner.
This was the third time that the Elite League lost to Adam Keefe, who later lost 2-1 to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute with 3:35 left from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist and Beauvillier doubling the lead to two four minutes early.
The game was a gamble from the start, with Sullivan returning home the game in the 13:10 mark before Matt Marquardt became a backup in the 15-16 win over Cownie's horse's ear.
Dwyer proved that the Giants had the lead in the game at the first time of asking when he scored the second goal of the night late that season.
The team behind changed their style and Buchard again scored a powerful ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen to give Dundee a lead for the first time in the game in the final two games and secure a fifth place finish in the team standings in the final two games.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure the lives of people on board survive the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero for having ensured the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and dozens missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Small earthquakes of magnitude 7 continue to plague the area, and many people are in turmoil in Palu.
But despite his teammates fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the tower construction site at Maniara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He went on to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was attempting to take off at the time, had taken off safely.
He jumped off the tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the ruling could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a high-speed train to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a large hospital in another town.
Sadly, we missed him that morning before the anchor ship reached Palu.
"Our hearts are overwhelmed at hearing this report", he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands and the national disaster risk reduction agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that there is a possibility of a higher death toll as many bodies are under the wreckage while the exact number is still unknown", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the group.
A six-meter-high waterfall destroyed Palu which will be buried in the same spot on Sunday.
Military planes and chartered aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in a body.
Clean water is hard to come by.
Small businesses are being seized everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is coming quickly to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's sad, but it could be better".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I order you all to work day and night to complete all export related tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier that year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crash
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after it said all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement released that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to identify a single male.
The airline said it was working with authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or age
traditional boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane sank while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events were not known.
The Air Force and the United States Navy both said the plane landed in the river bank due to a short runway.
Some witnesses thought the ship had gone off course.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed violently.
"This is a good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to travel into the deep water to open the emergency door to the sinking ship.
The crew members were confused and shouted, and he suffered severe head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that the ship's engineers were working nearby to improve the harbor and helped rescue by using wind-operated boats to transport people to the shore before the ship sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Centre shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Investigators have released the campsite from the night the woman was burned alive
The judge suspended his trial on Saturday when a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 was sentenced.
U.S. Justice Department investigator Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert eyewitness in the investigation.
He explained to the jury how he used a cell phone recorder to track down 29-year-old criminal Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett claimed to have received location data from several cellphones which indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting earlier allegations, according to Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that his phone was with Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford had picked up a bag on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "sleeping, because the car was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before her death.
phone records show that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale says.
The hearing of his defendants will begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be presented to the jury after that day.

Rapid Rising Genre, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has left it with a core of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop popular that will restore their status.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common saw a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and LowKey.
A black man?!
NY child welfare worker punishes couple for firing after "racist" text
A New York child welfare worker sues a couple for unlawful dismissal after an unsolicited text from a mother complaining that she is "another black woman"
The couple denied that they were racist, that the case was related to love
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed concern when it was discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black from arrival on her first day of work in 2016.
aaaaaaaaaaa A NEW hope, said Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a note.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, "disgruntled" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their former employee, who was African-American, had behaved badly and was expecting to be brought in Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid her daily wage and then sent home by uber.
Meanwhile, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation on her divorce, and she is seeking to pay her daughter $350 a day for six months, as is the rent for the job she was hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I wanted to show them, look, you don't do things like that", she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's racist".
The couple replied that we were not showing any signs of racism, saying that they should have fired Maurice, because they were afraid that she would not trust them after the crime.
My wife even sent me something that was not meant to be a fight.
It is not racially biased.
we are not racist, Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you have offended, even if she is guilty?
A newborn baby?
not really.
comparing the case to kwace, Plasco said his wife was pregnant and had a baby less than two months ago and was therefore in a "difficult situation".
"Would you support such a thing?
This is not good", said the investment banker.
While the trial was in progress, the court of public opinion quickly spotted the couple on the news, criticizing them for their behavior and the system.
Paddington book publishers fear readers won't want to be associated with talking dolls, new letter reports
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, a poet born shortly after the book was approved, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It is good now to know what we know about Paddington's great victory".
Noting that her father, who worked as a photographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book in the form of a doll, would have done well if the book had not been well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "difficult and sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, who she described as "an important member of our family", she said her father was proud of his great success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not arrogant", she said.
"But because Paddington was so honest with him, he said it was your son's big achievement: you'd be proud of them even if you weren't.
I think he saw Paddington's success, in that way.
Although he was his own creation and his own mind, he always paid homage to Paddington himself".
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"I called him repeatedly to say that he was very ill, that he had suddenly fallen asleep", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
"Get up, my dear, I love you very much", I said.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication that doctors had been missing to keep her heart functioning, slowly stopped working and they stopped her.
She died a few days ago and that covers it all.
I had to sit back and wait, knowing that everything would be fine.
I could not cry or scream because I was surrounded by brothers and sisters and people.
I tried my best to stay calm.
Finally Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, still reeling from the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - despite the tragedy she was in.
No one knows, she is.
I fell to the ground, and I cried constantly.
It's very hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I first felt a deep compassion for Nad.
How he needs to be loved and understood.
Just how much he loves her.
The brave women send cards to stop the killers on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones and witnessed their own deaths work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were also making postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
 Ms Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a pain-ridden donor.
Everyone knows him by his smile.
They often say that his smile lights up every room.
Yet, he left the work before he died, while "in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother dead after committing suicide.
"I am still worried that there is a possibility of a hit on the result", Ms Davis said.
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't sit still - you should talk.
Ms Humphreys, who was a single mother to Ms Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, following the recent death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or stressed or anything", she says.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the base of the mountain on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he refused to look at them,
She said that his death was a big problem for them, but they had to work through it: "It leaves a hole in the family.
He confused us.
But we have to keep fighting and living.

Brett Kavanaugh's identity hangs in the balance, as the FBI begins an investigation
"I think, if we can get something like what he is looking for - just a short-term study, at least - how can we bring a little cooperation", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "divided" by too many political views.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reason for their lack of interest is time.
The midterm elections are five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans don't make an effort, then they will be hit hard in their bid to tie up the man they want to nominate to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was on the phone calling Senators, begging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces a report?
Elections will be held for the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Mike Pence, the vice president, a break with the offer and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean resignations is falling under Kim
The number of North Koreans defecting to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean policy analyst said.
Park Byeong-seug, who reports from the South Korean Ministry of Cooperation, said there was a drop of 1,127 resignations last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said increased border security between North Korea and China and higher prices for insect repellents were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not commented on the matter.
Most North Korean retirees are awarded South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people have fled China, which shares a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the retired as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and thus repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - still at war - improved within a few months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks related to the nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic June summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a deal that would lead to the country's denuclearization.
Following a June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, they agreed to sign an agreement to use the Northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
"Without the trust of the United States, we cannot trust our security, and in such circumstances, there is no way to destroy our weapons ourselves", Mr Ri said in his address to the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "ridiculous", said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Chief Home Secretary Nancy Pelosi, calling Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, said he was "not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at a Texas Tribune concert in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman ever did something like this, they would say 'ridiculous,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has compassionately denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both children.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed his deep sympathy, at times almost shouting and trembling while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also publicly criticized the Democratic Party on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a terrorist attack, a deliberate decline in morality", organized by the rebels, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she accepted that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was discriminatory toward Democrats.
"I think he showed his incompetence with these statements and the way he followed the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi avoided when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only is the Supreme Court not right for him, but also the current court", Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possibility of Kavanaugh's ruling on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was being judged to be a conservative judge.
During the evidentiary hearing, Kavanaugh asked some questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court rulings.
"This is not the time for a joke, one that doesn't want to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not weird,'" Pelos said.
And Women Need to Use It.
He was justly polite, months and years of anger had passed, and she could not vent it, without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is very cool, you know?"
She continues, "I got help from a manager in a home, who said she cried when she was angry, but she kept using a technique that means when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry".
Then she continued on her way.
And I thought that was a good thing".
The case of a misunderstanding is a case of misunderstanding.
One of the most vivid memories from my first job, in an office filled with men, where I once cried with unbounded rage, an elderly woman came to my neck - and a gentle boss whom I always doubted - slid down the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
They may not realize that you are angry.
They think you're lonely and they'll be happy to find you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an adulterous relationship on a Monkey Business boat and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, stating that there was no reason to prevent her from expanding her mind that she would run for president herself.
"That was a bad decision", she laughs 30 years later.
"There were seven other contestants in the race, and they needed someone else.
Another called it "Snow White and Seven Moons".
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind in earning money, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
This is a war we are losing.
She found out that some of her fans had given $1,000 to men who would only give her $250.
"Do you think I feel better?" she asked.
When she presented her speech that she would not run for office, she said sympathetically - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that came with the difficulty of financing and enforcing voters instead of representatives, and anger at gender - that she was content with that.
"You'd think I was crazy", Ms. Schroeder recalls of the pressures she faced.
"You think Kleenex was a weight-bearing system of some sort.
I remember thinking, oil is going to be put on my grave?
She cried?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The potential for a trade war between the US and China is strong, and the problem is not a one-off, between the two countries and could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and dalmatian.
The biggest increase this week was in tariffs on US$200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, so that one-third of the goods coming into the US from China can be paid for.
Beijing has retaliated in one form or another, recently increasing tariffs from five percent to ten percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to use the US shoot me-shoot-you system, and the world's second largest economy is not planning to go anywhere near it.
Making Washington withdraw also means being in the hunt, but publicly withdrawing from the US would be even more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the United States can support China in the long term by reducing economic dependence.
"The fact that a hasty policy decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to a downturn in the economy of any country is more dangerous than observers previously believed", says Abigail Grace, a researcher with Asia at the New America Security Institute, a think tank.
Syria is ready to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to take in the refugees who have returned voluntarily and are asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and positive thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by terrorists in an effort to restore order.
All the conditions are now in place to repatriate refugees to the country they left due to terrorism and economic measures that affect their daily lives and their environment.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have been displaced since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in his country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept support or aid from countries that supported the violence.
Europe to host the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup and defeated the US team in the 2018 final the match ended with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight to a European nation and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was crowned again by Denmark captain Thomas Bjorn who scored 14.5 points which they needed to beat the United States.
American heavyweight Phil Mickelson, who scored the game's only goal, threw a water polo ball on the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari his shot.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of the events, becoming the first player 1-for-4 to go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth came out on 5&4 among the lowest scoring players in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's leading player, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter who played in the Ryder Cup final.
Former eight-time Ryder Cup player, Serbia Garcia became the all-time winner of the European Cup with 25.5 points.
I have cried a few times, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
I was so grateful that Thomas took me in and accepted me.
I was happy, very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", Garcia said in a sympathetic tone after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who opened the American football Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in Sunday's singles match.
"I feel so proud, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record for the most career Ryder Cup wins.
A stunning statistic from one of the greatest athletes of all time, he won 14 medals second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team struggled over the weekend to find the best routes without Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-flight golf in both sports.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing game to his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
One time this morning when we were in the heat of Europe.
We are clean.
My hat is off to Thomas.
He was a captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to get back together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I loved the 12 men and was proud to serve as captain.
You must put on your helmet.
We were well-prepared
