On an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police in a trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed to come to their home.
Lamb determined that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me", the letter, which authorities say was signed by Lamb, read.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot a popular professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university staff heard shots at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb made a fateful 911 call shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came to get him.
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to determine Lamb's motivation.
The details released by state investigators and the students and staff who knew him together created an image of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they enjoyed his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in appreciation of the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught social science and history together with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were tendencies towards problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was experiencing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb has previously requested a medical leave from Delta State University, citing a medical condition.
And he only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes to the university's recruiting staff meant that the Ph.D. that Lamb had worked so hard on would not have guaranteed him an automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb was obviously troubled".
We're not gonna get any more answers from Lamb.
After he left campus, police tracked him across the Arkansas state line back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile from his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed Washington State Coroner Methel Johnson.
Left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to the house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000, in 2009 teaching geography and education classes.
He got his doctorate in education this spring.
One of Lamba's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was this great older guy who had taught her guitar for years.
He was quite the heartbreaker back then.
He won the hearts of all the girls when he appeared", says Hairston, now 40 and living in suburban Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that adjoined the Gautier River arm.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19.
"She was devastated", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they would play together on occasional gigs.
Osteen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had played guitar and harmonica for an unknown crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple", he said.
We were making out and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, led a first-year seminar and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English professor.
He was married with three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boy's student government and student club.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, approximately 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight vigil.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
School started back on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back", LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis have reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this story.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now claim Lamb made a 911 call after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it's not hiring as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the toy and product maker says it's giving current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting this month, and will hire employees through October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire staff to help with the stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized the seat next to me was empty and I figured that Princess Diana would be sitting there", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The film begins, and I realize I'm on the verge of what could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" is a documentary about "Back to the Future", featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really, to me, the best travel documentary ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's rushed military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a Wednesday press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation insoluble".
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching the Iran nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real life
Some have tried to portray him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands as if in a joke.
And some are preparing for an implosion.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top of the ballot, they're not going to succeed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump in the lead by double digits, and some people are starting to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul's chances of nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership had paved the way for Herman Cain's rise, ultimately not winning a single position in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why he might stumble in the general election.
But outside groups like the Super PAC Jeb Bush and the Club for Growth economic conservative group are realizing Trump's will to endure and are starting to pour their dollars into the stand to bring him down.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's approval rating has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are holding in the early stages.
After a Quinnipiac University poll last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "pleased" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "disgusted" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "excited" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest in the enthusiasm level?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "upset" if the firm's favorite Jeb Bush became the nominee.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as the problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his arrogance and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to the idea that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number are held in the Iowa State Senate Club, the first in the nation where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commanding personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
When asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination, versus 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even as the Republicans rallied around the other candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But Monmouth University polling from early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins the majority.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump voters say they're not going to change their mind.
Obviously, it can change a lot of things, and no one can honestly say that they'll never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for a change of candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even after Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "thugs" in his campaign speech, immigration remains the central conversation piece for 2016.
Some fear Trump's hubris will turn key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage efforts to rebrand.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half the support of Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll Monday say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "hell of a rage".
The House has backed a bigger share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies, on first reading, supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from the mining companies' fees for brown coal surface mining.
Minister Jan Mládek (CSSD) promised the deputies that this would bring extra money to both the state treasury and the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget. The House of Representatives in the first reading supported the government's amendment to the Higher Law, which among other things means that the state should receive a larger share of the revenue from the surface mining fees of brown coal from mining companies.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the municipalities' share will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The Act also changes the way the mining companies are paid for the minerals they extract.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring in an additional CZK 427 million to the state coffers compared to 2013.
The government claims that the tax is to have a neutral impact on the revenues of the municipal budgets, as the fee is to be higher.
Last year, municipalities received around 450 million kroner from the fees and the state budget 150 million kroner.
The municipality received about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns from brown coal mining.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the mining levy to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the deputies that the municipality would receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns per year instead.
The amount of the mining fee is no longer determined by law, but is determined by the government by its decree.
The compensation is recalculated as the product of the quantity of ore extracted and the rates for each type of ore.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee by a government decree may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, there is no tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
The fees are only paid to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money goes to the municipality and one quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be true for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money collected by the State from the mining levies will be earmarked.
For example, 28% will have to go to repairing after-dust or to provide mine rescue services.
The bill was criticised by opposition MPs who argued that it would harm both the affected communities and the counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they do now, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to get the finance minister to improve the budget", said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in the Ústí region.
The KSCM member Hana Aulická warned of the increase in unemployment in the city of Mostec.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Kučera wanted the bill returned to the government for completion.
The reasoning report states that according to the mining companies the fee increase will not be passed on to the coal price because the price is more than 90% long-term.
Major consumers such as power or district heating plants should therefore not feel the price increase.
'On the other hand, this increases the risk that the extractive organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by seeking to reduce their operational costs, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees', the Government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in charges is tolerable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milana Urbana (Czech Republic), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is passed.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, it will have an impact on the revenues of the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall only after 2020.
The limitations on the bottom of the CSA should be broken down for social, national economic reasons and for the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Cheery will lead the Czechs as number one, deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the table of the Davis Cup draw in India on Thursday and this time each of them will probably intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the load to the whole quartet due to the difficult conditions.
With the heat and humidity in Delhi, expect tough fights that can last up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out by the weather.
And depending on how it looks, he said he's back at today's Czech selection practice at the center of Raje Kumar Khany.
With the number one team and the top 40 in the world, George Merry counts down to Friday's and Sunday's doubles.
The two-man position is probably filled by Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like to get almost everyone involved.
I've got the slow-motion in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's foursome.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to the seasoned douchebag who's 18-4 in the four-way Davis Cup.
It's not likely to be cheery.
That leaves the options with Rosol or Adam Pavlas.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look", said Navalet.
It's decided by the outcome of the two games.
The variant is Pavlásek, who was pleasantly surprised in the first round by winning the doubles against Australia.
"He's a hell of a decent one", he said back.
I did that against Australia, and if I'm playing, I'd like to show the same performance I showed there from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to bring the point home", said Pavlosek.
The home team will play Yuki Bhambri, who won the last week's Challenger in Shanghai, beating the third and fourth-ranked players.
The second one will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
Both of them are challengers, and our guys have experience on the ATP Tour, but we've seen many times that the Davis Cup rankings don't really matter.
"The momentary form, the weather, will decide", said the returning.
Friday's opening doubles will begin at 6:30 A.M. and may be delayed due to weather.
The weather forecast says it's gonna rain and Kurt's not under the roof.
However, it may be played under artificial lighting.
They've already fused it and it's got some two thousand lux, which is plenty.
"It should be allowed to play under the lights", he replied.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut on Prime Minister's Questions.
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQ has been highly anticipated.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut on Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time will be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be closely scrutinized by the media and MPs.
In his weekly statement, he called for "less drama and more facts".
He also stated that he might skip a few sessions, which he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, coming after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech to the annual TUC congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem in the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several headline stories.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn's top team, citing differences in the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of parliamentary parties originally supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences at work are also "growing" after Mr Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's benefit cap.
Mr. Corbyl told the TUC conference that the Labor Party had put forward amendments to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, said the party was "very clearly" opposed to the government's plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the last decade since he was elected leader of the Conservatives.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims he has ideas "out of the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQs are too confrontational and that they abstain from both "ready answers" and "tooth-in-the-mouth" and instead promise to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Trade Secretary, will represent him at PMQ when she's not attending - as, for example, when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, as he was rumoured to have discussed the matter with Speaker of the House John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with the PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgement, their leadership of the House and their standing among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and need far-reaching reforms.
"Shoes in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn something and earn a living.
I Was Shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of this project.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
Libra jumped the next day, showing a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led upwards by SABMiller's bid target.
Between May and June, GB's earnings, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like the estimates were coming in when the rates would go up.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after getting a bid from rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures are above expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn using a joint placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi packaging and paper group's stock was the biggest drop in the index, dropping 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating to "for sale".
JD Sports up 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in half-year pre-tax profits of £46.6m.
JD Sports' boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it's unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh higher wage costs in his firm, he says.
The costs could be affected by JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague apartment building are cheering.
The controversial building has been hit by a lightning bolt.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
A petition was launched against the building, which is to be built in the immediate vicinity of the Anežský monastery in the center of Prague.
The Magistrate's decision stated that there was a violation of the Building Code because all the requirements of the zoning ordinance were not met.
'The zoning decision in question does not contain certain details, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the shape of the building described in a sufficiently clear and comprehensible way, the delimitation of the area affected by the construction,' the decision states.
The Magistrates' Court also considers that it is unlawful for certain documents to be issued in relation to the documentation originally under consideration, which has been changed.
For example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the National Gallery's property, but the investor doesn't have the National Gallery's valid approval.
However, the files show that the land owner only agreed to the project documentation for the land management, not the agreement to the placement of the construction on his land, writes the Department of Building Code.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta, from the investment firm, the building code department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority, the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the opening of the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned", Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which is nicknamed the marshmelon because of the colour of the façade, is provoking strong emotions in Prague.
In the past, hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre to protest the construction.
The association and residents of nearby homes complain that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Anežský Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project has been changed several times.
The original version of the project from 2008, which included a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monuments Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the permit of the Prague Monuments Commissioners in 2010.
The new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with facial windows was approved by both the NPÚ and the city authorities and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the design rejects the criticism of opponents, saying that he never counted on a facade in pink, which gave the project the nickname of the pink and white sugar cane.
A Czech politician has been transporting migrants.
Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees in a car, and they said they were going to drive them about a half a kilometer.
At that time, he said, it was not a crime in Hungary, he told the newspaper Liddish.
We knew that law enforcement officers would not tolerate such behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise we were arrested and taken to the interrogation detention center in Szeged, he described the letter.
He ended up spending nine hours in the police cell.
The police were said to be well behaved, but they had difficulty communicating because they did not speak English well.
But he said prison was sad.
For example, our ten-by-five-foot [three by four meters] cell was crammed with 15 Syrian refugees.
There was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
The people had been locked up for two days and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg said.

Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's assault in South and Western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are joining brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware retailer will celebrate its annual investor strategy day.
There's a lot at stake, because South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's business moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, taking sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western Australia over the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and USD 600 million in each market.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost him about $13 million in pre-tax revenue, Mr. Kierath confirmed.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash food sales to decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share to decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the chief fund manager of Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely become extinct within a decade.
Metcash has declined to publicly comment on Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and revenues from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of the change to speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has taken a counter-attack, investing over $150 million a year to match counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA retailers re-equip their stores with fast-growing food and novelties from private vendors.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says the price-matching and store-fitting programs are catching up and hopes wholesale will return to basic profit-to-earnings growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves more glory than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the latest casualty in the recent uproar surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks", drew unwelcome attention for his affair with the notorious Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and rival Ryan Harrison had to be refereeed twice separately, with Harrison declaring, "Wawrinka should have given one to Kyrgios and I should have given him one".
While last seen breaking his own racket after a cramp ended his chances of beating Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis was unwavering in his defense of Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a place in the second round behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely that in my opinion Thanasi was a little bit caught up in the whole controversy", Healy recalls.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost to a cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to vent his anger on his rocket out of frustration with himself.
But he really did manage to do very well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old male, he works very hard and fits in very well with the team and so on, he's never had any problems with the other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young lad, and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgiose due to the important match starting on Friday, stating that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but encourages the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around him", says Healy.
And I think Nick has been moving very quickly, as Federer and Murray and other people have pointed out, and he's growing very quickly in the public eye, and he's made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism that he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time away from the screen, when he can think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and also for him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the declaration of a state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining those who attempted to cross it illegally to stop the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled into no-man's-land and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who are stuck for an indefinite period of time in the strip of land between two states are those who flee violence in their home countries, build tents and settle.
But there are frustrations.
As the helicopter flies overhead, the migrants shout "Open the borders!" and abuse the security forces of the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
The Serbian foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" that refugees were being sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect nuisance.
In the coming days, discussions with Brussels and other countries will be necessary", says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in stunned Italy and Greece, and spoke of the hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or later in the year that would see EU nations take in over 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called for a special EU summit next week to discuss the continent's refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes in Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country, now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to draw the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major vulnerability and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them were economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees seeking protection, a view clearly different from that of other EU states, including Germany.
New laws that went into effect at midnight in Hungary now criminalize breaking the 4-meter fence that the government has erected on the southern border with Serbia, and also provide longer prison terms for those who smuggle refugees.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We're clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said that authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught on state territory.
They broke through the fence and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed wire covered tow truck.
At the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos ensued as Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal processing container and a crowd of people began to gather.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands of them got left out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders is cut in half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is closing in on her lead.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce his candidacy for president, is gaining the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
With more than five months to go before the primary, some of the most democratic voters say it's too early to say they're clear on which candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained ground in several.
Clinton maintains a big lead among women and is easing, but her lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has declined dramatically, and Sanders is only down 5 points.
The Clinton advantage with the Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated and now they're tied with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is trailing her by only 5 points in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
It's probably no surprise that the current Clinton supporters are particularly passionate about her.
Opinions are mixed among those who currently disapprove of Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would happily support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When asked in an open question why Clinton supporters want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the belief that it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Further, there is a high degree of choice and agreement on the issues.
While the vice president is considering a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to lead the way - a third think he shouldn't run.
When asked in the Democratic primary who they would choose as their second choice for the party nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead will expand from 20 points when Biden is running to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is second by a long way on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely candidate is rising.
However, when it comes to the issue of a candidate's greater importance, Democratic voters prefer problem-solving over greater chance of being elected.
As was the case last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate is making an unwelcome appearance to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, are doing well in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads all three in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest or trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think he's honest or trustworthy.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as aligned with their ideological view.
On all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to arise over Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the issue and say it has not affected their overall view of it at all.
But with the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was divided as early as March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say that this email controversy has no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their opinion of Clinton has declined.
And while Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy by voters in her party, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But Clinton and Trump both have good leadership scores.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush led the way in honesty.
Sanders is seen more as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't have an opinion on him.
The margin of error in a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates account for half the voters in the latest poll and let the others seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a landslide, climbing from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson's shot up from 6 to 23 percent in the same time period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and outperforming Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio State Governor John Kasich, is behind, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is all but out of the 10% support, down to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all tied for third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improving to 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's upward trend, Trump has decided to take a blind shot at the retired neurosurgeon, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died during a fraternal overweight ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of the Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity of New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening of a ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his admission to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, had a backpack full of sand totaling 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his goal through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Fraternity failed to call 911 immediately after Deng collapsed, and allegedly waited an hour before transporting him to the hospital, police say.
However, they did find time to put on Deng's clothes, googled his symptoms and contacted Andy Menga, the fraternity's national president, to ask his advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide equipment and essentially put the welfare of the fraternity before the life of Michael Deng", Chief Wagner said.
They were unable to resuscitate him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with blunt objects in the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternity overwork, and at least one student has died every year from overwork since 1970", Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, wrote in a statement.
The fraternity and its members must be held accountable and this step is important from the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assault with a deadly weapon and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only the people involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity severed its relationship with the local chapters.
This happens when the Fed raises interest rates
The rate of growth will come and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna last.
For economics specifically, the history of small origins offers a timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, determinant in how the economy and financial assets will react.
That's why Fed officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hike starts, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market participants can rest assured that all the noise about speed increases may be exaggerated.
"The first Fed hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' era", Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more normal but still low level to create the seismic shock that many would fear.
That means there will be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has been experiencing over the last month or so, the expected rate hike may make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for stocks to re-stall 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market has often been most likely - about 14 percent - to go into a relatively flat 250-day rate increase (averaging a 2.6 percent increase), and then return to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron's.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the rate-raising cycle and returns are starting to decline.
Recessions are a fact of life, but rising interest rates often help.
Now, the Fed is facing some conditions that haven't existed before that could precipitate a recession.
Most notable is that gross domestic product is near its lowest point in history in raising the Fed's rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal annual GDP growth been below 4.5 percent.
Although it was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to hold up, when it was just 1.5% in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising rates in this difficult economic environment could be risky and could raise the question of 'if this time is different', Deutsche said.
Market participants have been preparing for the Fed's rise for a year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, since 1950, all the upward cycles have been in a super cycle of leverage upward with GDP covering the peaks at the beginning of the recession very quickly after the recovery begins", says the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're at 74 months and we're still going.
The fixed return was also volatile, as the market expects a rate hike and the pattern is somewhat similar to that experienced by equities.
The main difference is that the impact is more readily apparent in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes its policy direction.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first up-down cycle arrives.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields decline immediately", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate increase will bring the yields between long- and short-dated bonds closer together, smoothing out the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, though "we're still cautious about stretching yield", said Kathy Jones, a senior fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets are already aligned with the Fed's policy expectations.
"Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightening policy.
Generally speaking, firms that do most of their business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will do worse because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the 'quality' of stocks tends to overtake within three months of an initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in each rate increase in 1994, 1999, and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a big problem.
Companies with high percentage floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond the pure action game, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers may also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have differing opinions on how long this will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the station for "dumbing down"
It is argued that it is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating the British
Congressman Damien Collins has attacked the Voice and says he is not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claims leading MP, and is piling fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove they are doing something that commercial broadcasters are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's bosses that the public service broadcaster seems to be "dumbed out" and increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word 'dumbed down' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM", he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seems to be taking the British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind where you're just mimicking what we have in the market", Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general rejected the accusation, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to live and make music is really top-notch.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and put new works into operation is very important", he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's controller Alan Davey argued that we now need to work harder to engage audiences than we have in the past because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC production to come under fire for trampling on business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and to come before the committee.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
You see why this program is being discussed as being unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in a "typical BBC way".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending the money of the licence fee payers on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at their slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame.
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000
Online sales were boosted three years ago by mobile shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could be the reason for the curb on spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and it has turned many of Britain's main streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of a stabilization of online sales, with new figures showing a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the start of measurements in 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of a rebound in online sales, with new data showing a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it's always been rationalized over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explains that Internet sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
What that meant was that people were able to buy online and they were able to make purchases in different contexts, like on the couch.
Now it's stagnating a bit, and therefore it seems to be receding.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that consumers may be reluctant to shop ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times as many shoppers as the average turned to their computers to make purchases, and they were able to browse multiple retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows shoppers to re-sell, may deter customers from further purchases.
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the crane crash in Mecca and the family of Bin Laden was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims performing the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane fall in the Grand Mosque of Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims through the streets.
Dressed somewhat in white, the mourners made their way and paid tribute to the victims as the first of the fallen made their final journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaissem.
A sad message passed by the holy site where just days earlier a construction crane had broken through the roof of the mosque and crashed into the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 people who died after a crane fell on the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father of four, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will take place, and thousands continue to descend on the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group shouldn't have left the arm of the crane up when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, says that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The UK record company didn't report this detail, but said the company's executives were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused a crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims converge before the Hajj later this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued any statement on the collapse of the crane and no representatives have been made available for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest safety measures, and of failing to coordinate with weather officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, running major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade whose family was disowned in the 1990s.
The crash occurred amidst high winds and rain just days before millions of people in the kingdom arrived for the pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must undergo at least once in their lives.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be given to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q's boss says Eastern European traders working for cheap money are no longer the trend
The UK is increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained Eastern European traders is behind the growth point
The result is 200 Screwfix stores open for merchants
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country.
It was edited by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be laying down their hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed, trained Eastern European craftsmen to work in their homes.
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, it looks like you're in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do their home-made crafts, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a home supply chain, argues that the huge increase in trained Eastern European retailers offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer the trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting merchants, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by better halves.
Today, most of the workers are men.
She said there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more female households doing more home improvements than in the past.
"We still have a male-dominated workforce", says Laura.
We need to get closer to the balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, making 80% of our purchasing decisions.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading firms in the UK's FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the parity between male and female CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the female representation among its employees, including the CFO and the CFO.
Mrs Laury says: 'It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a collapse in profits in the middle of the year and a sell-off after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
The trend is for Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, to open 200 new stores
The 600 crowns of the pensioners' allowance is in danger.
"It's the justice of straight bellies, it has nothing to do with human justice", said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasised the principle of merit.
The chairman of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura MPs noted that the one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in the standard valuation, because it would be projected into the next years.
"We have the space to find a mechanism to do this", Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (CSSD), according to which it was to be valorized next year beyond the framework of the law.
The Commission has defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which it considers to be not a rosy one.
Higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valuation had decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM), pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and beyond.
The veto would complicate and possibly even prevent the December payroll, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed a shortened deadline for the discussion of the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, which was also blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be worth a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, the average pension should increase by about 100 crowns.
The contribution should be paid to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December, according to the pension amendment.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension rights before they were paid in December.
But they would have to ask for the bonus in writing, and no later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly revalued by January, by price increases and by a third of the increase in real wages.
This year, the pension is equivalent to 41.5 percent of gross pay, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, according to the state's final accounts, which was about five billion more than in the previous year.
The old-age pension expenditure represented 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension rose last year by 104 to 10,714 crowns, according to the National Accounts.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 pro rata pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned his political career plans and will devote himself to science.
The billionaire's Senate seat was virtually guaranteed, according to Russian media.
He was to represent the West Russian region of Kaliningrad in the Federation Council, whose governor Nikolai Chukanov, as the candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his position in Sunday's elections with a resounding victory.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from among three candidates whose names are announced before the gubernatorial election.
After the election, he chooses the senator from the three candidates.
A complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by law.
The Kremlin did find an exception for Yakunin, as he is an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, not subject to the legal long-term residency requirement.
The shooting of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger has ended.
The final straw in the protagonist's resolve is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has lost his strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janjurova decided on grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
Jan is aware that he and his wife, Olga-Elika Balzer, are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, and he wants to live in dignity and freedom again.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from what he has been, he added to the story of the Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to use comedy to capture a certain type of relationship where one partner doesn't feel completely free.
He said it was clear from the beginning that the lead role would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already worked on the series Invisible.
Still, he said he was surprised by the actor's appearance on camera after a long hiatus from his recovery from a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him the script to read and he said he liked how sad it was.
And to my surprise, he's obviously a covert athlete.
Because he used to ask me where he was going to sit before he shot the next scene.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even walked up a hill.
And all in record-breaking tropical heat, the director noted.
Bartoška says women marry tigers to make rabbits of them.
They pour some food on him, but they close the gate so he doesn't think about playing tiger outside the rabbit-hole.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor said.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was played by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic, and well-meaning.
But she is also a usurper and wants to roast her husband to death, Bajgar pointed out.
The film also tells the parallels of the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the sons-in-law of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben of Logline Production, a co-production of Czech Television and Rozhlas and TV Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, the US internet company, has pledged to give up to $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday on Google.org, the charity arm of the Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of Telicka's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP Pavel Telička postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday after the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
Baku, according to Telicka, justifies this with last week's EP resolution criticizing human rights violations in Azerbaijan, which Telicka co-authored.
Telicka was deprived of the opportunity to hold talks with official partners and visit political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
The trip, which was planned several months in advance, was intended to be used by Telička to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent by ČTK states.
The resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent sentencing of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadizho Ismail, who campaigned to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky, during his visit to Novosibirski, did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have any plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he declared.
Russia has an old naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus, which has been used as a service and logistics centre.
However, according to Russian press reports, since the beginning of August, Russian arms and military equipment shipments to Syria have increased.
Moscow claims that these are arms shipments resulting from existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar Assad for now.
But Washington is not clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, according to US commentators.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on the situation in Syria with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday, their third phone call in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to address concerns over the build-up of Russian arsenals near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad a losing bet.
He said that the goals of Russia's policy in Syria were rather unclear.
He says Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It could mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a longer-term goal, but what that goal is, Earnest says, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York, according to speculation in the Russian press today.
On the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas, the Russian leader, on the contrary, does not want to talk at all.
According to a report in The New York Times today, the U.S. government is not ruling out that President Barack Obama and the Russian president may meet during a U.N. meeting.
But the White House advisers are divided.
TASS today quoting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said that Putin's schedule for his New York trip does not include a meeting with Obama.
Sesame oil is good for the gallbladder diet, hemp helps boost the immune system.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
Cold pressing of the seeds will leave all the healthy substances in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of healthy diets, such as dialysis.
Some extra virgin oils are good for preventing cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, for several years now, these are the most common causes of death among Czechs.
Gastroenteritis is a woman's problem, but sesame oil helps.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you will not want to miss sesame oil, which is a part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can be used in the heat-treatment of food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It's often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are good for preventing gallstones.
They cause 90% of the cases of gallbladder infections, and women suffer from these problems three times more often than men.
Generally, gallbladder problems are more common in people who are overweight, who do not exercise, and who eat a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be used successfully with a liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder diet.
If people want to enjoy the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should beware of items sold in exotic food stores.
Asian manufacturers often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more distinctive taste.
But the oil loses all its active ingredients, said Ladislav Hačecký, the executive director of Bohemia Olej, a Czech company in Kraslice, Sokolovsk, that produces cold pressed bio-virgin oils.
The company is also making sesame oil, using only unroasted white sesame seeds.
In one hour, our fox can slice off eight kilos of sesame.
The raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees by mechanical pressing, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation 'extra virgin'.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil is good for heart and vascular disease.
The Czech's favorite oil is sunflower.
A survey conducted by Jarmila Hamerská at Masaryk University showed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
But it's not really good for frying, and it starts to burn up at 180 degrees.
It is better used for flavoring salads, for example, and is particularly suited to dietary intake, where it helps prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 monounsaturated fatty acids, which are the most cholesterol-lowering of all fatty acids.
When you have heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of total fat and calories you eat.
For example, one tablespoon of sunflower oil has 62 calories, and one tablespoon of rapeseed oil has 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They're part of the processed products.
That's why it's a good idea to go for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the sesame and hemp will for nine months.
Storage in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life.
The old oil is known by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no black mark on the bottom of the fault.
It's a sign that the substance hasn't been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Because the seeds of industrial hemp are considered a superfood, hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained from the diet.
The intake of omega-3 fatty acids is especially important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is a good dietary supplement to support immunity and wound healing.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using hemp oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that Bohemia Olej is one of the best-selling products in the company.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not a flavorful oil, but it is a great immune booster, advised Daniel Vlček of the Bohemia Olej company in Karlsruhe.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecuers is Americans.
That's 1.4 grills per household there.
Around the world, there are various barbecue competitions that testify to the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people never grill.
And the vast majority of them barbecue a few times a year.
To make a successful grill, we must not underestimate the preparation - ideally, the meat should be marinated a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is best suited to this purpose and at the same time leaves behind health-promoting substances during the barbecue?
In general, the grilling process itself should be fat-saving.
Experts agree that a large proportion of oils begin to lose their flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also deprive the body of the beneficial substances that we otherwise obtain from them by consuming oils from foods processed at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean that extra virgin oils don't have their uses in barbecues.
Rice oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When they say "meat", the experts at Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovsk immediately think of grape oil.
It is a wonderful complement to the flavour of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it has the unique ability to enhance the natural flavor of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures, it is one of the few oils that retains its health-promoting properties, says Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid, which makes it effective in controlling excess cholesterol.
Grape oil also provides our bodies with essential monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.
Its beneficial content helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to enhance our outward beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used to treat acne, and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs are touting the use of grape oil in cooking.
It is not only suitable for preparing cold dishes, such as salad seasoning, but also for heat-treating dishes.
So, there are two ways to use barbecue, marinating and barbecuing.
Marinating meat and fish preserves their juiciness.
The marinade must be prepared with three ingredients: oil, acidity and spices.
We add the acidity with apple cider, for example, and we get the meat softened.
The spice adds flavor to the meat, and the oil preserves and provides the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
He adds that grapeseed oil is ideal for marinating because it's one of the few oils that can penetrate dark meat.
So, the marinated meat or fish is ready for grilling, what's the next step?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare dishes.
Same goes for the barbecue.
Some oils are completely off-limits to this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oils, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, spray the grill with oil to prevent food from catching fire.
The preparation of side dishes is also an essential part of the barbecue.
Grilled meat and fish can be served with just about anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a light vegetable salad, and many others.
The chefs at Bohemia Olej recommend the Hot Summer salad, for example.
To make it, you need: • 1 tablespoon of peach • 1 bundle of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaf mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a handful of chopped cucumbers and a large cube of chopped peach to the mixture of salad leaves.
To taste the salt and pepper, you can also flavor it with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle a few drops of grape oil.
For a special taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just the medication that matters, it's the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease, and a person diagnosed with it needs the care of a variety of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, and many other specialists.
It is not just medical care, however, for example, that women with MS need to be consulted if they decide to have a child, and care for these patients includes social legal advice, advice on housing adjustments, etc.
However, this is not enough: the course of the disease can be influenced in a major way by the patient.
The more actively he fights the disease, the longer he can work and the more he does not have to make fundamental changes in his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick leaves room for the activity of the disease.
For example, regular exercise has been shown to significantly delay the time when a sufferer needs a compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It's important that patients and those around them don't fall prey to myths, such as that the disease automatically leads to a wheelchair.
This is why the Give Yourself a Chance website (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing Give Yourself a Chance media campaign.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the earlier the disease is treated, the more likely the doctor is to have an influence.
It's because we have drugs for MS in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the better the chance we have of stopping the disease and delaying disability, explains Dr Eva Medová, from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with MS, which most often addresses weakness in the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, to improve gait, to strengthen the pelvic floor, to reduce swallowing disorders, or to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient", says Dr. Martina Kövári, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motolä.
People with MS suffer from the same disease, but the symptoms vary slightly.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the body's immune system, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another benefit of regular exercise is that it helps patients to see what they can do, and it builds their self-confidence.
"Exercise also releases endorphins and makes you feel good", notes Dr. Kamla Rassova of the Rehabilitation Clinic at the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By affecting the physical side, we affect the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We're directly intervening in the psyche and the immune system, stabilizing the disease, he says.
"In the past, these patients were so-called 'saved', but now we know that they need a targeted load", says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the University Hospital in Motola.
The goal of physical therapy is to help you remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including employment.
Physical therapists therefore work with occupational therapists to provide each person with a compensatory device tailored to his or her needs.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a tough situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shocked.
They're going through shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to the great burden of health loss.
With a soul this sick, we should go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to reach the conclusion that disability is not the end of life, and that MS is not the end of life", says psychotherapist Renata Malinová-Schubertová of the Neurological Clinic of the Faculty of General Medicine in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the airbuses would not fly.
Aircraft manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New airplanes are full of titanium or lightweight, hard-wearing composite materials that no one can make and process right away.
Yet, next to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for forming composites, you come across something as ordinary as a melon pick.
In a drum that resembles a cotton-cotton pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are crushed in a pile of pans.
"No one has come up with anything better", smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the Czech Republic's Latecoere air door manufacturer.
At the Prague-based Letňany factory, the former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They're the only company in the world that makes doors for the Embraer 170 in Brazil.
The doors, part of which is being assembled in Prague, also allow first- and upper-class passengers to enter the upper decks of the world's largest commercial aircraft, the Airbus A380.
They also install doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision is the motto here.
Like the momentum wrench that the company has to reset twice a year.
If the yellow sticker is missing, the Prague factory would have to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing who regularly check whether the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not yet completely replaced human senses.
There are 1,500 bolts on one of the A320 doors.
The reaper has to break it by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even the sound of the hammer falling tells them if the net is already properly untied.
The tolerance they're moving in is minimal.
The net can project from zero to 0.13 millimetres above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
A trained touch is needed for the check.
When the controller passes his finger over a row of strings, he can tell if any are outside the tolerance.
Then he'll take the accurate deflection gauge.
He was the commander of the L-39 military training aircraft program.
But by 1991, not one was made.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
It was then that she teamed up with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
Winning the tender for the supplier of emergency doors for the A321 model.
The negotiations with Boeing were not so happy.
"We were a small company to them at the time, with not enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable supplies", recalls Dubský.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained closed if Letov had not attracted the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Association of the Aerospace Industry in 1999.
I was talking about our partnership with Airbus.
The next day, the French were in talks, Dubsky says.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new contracts.
In 2000, the assembly of the A320 door parts began.
Three years later, the A380's upper deck doors were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of delivery for 20 or 30 years, explains Dubsky.
Last year, Czech Latecoere had a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
Exclusive status among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague has invested 1.5 billion crowns since 2000.
The firm must have quality certificates, certifications of 170 specific production processes and certificates of qualification for key personnel.
Without them, the company would not have produced any airplane doors.
Getting certificates that the manufacturing processes meet customer requirements and maintaining them in repeated inspections costs Dubský millions of crowns.
Manufacturing processes change every year.
They're more precise and more rigorous.
We need to train the staff, retrofit the equipment and re-certify the whole process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is finalizing the preparation of a zinc-nickel plating process that will replace the existing cadmium, which is harmful to human health.
They got the assignment from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The Boeing people are coming, they're gonna check the whole line's design.
Then we'll show them the production.
They're gonna check out our lab.
They test one set of samples themselves in their lab, and then compare the results with ours, and Dubsky is kind of the way that the recipients check them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant, the production of embracers is now up and down.
The A320 produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
But that does not mean that he can get any price behind the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It tells you how much one door will cost in ten, fifty, six pieces.
The price per unit keeps dropping to a certain threshold.
We have to get into this price pattern.
If not, we'll lose, says Dubský.
Half the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400M military aircraft are being completed, is empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
Behind the fence, a new semi-robotic line is being built here for the new A320 Neo model.
The sails are speeding up and getting more accurate.
"This is the trend of the assembly line in aviation", adds Dubský.
The future of the line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3,278 of the new A320 so far.
Just a few metres away, a line will be set up to complete the A380 upper deck door assembly.
It's a strategic decision by our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, Dubsky says.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests, such as for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices in doors for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further develop its production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit to the company that they can handle composites as well as metal materials", says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is at the edge of its production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place in the Letov compound where he's staying.
Before the French mother joined, the company had 180 employees.
Now it's 800, and in three years it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing can outrun the hundreds of new planes that airlines order every year, they don't have to worry about jobs.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere was facing the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay back the loans in September.
Finally, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she exchanged some of their loans for shares.
The creditors acquired a 37,4% stake in the company by increasing its capital by EUR 57,4 million.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, to €180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed new shares for EUR 222,9 million to existing shareholders.
In total, it increased its share capital by EUR 280 million.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85% of sales.
It expects average order growth of 4% per year until 2017.
It has orders in the order book for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
French media says Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the tip of a hat.
The Czech plant in Letňany in Prague is important for the groups.
It contributes 16% to the group's turnover.
It is the largest foreign branch of the group in terms of number of employees.
MPs have backed a bigger share of coal taxes for the state.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring in 427 million crowns more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the Government, the revenue from the municipal budget is to be neutrally affected, as the fee is to be higher.
Last year, municipalities received about 450 million crowns from the fees and the state budget 150 million crowns.
The municipality received about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns from the brown coal mining.
The amendment also increases the fee for land acquisition with permitted mining to 1,000 krona per hectare per year.
The revenue from these reimbursements is to remain the property of the municipalities in full.
Industry Minister Jan Mladek (ČSSD) told the MPs that the municipalities would receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be set by the government by its decree.
The compensation is recalculated as a product of the amount of ore extracted and the rates for each type of ore.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by government decree may not be constitutional.
According to Minister Mládek, however, there is no tax in this case, because the state charges the minerals, which are state property.
The fees are only paid to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the extraction.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money goes to the municipality and one quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be true for the mining of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the State collects from the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repairing damage after mining or to providing mine rescue services.
The bill was criticised by opposition MPs today, who argued it would harm mining communities and counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make the budget better for the Minister of Finance", said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in Ústí Region.
The KSČM member Hana Aulická warned of an increase in unemployment in Mostyc.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the amendment to be rejected, Kučera wanted the law to return the government to the working class.
The reasoning states that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are over 90% long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heat plants should not experience price increases.
'On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in compensation by reducing their operating costs, which would mainly involve a reduction in the number of employees,' the Government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in the employment charges is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is passed.
If the government goes beyond its limits, it will have repercussions on the revenues of the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak Army's mine should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits on the bottom of ČSA should be broken for social, national economic reasons and for the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time for interest rate decision for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve is set to meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think it will sit idle for a while, keeping interest rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been a year since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero-point situation and start the process of normalising interest rates", says Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has done quite well, and there has been a recovery in the form of trillions of dollars being added to the national accounts and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They warned the markets to be ready for a hike, but circumstances suggest they also see a big chance against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day, his coworker - wrote a note saying he regretted the first murder and wished he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gauthier, Mississippi, say that Lamb, a geography and social studies professor at Delta State University, called 911 Monday morning at about 10:00 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night", and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house who "wouldn't bother anyone", but he was upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't show up.
Lamb also didn't explain why the house was being fired upon.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me.
After leaving a note, Lamb made the 300-mile journey to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, then took his own life.
The dean of the university, William LaForge, said that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was clearly something going on in Mr. Lamb's head.
Despite Monday's claims that Lamb allegedly believed Amy Prentiss was romantically involved with Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" of a love triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was "a great person".
The divorce was 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was a case of the shaken.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Always wanting to help others, Knowles made her voice heard.
Police say Lamb spoke with his relatives Monday and said he "will not go to jail".
When officers caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the school's website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All these things certainly take their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of action for several months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has left the injury in tears and out of action for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could be back in action at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moreno's reckless action in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and required an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture in his leg and is now in hospital".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a kid who comes to Manchester at 18 years old, it's very difficult, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also had his oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he'll play this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself if it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly operation with both feet.
A tweet from Shawa's account says: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my road to recovery starts now and I will come back even stronger".
Manchester United have recorded Luke Shaw's injury in the defeat against PSV.
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, coach of PSV, said: "It was a very bad injury".
When any player leaves the field with an injury like that, everyone is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in Mexico's match against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball going the other way, so it looked like he touched it, but I didn't see a stroke on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better than you do?
This is something every parent knows: When a child loves a book, it doesn't take long for him to learn it almost by heart.
You can't be David Cameron, though.
When asked by a children's schematic provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, a 1971 Dr. Seuss fairy tale.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, I enjoyed reading it to my children because it always had an image or message behind it that I hadn't seen before".
Well, until in the next paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book based on a 2012 movie, adding additional characters and details to fill in the brief original text.
"In the walled town of Thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by granting her wish to see a real tree", is the brief content of a book that chronicles the love object of the unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, the text Cameron provided reads like a synopsis of the movie The Lorax, which is available on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
As an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be familiar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being ravaged by the predatory, tree-hugging industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorax, is a shrunken, moustached creature who "speaks through the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively insignificant PR assignment was given to an assistant who had never read the Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text was most likely from the office of Cameron's supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but he still holds
To play Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but after looking at the team England have selected for this tour, I think it's unlikely that they will repeat the 3-0 defeat they suffered last time in the Test series.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line-up and the collective mind is strong too; they will not carry the scars of 2012 with them, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, though unknown at the Test series level, represents an attacking possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth was dropped from the England squad in the Test series and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lythe is a hard nut to crack for me, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests were against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on performance.
For example, there were no questions about the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because, as I've said before, the players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centuries and Lyth could have extended his series, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will arise.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not exactly 100 percent, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much time a batsman gets to prove himself is a tough one.
Lyth got seven shots, as did Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had a chance at home and away.
The only thing you can complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott his first chance in the Caribbean, despite Lyth being in top form, but that wasted opportunity is history.
Alex Hales comes in, and that's a batter I rate very positively.
He's an X-factor cricketer who we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of did it.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course, all of this will depend on the overall composition of the UAE.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would have another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been floated and I have no qualms about it.
I don't understand why the striker can't hit the ball and this left-handed man has already shown he's a great cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and it doesn't make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tryouts before his debut in 2001.
He made three centuries in a single day and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is coming on as a reserve spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, I was struck by the impressive young man.
People can look at his raw stats - he averages 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and I see that as a springboard, but there aren't a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors have gone for the young.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, it seems England have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches may be a master move.
He's one of the most beautiful guys to play, who brings a wealth of experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming on the white-ball tour and bringing both energy and relentless spark to the team.
I always felt he was born into the world of international cricket, as a player and as a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's Ben Stokes has been given a day off, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their job is to get results.
Decisions like that can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy stagnates by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour Party leadership, or the TUC will take over the whole Europe situation on Tuesday.
The aliens also have their Corbyn and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is sinking into various crises - not all of which are their fault - some member states have had enough of Britain's egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that most did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want to do that even if they were to override social security.
We could even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then go home saying they're winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants an unrecognised Britain in European Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have gotten to the point where they don't care about our leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as it was for the too-long Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande faces reelection or being replaced in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to watch them break their legs in the help of a selfie of Britons who could better invest their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want to do themselves, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the campaign ahead of the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Return to negotiation solves the problem" and "Britain has nothing worth negotiating".
Europeans know, to their own detriment, how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU are the media oligarch barons, because they were not there during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 which voted for our entry in 1973 by a margin of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, the outspoken Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels reporter for EU straight bananas in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-dodging thugs, phone hacking aliens, and the pseudo-overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a gorilla that's gone crazy, you have to throw bananas at it to keep it from eating you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair admitted the principle of the abrogated EU constitution, which was flooded by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him the ticket of expulsion.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in a friendly manner at Westminster on Monday - I told him he could not waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-adopting the boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock of Murdoch, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbyn's official stance on Europe is, I'll put it mildly, evolving.
He says he wants to remain in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the frenzied Ukip tendency and the wild shores of Tory's little Englandism can certainly go for it.
The same thing Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't bring himself to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his grandfather fought for his loyalty on TV without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in any case" - Benn's phrase - was apparently not what McDonnell was saying, nor was it what JC told his colleagues and MPs in their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, whatever the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - and remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in an age of all-day television broadcasting and especially in a faith, paranoia and betrayal hotbed of social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe which would allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell has argued.
Simon Jenkins is definitely thinking that.
But McDonnell's and Corbyn's fundamental distortion of EU membership - in line with their Bennittite-based, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his twist on NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - and they have suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the brisk "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even in cutting the costs of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday's launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the reviews of electronically published by Public Health England
A statement by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, say researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used in their report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released a "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the data's completeness and have pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal The Lancet last month attacked the "extremely flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claim, which was allegedly "built on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They claim that the public might expect that PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on extensive evidence review and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had reportedly previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the Sustainability Report, it said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted to funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not to the funding he allegedly received earlier from Philip Morris International, the tobacco company supplied.
The reason for the panel's selection is not available, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industry funding in the newspaper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The tobacco company also attended the meeting at PHE.
The report produced in this group "expressly admits" the lack of "hard evidence for the harmfulness of most products on most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ claim had been answered before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers will die from their addiction.
All evidence indicates that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting shows like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give a real hand" to hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programmes not produced by other British television broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes that were likely to be watched by only a handful of people into difficult broadcasting times against its rivals' biggest ratings shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to link up with the BBC for the six years he had worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state funding", Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of a debate on the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fees, which I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should reduce the creation of programmes that do not produce or market others.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and of course nonsensical.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a profit.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders is another, and of course, produced in-house.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for it.
I can't understand how these are public service broadcasting.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support".
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more playful public service programmes "move to BBC4 where quite often they can't measure audiences, but they do fulfil their mandate and can argue when they are about to go on their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn in licence fee revenue, "but of course we do all these obscure programmes that nobody watches".
They're broadcasting at times when no one is watching.
As for the royalty, Johnson told the commission: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a lot of money, but for people who are 150 pounds a year, I wonder if they'd pay that much because they don't watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now already classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio - and should take the example of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the topic of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which were only a handful of shows on TV, and link up with commercial reporters so we can all see them online.
Sonogenetics, or the manipulation of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction of the hedgehog's movement.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny spines change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching the cells of genetically engineered motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists say that these worms are a fine example of a new technique called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activate outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are injected into a patient's brain to stimulate the brain, a method used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease, for example.
The ticks do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves that then passed through the worms' bodies.
The amplified ultrasound waves are produced in the TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some worm cells.
The sound waves open these channels and activate the cells with which they are connected, reports the journal Nature Communications.
To control the worms with ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contained TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the worms, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where the modified motor neurons were activated.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
But Chalasani suggested that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent through an optical fiber to a desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases", Chalasani said.
He added that the method could also be used to treat muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements shaming the British arms trade.
Watch a video about the anti-gun market from Amnesty International.
The dreaded killing of the drones!
Leggings that break your ankles!
The three-shot!
And electric stunning rods that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricatured metaphor leaves no doubt that this ad at the world's largest arms fair is a stark parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes through the International Defence and Security Facility at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being run with the creation of posters at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcement, traveling to DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using the font of the London Underground badge with DLR lines becoming the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR... customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute them all over London and through the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which are £6 per Allen key, which allegedly "gain access to roughly a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism".
One of the parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a teaching assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists are moving on to work with activists in protest movements and realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another one of the anti-gun posters greets the passengers on the subway.
The Amnesty video on Facebook was watched by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee and the graphic designer and commentator also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding gun-deal ads - he saw a blank space in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with creating more realistic and risky corporate ads, but "by adding bright colors and animation, we managed to attract more people".
"They did a fantastic job and helped raise our concerns about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair", says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the gun shop comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US Army for "the shoulder-firing AT4CS RS".
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides a stunning effect from behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it is, it's not going to be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for college life
Eleven years ago, I moved into a fraternity as a nonchalant 19-year-old boy, still believing in the beret and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I'd annoyed - and the numerous, protracted complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to college can range from mildly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying.
It's tempting to talk nonsense, tell people where you're from, whether you've taken a year off, what your opinion of Corbyn is, and why "you honestly don't love or even hate Marmite, because, folks, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be in my room".
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask and show interest.
It guides conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't be with if your eyelashes were on fire and they gave off fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and communal public spaces, but they are also rooms where people dress and mend their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts go to college for a short time.
Your room should be a sanctuary, yet many of the tracks are turning into an out-of-the-room-walking culture that's friendly, social, and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It can be hell for someone who needs a recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you gone so I can get back the energy I spent talking to you".
Try to recognize when a classmate is tired of socializing - and perhaps write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One of the boys in my classes used to say that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends with the baking.
Because you started college on the cusp of baking mania, knocking on someone's door and showing up with a plate of baked pies seems a little less weird, less like "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions".
Offering home-cooked meals is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe it'll all end up being a nice surprise.
That's the point of being a decent baker, of course.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and gruel will likely guarantee that others will pretend to be asleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime on college campuses.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Double check with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're raving mad inside.
If someone steals from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy, but try to handle it a little more mature than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwashing liquid to punish the thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noises that distract people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but also about being a celebrity in a glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit because it was 3 o'clock in the morning and she had a paper due in the morning.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally settled down at 5:00 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, and then played her own music loudly, locked the door, and left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife attended the same college as you?
On the other hand, wouldn't it be awfully embarrassing if you mistakenly thought your roommate was your future mate, slept with her, separated her, and had to see her every day, and maybe took control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you don't have to trust your heart - but unless your sexy roommate is 100% your future wife, at least try to talk a little bit about your weaknesses.
In the exhilarating moment when you realize that someone left the key in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about keeping them safe by hiding something - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put their keys in a water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their things on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve had a difficult time even when she was pregnant with the now seven-year-old son, Isaac.
His father had separated from her, and she was left alone to prepare and raise the child.
I was able to cope with the situation fairly quickly - I was very excited about the baby and looked for the positive in it.
I've tried not to worry about the insecurity and the baby being alone.
And I certainly had hopes that we wouldn't be alone for long, as Eva recalls her first pregnancy today.
She had already met the elderly Vashek on the Internet, and they started talking about their favorite movies.
Your father even brought Eva and Vítek home from the maternity hospital, but he didn't play the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while", Eva described in the documentary series Four in the Third.
The theme of the third series of the Czech TV is precisely the search for luck for the second try.
She was able to support Vítek and the family financially thanks to a part-time job and the help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil Vashek's affection for Eva.
They definitely got together around Vítek's second birthday and he now understands Vášek as his father and also addresses him as such.
Although he has two grown daughters, he says he enjoys fatherhood at age 60 and is more involved with his children.
In addition to Vitek, they were joined by a two-year-old Leontinka and eventually by twins.
"The mushroom has come into our family naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked much about relationships", thinks Eva with a smile.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins, Ema and Ela, were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis late in her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant woman and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, usually passing on its own in the mother after childbirth.
And Ela and Ema were born healthy to Eva and Vashko's luck, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emicha was placed in an incubator in the intermediate ward, where Vaska's niece works, who managed to take over and place her.
Elinka was bigger and I had her with me as soon as we got her out of the ICU and into the room, describing the difficult period after Eva's birth.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until doctors agreed to release the baby, who had managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But waiting for the birth of children in the maternity ward brought Eve no joy.
"I was madly homesick for my husband and children", recalls the six-week-old mother of four, as she endured difficult times in the ward.
She and her husband even considered a reverse mortgage, partly because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, though, the doctors were unable to do so, and Eva and the twins were sent to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast on ČT1 on Tuesday evenings at 21:45.
A big family can be quite restrained.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva has had to put up with electrical double screens and cramped conditions.
The house did not get any bigger, but Vácek made Eva happy by installing a gas stove to make cooking for six more convenient.
If it gets too hot, we'll take turns getting a cab.
Eva believes that children perceive the family's comfort and pleasant atmosphere, not the size or clutter of the house.
We've gotten along so well, better than we thought.
Although it is harder to hide a mess in a small space and we sometimes overlap with a toddler, at least we are all close together", smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to any situation.
Your job as a film lighting technician doesn't guarantee a regular income.
That's why he sometimes drives around the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says he's physically able to take care of the family's finances and children, but for how long?
"I realize that because of our age difference, one day I will be the one to provide for this family", admits Eva when asked about the future.
She'd love to go back to work, but she's even more tempted to start her own business.
I'm not exactly a good fit for an employer with four kids.
And if the worst comes to the worst, my husband and I can take turns getting a cab, jokes the nice blonde.
Apple has achieved the yo-yo effect.
It's all the screens.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a more robust chassis, and a touch-screen are just some of the features of the newly introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Because the trend at Apple has been that each new generation of the iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was the third and fourth generations, which gained a slight weight gain over the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the advantages of the news was really negligible.
But that's not the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the smaller model gained 14 grams, while the larger model gained 20 grams.
On the one hand, it's hard to believe that last year's folding in the pockets scandal has hurt Apple so much.
The new chassis is made of the more durable 7000 aluminium alloy, which also reflects the weight.
But the bigger impact on her is the screens.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to make its displays recognize the power of touch.
This required an additional layer of capacitive sensors to be added to the display.
The new iPhones have more than doubled the screen size of previous generations.
The smaller iPhone went from 12 grams to 29 grams, and the larger iPhone went from 19 to 40 grams.
So on the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of just 143 grams is also achieved by the de-thickening shell, which touches most of the remaining components.
The battery is the heaviest component used in the larger model, but its weight has not changed from the predecessor.
Even in this case, the largest increase is seen in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
The extent to which new display technology is practical will be reflected in its use.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go on sale in select countries.
Have the breakfast cereals been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Italy, archaeologists have made a discovery in the Grotta Paglici that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of modern human habitation from different eras, including murals, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which instruments have dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that looks very much like the remains of a breakfast buffet.
The remains of oat grains were found at the site, which apparently went through the process of making the popular cereal today.
The grain is first soaked, then dried, the husk is removed, then the grain is milled and the surface is painted.
Grain was found in the Paglicci Cave, apparently heated or sawed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least that is what the use traces on the two stones in the cave suggest.
Thus, in their publication for PNAS, the scientists could not prove that the cave had a complete process of making the flakes, but the similarity is very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat cereal, but the suggestion that it was with some kind of liquid and quite possibly heat, of course, is offered quite logically.
It's also a very interesting piece of evidence of how people used grain intensively long before agriculture was invented.
Because if the Flakes Interpretation is correct, the earliest Flakes predate agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reports from the Brno Transportation Company.
So I once again listened to the names of the trolleybus stops: Hnusáčekova, The Ghost, Frazova, The Spartan.
Of course, the trolley bus was a little louder, so the male voice was a little less audible than before, when the stops were reported by the female voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so in the deeper traffic noise, she is better recognized than a man's voice is.
The DPMB argues that the voice recorder was selected by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but it was definitely picked from studio recordings made in total silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of a bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a couple of decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who are not familiar with Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can finally, where they went by mistake, then claim that the stop they were supposed to get off at was not reported at all.
Perhaps the selection of the speaker - or better still, the speaker - should be done again, this time with the usual traffic noise and engine noise, where the bus speaker's hum is almost lost.
So we wouldn't have to listen to the names of the stations Water Hershpice, Smirov, or Dive in the creaking sack that I switched to in Komárová.
I suppose my old hearing didn't suddenly deteriorate so much during that one day when the speaker changed stops.
I understood the message quite well before that day.
Good morning, comrade chief. How are you?
From the track records.
Few people today know that under the Party, the biggest and the smartest were the so-called complex checks.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was late.
I rushed into the dispatcher's office the second the radio said it was 7:00 a.m.
"You're lucky you didn't bump into Comrade Chief, he came a minute before you and doesn't seem to be in the mood", the dispatcher remarked as I entered my arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm going to the precincts to check out some minor mechanics.
I can't do that. It's the day of the exam.
Everybody's pissed off, they're scared shitless.
What is it?
"You'll see", the dispatcher whispered.
Next time you will be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door of the chief's office opened, and the chief appeared.
"Stiff, with a stone face, in perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief", I greeted respectfully, and quickly buttoned two buttons on my uniform.
"Good morning", came the reply, and I rushed upstairs, not realizing the cold, sinister tone in which the old man had responded.
"You're playing", greeted me Eva, an engineer, an elderly woman whom I respected very much.
She was even a headmistress before the comrades deposed her.
There's a check, and you're gonna hit the back.
I've asked what complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they only come once every three years, they have to go to them all the time, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled out a file of periodic reports and a phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me at once", said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing"... I muttered, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I came at your command", I said, barely entering the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at his desk, looking through some ledgers.
"Comrade Mechanic", he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully examining the ledger, "I don't like your behaviour at all".
He threw the paper away on the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, angry, prickly look.
I was confused.
What's the matter?
Just yesterday, the deputy was bragging about how I'd done a very good job in the last few months and how he was very pleased with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
You realize you're a track-distance technician, and you have to act like it.
The greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I realized that I had been using that greeting since I was a child, that I had been raised to do so, and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red coat on a turkey.
"You're on a socialist railroad and the only acceptable greeting is a good job", said the overzealous chief.
And besides, you're still getting the word out to the higher-ups.
You say "sir" once and "comrade" twice.
But I'm not a chief to you, but a comrade chief.
The deputies are comrades deputies, the chief conductors are comrades chief conductors!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... comrade chief, but... but I greeted you with a normal civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that. It's not the work or the comrade. I'm not in the party.
"It's not your prerogative not to be in the party", coldly said the chief, who had calmed down a bit.
But it's still going to be talked about.
Anyway, remember, you don't have an advance pension up here.
That wasn't good.
When a chief told someone that something was not his prerogative, it did not look good.
For a moment, he poked me with a cold, piercing look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his high-pitched tapping.
He was only a few years older and he was playing God, or rather, a comrade.
Jovial, pompous, authoritarian, arrogant, as it was his moment.
Everybody was yelling at him.
Well, he's the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, as with all party members and non-partisans, was ticking.
But the chief was a bully to many, especially those he could use his superiority over.
He just called me a complete and total piece of shit.
I was thinking about ass, and it took me a long time not to shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn't go back to the potato picket, much less be a railroad clerk.
How am I gonna feed two kids?
And a house built on top of it!
I was in a daze, but I got it together.
I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction.
"That's all for now, you may go", the chief concluded the audience, and began again to scrutinize the ledger he had previously held in his hand.
At half past twelve, I was summoned.
Everyone from the office was already there, and when I asked them what and how, they said, "Yeah, it's gonna be good".
Only Jozhin said, as was his custom, that they can't throw us all out because the work would have to be done by Comrade Chief himself with his loyalists, and that there was no danger.
He said "comrade" as if he knew what the old man was doing to me this morning.
It was a nice gathering in the principal's office.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long table of the council other comrades who were to decide whether I was official or not.
The HR manager, the chairman of ROH, the personnel clerk, the special purpose referent, the kind of military counter, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
A common railway worker, he picked up the rail or threw the gravel with the forks.
But also a former guard.
Rumor had it he was a pretty bad guy back then, a pretty beast.
Bad tongues said he left school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, knew nothing.
And when the penal code was abolished, he ended up in the potato factory.
But comrade, comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul inside me, a small, unbreakable lump in my throat.
The cadres have read the report of the civic committee of the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little bit better.
Then the opinion of the party's street organization.
He was copying the opinion of the Citizens' Committee, maybe they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-time party members, refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me with a sharp look.
The card reader noticed and stopped reading.
The chief ordered us to proceed.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the SSM city committee and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Despite the fact that my parents left the party, the party has given me their trust.
But I did get married, and besides the National Committee, I also had a church wedding.
I have betrayed the party's trust in the worst possible way.
That's why I was left out of her list of candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and I even gave my mother a church funeral when she died, although she had been a former Party member.
I'm showing a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When the man had finished reading, only the chief's tapping of his pencil on the table table board broke the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
I kept saying to myself, "Communists are supermen, Communists are supermen". What did I get myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix the switch without a fucking inspection.
But now?
She took her career as a customs official before it even started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think that's gonna work. The chief's gonna fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade in question?" the tense silence of the chief was interrupted by a question to the staff officer.
Well, according to a previous employment report.
Is he here?
The framer obviously didn't have a double.
He's dripping sweat on his crutches, winking nervously, as if he's being examined.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"No", the chief said with a hint of cheerfulness that often heralded a storm.
At first glance, he was a man of great reputation, a highly educated man, a graduate of the Industrial College, a locksmith with a job at a clerical job, and a standard of at least a hundred and twenty percent.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?" he turned again to the cadresman, who felt that it was somehow starting to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a cadresman.
Comrade here gave it to me when he was appointed.
That was enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the platoon", the cadet babbled.
And they don't require a report, so his was kind of a bonus, so I put it in his file.
"So, when you were assigned to the technical function, this card was enough", the chief stated bluntly.
The cadresman grinned nervously and didn't have a word to say.
"Never mind, we'll discuss it later", the chief said, and the officer was obviously relieved.
It's all right for now.
"What about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
He'll just poop and that's it!
My eyes were dark, my heart was hot.
There was a flood of remorse and blame, and I knew I was the most repulsive creature in the world, who deserved no mercy.
That by inserting an incomplete report, I misled comrade the personnel officer, when I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from the personnel officer at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element, who, in the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in religious obscurantism.
That, that, there was a lot of stuff that I'd done, or maybe I was still doing, and I was silently praying that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I got fired from the mechanic's job.
I didn't care if they took my little toad.
It's for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, comrade chief", the party chairman suddenly said, interrupting the chief Levites.
Here the comrade has made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he's done something stupid!
But he's already had his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to have his party door closed for a while?
To open them again, he'll have to prove he's changed, that he's worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he that educated or did he just parrot a phrase from party training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must be given a chance!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to reform!
It's your party duty, which no one can take away from you!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us.
Here, the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the president finished, no one even nodded.
This is a turn of events that no one expected.
I certainly am.
"I agree with you, Comrade Chairman", the chief frowned, trying to regain the initiative.
If you'd let me finish, you'd hear that's the conclusion I was headed for.
They nodded in agreement, but it was evident that they did not believe a word he said.
"I have been confirmed for the position of independent resource management consultant", I laughed as I returned to the office and then broke down in tears.
It's a good thing everyone was at lunch except for Eva the engineer.
She listened quietly to my incoherent account of recent experiences, and I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the kettle on and prepared the cups.
Meanwhile, she was talking about HR practices.
Like a report, often full of praise, handed to a man, and a second, with a lot of dirt in it, sent to the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I should have, but on the shelf at the gristle, and so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our frame?
He just cares where he eats or drinks, and that's how it ended, that's how it ended.
"He's gonna get it from the old man", she said maliciously.
He's not gonna like it tonight.
Be careful of him, though, he's a vindictive sort.
And the party chairman?
Basically, far worse than the chief, no lidumil.
Zero from a power-hungry little guy.
The coffee water began to boil, and the office was soon filled with the smell of freshly brewed coffee.
I threw a sugar cube into the cup and quietly stirred the hot potion.
I'm from the worst of the worst.
I'm not getting fired, and the next inspection is in three years.
Anyway, comrade chief, I'll never forget this day.
It was published in the anthology of literature in the second edition of the publishing house of the EPIKA
The symbol of the community came to life.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlum is turning again after years.
It is visible from afar, as it is placed on a 50-foot-high [50 m] pole.
People from the outskirts call it "the windmill on the Chlum".
For the village of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the village coat of arms, which the village acquired on the occasion of the 2010 gathering of locals.
"We asked for a sign and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone in the area knows it", stated Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlumsky wind pump is a local engineering monument.
It's a bit of a modern-day reminder of a time when the people here were fighting for safe drinking water.
In the past, it was a rare commodity in Chlum.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlumsk representatives decided on a solution, which was then accepted until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the Chichov River, they had a well dug seven meters deep.
Three years later, a metal structure with a wind pump was added to the well, which pumped water to a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic na Moravě at a cost of 2,400 CZK", says the memorial inscription on the ground floor of the mast structure.
The engine was repaired several times and the windmill was taken down in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the struggle for water began: a new water supply system was put into operation in Chlum.
The wind pump was no longer more than a nonfunctioning commonplace symbol and a local rarity.
The Dominant was activated at this year's Native American gathering.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumskys decided to repair the windmill and restart it.
They had a replica made of the original wheel - reduced by half a meter in diameter.
The wheel was mounted on a pole, but it had to be lowered that same year.
The replica's manufacturer had not selected the right material, and the wheel was not designed to withstand gusts of wind.
Then the slum dominanta rested for several years under a roof, dismembered.
But since June of this year, the wheel has been spinning again on the high mast.
For the occasion of the native gathering, the community had the replica wheel modified and re-installed it on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only pumps the water from the well into the blind arm of the overpass.
And we turned it off completely for the summer because the well was low on water.
At least it was empty.
"In the autumn, the shafts of the wind wheel from the pump in the bag are disconnected again", explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the windmill has become a municipal symbol, but it is the only one of its kind in the entire Highlands.
A similar element in the sign is in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovic and Zelená Hora in Vyškov, Kuželov in Hodonín, Partutovice in Přerovsk or in Polica in Vsetín.
No offense, but I don't know Lafat, confessed to supporting Tripolis Goian.
"I remember the game against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all the others in my career", smiled 34-year-old Goian at a pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georg Hagi, and it was a shame we lost.
I hope I can score a goal for Sparta now.
Only this time we won't lose", Goian continued.
This man, who has played 60 games for Romania, is the key backbone of the Greek team.
As a stowaway, he will face the onslaught of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people come, no hell, he says about the Greek fight Spartan Hybs.
And part of that is knowing what he's going to be doing Thursday night.
Well, Fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their matches at that time.
I know he's a very good attacker, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name any other players from the Prague club, so the question arose whether he also knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly scornful look, pointed to the Czech journalists.
The look of helplessness on his face said: "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he started.
We were watching some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafat?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else but Fataiah.
The Spartans know that about Goian very well.
"My experience with bigger clubs, you could say he holds the defence of Asteras, he's like their game organizer", noted Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian may have had his best years, but he has a very interesting football resume.
At one time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, Manchester United and City were interested in him, but he moved from Steauy to Palermo, Italy, and also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting an aggressive and unconventional style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
I think he's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the team off with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I'm at peace with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is looking forward to the Czech opponent.
I'm going to.
But I can say on behalf of the entire team that we will fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to the Czech Republic, he's considering entering the Prague stock exchange.
The new headquarters should be Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the company's performance, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
'In connection with the transfer of the group's registered office, the shareholders are considering the listing of the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.'
In order to be listed on the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalising a securities prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding company's headquarters and the related share transfers will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction involving only the existing shareholders.
The operation will therefore not involve any offer of shares to the public or to new investors.
The Commission notes that the Commission did not provide any information on the amount of the aid to be recovered from the beneficiaries.
The company has previously indicated that a possible share offer could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of the listing of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placing of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of Czech TV's objectivity in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of mainstream Czech media's coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news broadcast of Czech TV.
How'd she do?
When journalism faculty teaches about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today's Czech TV broadcast Events.
The migrant crisis was about 80% of the news coverage.
The first minute when the Czech News reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers, euphemistically calling them out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal bars), the current pro-immigrant propaganda was already going - judge by the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for NGOs that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Children in Czech school - the story of Syrians integrated in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as an opportunity.
Refugee travel - The CTA consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not migrant.
What is particularly striking is that the CT consistently uses only images of young children and women in its illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that is unparalleled by Communist agitation.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm embarrassed by my colleagues.
Ecology in action.
Once I had the luxury of living in a one-room apartment, but soon I was no longer the only one in it.
My after-hours toilet is full of fish.
The house fish, the insect with the imperfect transformation, that is, not making that transition from caterpillar to beetle and the young look like an adult, only small and gradually growing.
They were repulsive and I didn't bother to put them out.
First manually, then chemically.
The Socialist drugstore provided blue crystals to liquidate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or some other way?
But it did succeed in eliminating them.
I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar manner later.
A box of some kind of juvenilizing agent that the ants brought into the nest and then he wouldn't let the queen produce any offspring.
But I took a wrong turn.
As time went by, I became more and more impressed by the insects, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they have the same right to life as we humans do.
And I've learned from my life that interfering with the ecosystem doesn't lead to success, and one pest can be replaced by another.
Truth is, with fleas and bugs, I wouldn't mind killing them to make my karma worse.
In our new quarters, my partner and I agreed that if the fish were not going to get on our nerves, they could eat the flakes of skin, the invisible eyelashes, and so on.
Their peaceful existence was eventually disrupted by a spider.
He was a common type of executioner who spent long periods of time on the ceiling.
We thought he lived off the occasional fly and mosquito, which only added to our comfort.
Since he's been with us for several years, we've learned that he's been feeding on fish and apparently keeping their numbers at a tolerable level.
By regular intimate contact with each need performed, we have determined that it is a female.
We've seen romantic courtship with a partner about a third younger than himself, as he carefully grabs onto the web of the spider web to prevent it from being eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It lasted for about three days, when they didn't move or respond to our controls.
In the toilet bowl, where the love games were taking place, we later found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.
And then the spider didn't move for weeks.
Just when we thought it was over, we were surprised to see a number of tiny spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
Partly eaten by their mother, partly scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
A little smaller, though, probably the daughter of that toilet-sitting girl.
She watched our behavior from the ceiling for some time, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our nonaggression as friendship.
The numbers of the somewhat over-populated fish were reduced, and the spider went about its normal feeding business.
For a whole year, our ecosystem has not changed.
Our daughter, meanwhile, had grown to an age where using a towel was a disgrace.
We've tolerated it, but the constant pouring out of its contents has become too much for us.
We urged her more and more to use the bathroom.
But the daughter found an excuse to keep her habit in that spider, which she saw very well when she was wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider, luck in the house of myth didn't take at all.
She screamed and cried, forcing her way into the toilet.
There was no rest.
There came a time when the spider had to take command for the sake of her daughter's developmental shift.
I'm the one who's left.
He was caught in a glass and thrown over the balcony into the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt awful after being together for so long, like I was kicking out a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would start to appear more frequently and start to multiply in a geometrical sequence.
It's been a week, two weeks, and we haven't seen one.
I started to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider had somehow grown them in the ant-like pattern, that the environment of the toilet is not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first medium-sized pieces appeared, and they were already crammed together.
I had to come up with another theory about why they went extinct, and I came up with this one, that their attachment to the spider must have been caused by the fact that if they don't see it, it's hidden somewhere else, and they're in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance triggered some kind of alarming reaction in them.
I'm not under any illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some slight shyness, but not that they would respond to hand waves or quick movements.
My daughter is already going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's already forgotten her nightgown.
All we have to do is lure another spider.
I'm putting my wishes on the air now, and I hope they didn't turn me down after the execution.
Otherwise we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
Ten quotes from Albert Einstein that have enriched the world.
The words of a brilliant scientist from the last century may never cease to fascinate mankind.
He could dive so deep into everything that the outcome was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most influential scientists of all time.
He came to be known for his special and general theories of relativity, which are the best descriptions yet of the universe in its gigantic proportions.
Also, his explanation of the photoelectric effect and the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field are not to be overlooked.
There is no doubt that the very description and framework of the popular theory of relativity is so confusing that many prefer to take easy pauses for closer acquaintance.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he hadn't found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: An hour in the presence of your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of selecting from his plethora of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius people try not to make them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one who can prove me wrong at any time.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to smash an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what the third world war will be fought with, but the fourth will be fought with sticks and stones.
There are a thousand ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much is dangerous.
If I had an hour to master a problem that my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
And in closing, I cannot help but quote Einstein's formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula is: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
The hospitals in the Zlín region are waiting for changes in the 1.5 billion.
"It's an achievement, considering that all four have been in the black all year", Stanislav Mišák, the captain of the team, said with satisfaction.
The total profit of the regional facilities is about 32 million crowns at this moment.
This is due mainly to the higher premiums from the insurance companies, which are just as favourable for this year.
This fact alone shows that after years of poverty, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
This will lead to construction projects in Kroměříž, Vsetín, Hungary's Castle District and Zlín, which together will cost nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of buying mostly appliances is over.
Now we must start building new buildings, because without them, we cannot provide high-quality healthcare, said Lubomír Nečas, the regional deputy for healthcare, in a speech.
He's looking forward to a change in all the hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetina, they are now selecting suppliers for a new indoor pavilion for nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a dialysis facility planned in Kroměříž.
Hungarian Stadium wants to add a new indoor facility to the new central pavilion, which will open this year, for about $200 million.
And the Batov hospital in Zlín is facing the long-delayed construction of a new central reception and inpatient room, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the most fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, for patients and doctors", said Věra Prousková, the hospital's director, regarding the construction of the new inpatient ward.
A five-story building there is scheduled to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for both the neurology interns, dialysis, a new ambulance, beds and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for the patients.
The changes, which are felt strongly by patients in particular, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients are confined to one room, there is only one toilet on the floor, the beds are unable to be moved, the windows are not tight, and the medical personnel lack adequate working conditions.
"For example, our boarding school was built 35 years ago and is now on the verge of extinction", points out Pavel Kalabek, director of the Zlin hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute wards in one place, plus new facilities.
The same model has half the Hungarian Playground already.
The central income is up and running, and in three years, there'll be an intern.
"We will pay for the building with a loan and partly with our own funds", explained director Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one in the county that can afford to fund itself.
It's still at its highest profit and has not lost even two years ago, when the Zlín hospital was facing a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and manage costs effectively throughout the hospital", commented Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients at the nearby hospital are also improving.
Over the next 10 to 15 years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new instruments, and reconstruction.
The toilet will be repaired this year, then the dialysis building will be built, or the new MRI building.

Nobody explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after talks with his European colleagues that other countries are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has explained to him yet how he should keep the refugees assigned to the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
'We did not receive an answer and therefore we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text,' Mr Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you took at the meeting of the EU's Foreign and Home Affairs Ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have some kind of vision, they're going somewhere, they have some kind of kin.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they are redistributed.
We can't imagine what it's like.
We have not received a reply, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about it for a year, and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We were talking about 40,000 a few weeks ago, now it's 120,000.
When is it gonna be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through here want to go to Germany.
We're not getting any of them. We just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, have the ambition to come to us, to obtain asylum here, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, from Syria and other countries, is very close to zero.
You mentioned that we don't want refugees, but we've already committed to taking 1,500 people.
Couldn't we have more of them this way?
We've committed to taking 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said functional hotspots, border control, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that there are 1,100 people coming in who we're dealing with for asylum.
They come to our detention facility, and we treat them the same as the ones we've captured.
It's a big question, and we'll be discussing it with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly Hungary.
Because Europe is behaving in a way that if they have a license, they can't be detained.
That means they come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet, it may happen that we do not keep even the 1,100 in the Czech Republic and they go back to Germany after arriving.
If we can hold them for the duration of the asylum process, we can handle the asylum process.
If it's Syrians, Eritreans, almost 98 percent of them, according to European statistics, are getting international protection.
Then they get papers that allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there's 400 people who will be relocated.
This is the second project that we've started, and the only progress we've made is that we're talking to churches about the possibility of artificially helping them find jobs, housing, and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting with us, the other states were not willing to discuss.
But is it not the case that the Czech Republic is simply rejecting quotas but is not offering any solidarity measure to unblock this debate?
And what exactly is this solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives the go-ahead for all Syrian migrants to join them, then the news spreads in a matter of hours to all the camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's triggering another wave of migration to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think the solution is to protect the external borders -- just to discourage the waves of migration, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Make it clear that they don't stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovans came to Germany last year alone.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, courts, state representative offices.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economy, then those 50 percent of what welfare systems are wasting on them today could go to refugees.
From the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of arrests in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's 80 now, it was 12 the first day.
How far will it go to tighten up border controls?
We were afraid of being inundated by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, any people we detain, we'll return to Austria within seven days.
We do it by the book.
The Austrians are the only ones who take our people, the Hungarians are complicated and the Greeks - it's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the tipping point?
Does it have to be like a thousand a day?
I think it's gonna be a couple hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, we're running out of capacity enough to put in emergency plans.
Then I have agreed with the Prime Minister to call an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in contact several times a day by phone.
If that were to happen, the government could sit down de facto immediately and decide by a single resolution to strengthen the police by the army, let alone the customs administration, or possibly the prison service.
The extreme variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can get that far.
You have to realize that our position is different, we are a nation state within Europe, we only have the Schengen border at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debts at the last minute.
They're trying to avoid a bankruptcy.
Football Slavia has paid off its debts.
The football players got their money.
Soccer Slavia was called in for the first time on Tuesday for insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after Online Services, a company in Samoa, in the Pacific, filed a claim for about 20 million crowns.
The lawyer of Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And I have to say, she had her reasons.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavie became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently, the new owners have been funneling money into the club, and at the last minute.
This is evidenced by the statements of Slavia before the trial on Tuesday - the ski club on Monday, just one day before the trial, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid for between September 11 and September 15", said lawyer Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay to?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivanov or the Czech reserve player Mario Ličko.
Slavia also paid a fee to the agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club paid the dues of the Prague 10 district.
The insolvency proceedings thus de facto only concern the claims which Slavie is contesting.
Either the club claims that the obligations were never created, or they are being litigated.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can prove by a statement from the account", Mládková told the judge.
"All past due has been paid", Mládková said, adding that only defaulted or unpaid obligations were unpaid.
It is also certain that in the next few days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
He gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had indeed paid off the debts in question.
Then there's an evaluation of all the evidence.
A decision can therefore be expected as early as November.
The judge ordered a retrial on November 3rd.
But the decision will not be made at this meeting, but in writing afterwards.

The FastMig X is the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of cutting-edge technology, hardware and software integrated into a modular design brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured to the customer's requirements.
And it's all kinds of things, from structural steel welding to special alloy welding, as well as from coarse material welding to thin plate welding, from workshop applications to shipyard welding.
The incredible number of welding curves, the easy set-up and expandability of the welding source allows for a rapid response to changing requirements, leading to reduced downtime, the need to replace the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with cutting-edge welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
There is no more wasted time, no more wasted materials, no more repairing faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there are fewer straights, more welding and higher profits.
It's a new product, which was premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We value these honors highly, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers have similar systems, but the differences in software and control parameters make the FastMig X one of the world's best.
The delivery times of around three weeks are certainly pleasant for the interested parties.
We have already established first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand after the Brno Fair.
We have been regular participants for over 20 years and our business results are almost always better than before, says Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi store in Pilsen, on behalf of ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blanket could have been built to keep it from falling over.
But it would cost an additional half a billion, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
The blank could have been made safer, says an expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could have been built without two landslides in the Prague Stromovce, says Alexandr Butovič, the production director of Satra, the company that designed the tunnel.
He said that Wednesday night during a press tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it would cost about half a billion crowns more.
It opens to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a trade-off between price and safety.
"The tunnel was safer to build, but the cost is rising exponentially", Butovich said.
Conditions in Stromovce, he said, had been the same all along, yet the ground had fallen just a few steps from where he had begun to dig with a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive", said Butović.
The Blank Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was formed in Stromovce, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The original plan was to cost 17 billion crowns.
Add to that the VAT, which doubled during the construction, and from 17 billion you get 21.
If you add technology, land acquisitions and engineering, recovery and such, it's 29 billion, which is not that far off from the 37 billion, Whitehead said.
Somebody ordered and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system with the new update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking on the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update".
When it's ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users have encountered a problem after installation, specifically with the error message "Software update failed".
One solution to this problem is to wait until the interest in the update subsides, or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will walk you through the update process.
This includes the need to uninstall apps to free up space - but that won't be necessary, because Apple has scaled down the update and also made the whole process easier by using a special tool that will designate apps for the user to delete and reinstall once the update is finished.
Make sure your phone is charged before you launch the update.
If the battery is low, Apple will not allow the update to run, because interrupting the process could cause the update to fail.
Other news: iOS 9 release not delayed despite WatchOS delay; iOS 9 review: exciting new operating system update; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of new iPhone operating system
Make sure you go through our list of things to do before updates, which to try and which to avoid or protect yourself from. iOS 9 introduces new features, including an even smarter personal assistant and a large range of creative features for the iPad, as well as many patches to speed up and fix the operating system.
FedEx's mixed earnings, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in its full-year profit forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it planned to hire about 55 000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's stock was down about 2.5 percent in pre-sale trading 45 minutes before the Wednesday open.
FedEx says it expects earnings of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, a 20-cent drop from its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The downward outlook comes despite an average 4.9 percent increase in interest rates, which will be reflected in January, and higher surcharges for overland heavy or bulk parcel transport, which begin in November.
The company stated that it still expects to see profit growth compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Fred Smith, said that the company "has demonstrated solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday hiring plans were announced the day after rival UPS said it planned to hire between 90,000 and 95,000 additional workers, about the same number it hired last year.
In the quarter ending Aug. 31, FedEx raised $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which was lower than the $2.44 per share predicted by the 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenues in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the bottom line of the FedEx Ground Unit.
In the last quarter, land revenue was up 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially flat because of higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher base rates, while profit decreased in freight due to higher labour prices.
In pre-trade trading about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
They finished Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent year over year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding whether, after nearly a decade, it's time to raise the key interest rate.
Overhead at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Fed has a dual charge from Congress: to maximize American employment and to keep American prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday as to whether the US economy is ready to bootstrap from the unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since late 2008.
Although most data shows solid economic growth, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to the volatility by raising its federal funds rate of reference - by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"It's clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and foremost thing to watch", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with enough justification to wait", she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently polled by Blomberg expected a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator only about a 30% chance of an increase.
This would indicate a stock market decline in the event that the Fed raises rates, only if politicians soften the decline by promising that another increase is in the offing.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers would hold rates this week, according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates now", he says.
If Fed policymakers did so, "they would have to go to extremes in their policy statements and hold the financial markets by the hand so that they do not panic".
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Fed was well on track to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rates to rise this spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has shown solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage earnings have shown signs of rising.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers say the main reason has been the temporary effect of the sharply lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to rally late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has bounced back somewhat this month and the Dow is now down almost 10% from its May high.
The Fed's policy makers are given a complex calculation by the volatile market situation as to when to take an interest rate hike.
"In the absence of what's happened in the financial markets, and the reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would have been a tightening at this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts they'll wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "suck" their monetary expansion into the market, set off a worldwide convulsion.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, chief global strategy officer for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee policy-making body that pushed for rate increases, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions "despite limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest eruption is not even close to that level, he said.
"You don't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because the markets are angry", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act has two mandates left and it doesn't change financial stability, and unless that changes, I don't think they should be at the top.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown, not Thai.
The market/store is a single point of contact offering a staggering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's even a car part if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to go through all the alleys.
If you're hungry from all the shopping, grab a bite to eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The indoor trading booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various collection points.
What's in the store: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in bulk.
The fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and others.
The spread of meat is great, for example fish - the staff at the counter will wash and scour it, even fry it for you if you wish,
Much of the store is left to a massive freezing section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter bed linen, and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
Broad alleys open to shopping carts and forklift trucks.
Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register.
Location: The store is in an industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounded by Chinatown and downtown - a couple of blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other stores and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Highway speeds will remain the same as before.
The House has rejected the 150-mile-an-hour acceleration.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
The House did so on Tuesday, when it agreed to a Senate amendment that rejected the speed increase.
The land communications bill is now headed to the president.
President Miloš Zeman said in late April that he would veto the law allowing the speed of 100 to 100 kilometers.
The Czech Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech highway network is not yet built at such a speed.
A vote on Tuesday before the House of Representatives supported the Senate's version of the bill.
The amendment approved will now allow for an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, particularly four-speed, in line with the original government proposal.
The House first extended the option to highways, which could be driven in select sections at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour, but the Senate rejected it.
The Members have now accepted his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also excluded from the bill the authority of the traffic police to have the last word in the modification of local roads, which are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, which the House of Representatives has approved, also envisages that sewers, water pipes or public lighting cables can be laid longitudinally under the surface of the carriageways.
The municipalities would save so much on the purchase of the land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The new law also aims to improve road safety and make it easier for municipalities to deal with unregistered trailers.
The new measure would allow municipalities to sell towed vehicles for which the owners do not come forward within six months of the notification of the towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third class roads, under the threat of fines even for freight companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of the current paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
The government says it'll save money on the electronic system.
The mouthpiece is going to trial.
He's looking at 10 years for overcharging his credit cards.
The case involves the allegedly overpriced Welcome Citizens project.
The police wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailova (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue her.
Depending on the legal classification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The main hearing is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns in damage, according to the prosecution.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
According to the applicant, the former members of the municipal administration had, by virtue of their functions, unduly allowed the company, which organised the citizens' reception, to benefit from their assets.
According to the indictment, Mandík instructed the then head of the Municipal Department of Municipal Services, Education and Culture to contact five related companies in the selection procedure.
When another company entered the competition, offering the lowest price, the council cancelled the competition.
The contract was then entrusted to the administrator by the city, and only Darothore submitted to the tender, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges, aimed at securing for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organisation of the event Welcome to the Citizen in Ústí nad Labem, were long-term and coordinated, at least in contradiction with the requirement of due diligence, writes the public prosecutor.
At the same time, they were aware that, following the award of the contract, Darothore would charge Ústí nad Lab with the implementation of the Citizen Welcome campaign a price that would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project, according to the file.
The city eventually paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert opinion, at least one million crowns overstated.
Mandik has previously denied any wrongdoing.
I have committed no crime, I am innocent.
I don't understand this fabricated case, said the former mayor, adding that the city under his leadership only continued a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was organised by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money", added Mandík.
The criminals originally wanted to charge Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
The House of Representatives did not prosecute her.
So forensics has postponed the case, but they're planning to charge Kail after her term ends.
The greeting card was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift voucher for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of baby supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly let a dog run over a fugitive.
Then they got the reporter to erase the record.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete footage of a police dog allegedly knocking down a refugee.
The Hungarian government disputes this allegation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday evening, when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a corn field near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The police intervened, and one of the police officers let a Syrian man attack the dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog that killed the man who was screaming "Please, please, I'm a fugitive", says the Muse.
One of the policemen noticed that Muzi was filming everything and wouldn't let him go.
The reporter was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the ground.
The police took Muzi to a dark place near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to erase the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to the spokesman of the Hungarian government, Zoltán Kovács.
It called the police's behavior unacceptable and said journalists should be able to report without risking physical violence and without fear of the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács, citing a police report, questioned Muzi's account of the events.
He said the cops just wanted the reporter to show them if they were in some footage, which they said they had the right to be in.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to frighten and scare, but they certainly don't attack", says Kovács.
The unpredictable league of champions.
A win against City will kick us, Juventus believes
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose", said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the hosts.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many chances, but we had the ball in their hands longer than the others.
"The reason for the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals", evaluated the match Pellegrini, whose team cashed in the competition match after a long 636 minutes.
Last season's finalist Juventus were in the exact opposite position before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, they have only one point to defend the title and with a score of 2: 4 they are in 16th place in the table.
That's why the Etihad Stadium turn was such a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us off", believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supporters - Pirlo, Tevez and Vidal - before the new season.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manjukić and Morata.
"It's true, this victory is very important, hopefully it will help us to ride the wave of victory", Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the offensive phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"Before our own goal, we could have scored 0-2, but Gianluigi held us back", praised coach Allegri's goalkeeper Buffon.
"We've burned some good chances", said Yaya Touré, City's second-row.
We need to take some experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angela, goodbye to the old Germany II.
Before we go on to the immigration issue, we should realize that all this media hype is being run by professionals.
According to the media needs and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies being carried by their parents on the dusty roads of exodus.
And this creates in the person -- in the European person -- automatic feelings of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just bring in desperate babies, but notice in the shots of the landing boats to the Greek islands, the baby's not so much in sight!
And yet, recently, we have lost sight of the images of ships heading for Lampedusa, of refugees from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenades are visited by thousands of young men.
Mostly young black men.
And also missing are pictures of the Callais, where these brown and black men are waiting to try and get through the Channel Tunnel.
I guess he doesn't get it anymore.
Nor did the images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans make much of an impression on Europeans.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of a cover-up that it's not just the unhappy Syrian kids, but also the out-of-the-way, older, fashionable young men.
Whose muscles look like they just got out of a gym.
Just one personal experience to go with it.
This summer in the Turkish-Muslim part of Cyprus, we were lying on the private beach of a hotel.
Regardless of the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived on the beach.
But no ham.
And they're young black people.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked onto the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes, holding, of course, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they didn't care, and the staff - Turks, Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've got all the bunks.
Anyone who wasn't on it and was at sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like they were from an American rap movie.
On their heads, a hat with a nail, white and colored Adidas on their feet.
Then they raided the local beach bar and started throwing parties.
They sat around tables, huddled with the brown and white patrons of the bar - read Muslims and Europeans - without asking.
Mothers and children ran from the dining room terrace to a quiet spot.
The black people who came drank beer straight out of the bottles - as in the US series?! - on the beach throwing empty bottles around.
They were always yelling at each other.
It wasn't in English, though.
Then they drank wine, also straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimwear, especially the young ladies - screaming and howling in the water, mothers with children and pensioners running scared, and in half an hour there was no more black guests on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
No matter if one was a Christian or a Muslim.
Hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah", I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have that at work", said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive gold cross about eight inches high around his neck.
And the women were like jewelry.
"Are these drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw how they were drinking", said the waiter.
They don't sell drugs, they don't use drugs.
They're smuggling something else.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it wasn't that important to me.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the intelligence community and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants made their way to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union has been that totalitarian-politically-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and their associated lobbyists and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now the publicly acknowledged major force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but the EU leaders and the TV, including our own.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on par with Moscow TV footage from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but mostly - Old German - Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For weeks, they babbled on Czech TV news, saying that according to some research, the Germans were almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But anyone who's been in Germany for a few days knows that's a lie.
Which confirms the other information.
For example, the famous public opinion poll organized by ARD - the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, just a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
That's what our TV stations were reporting.
But they concealed what had happened the next day in Germany: that a poll on the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans wanted no more immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
True, five years ago, in November 2010, Chancellor Merkel publicly declared: "Our efforts to create a multicultural society have failed completely".
She went on to say: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society".
"All attempts to achieve such a coexistence have failed completely".
In a country of four million Muslims, she says, the strategy of allowing people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has failed, and they are living here with us today, and we have been lying to ourselves for a while that they will not stay, that they will one day disappear.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we say we just live happily together, that's the approach that failed.
He failed miserably.
But Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against the mighty Germans and Europe and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is escalating fast.
Schulz, the European Commissioner, the SPD MEP, the only one in the European Parliament who allegedly doesn't even have a high school diploma - yes, that's the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play concentration camp guard from the minute - has shown up as he has on more than one occasion.
It seems, especially under the influence of the recent statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
And we note that, with the exception of a few, most European politicians do not support these statements, and the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who for years have tried, at least on the surface, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and a murderer of millions?
Are they right, those who say that in the soul of Germany is seeded the devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right to use all his might to stop the attempts of the Germans to take control of the whole of central Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess I did.
When it was weaned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of a Greater Germany, which had led Germany and Europe into two wars that had cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the Marxists' attempt to take over the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany, based on, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of Nazism.
We'd say it was sunny.
The German elites have long resisted the rise of German nationalism, and so, leaving all those anti-atom fighters alone, enthusiastically seeking a paradise for all, have quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan, "Our forest must live".
To appease the restless young people all over the world who want to do something different and better, they have fully sided with the global warming fighters, shutting down nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavonic current in this current, which considers all Slovaks to be a difficult group - since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulze and German ministers openly threatening the insubordinate Eastern states show, the idea of a leaderless Germany.
Which must be obeyed without question.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if you add in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, is capital, especially German capital, which is comfortable and which derives its strength from the fact that Germany, through its banks and the Union, controls most of the countries of Europe.
The pseudo-sunscream first led the Germans into the swamp of ecology and multiculturalism and today brought home and will bring home perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the sirens, soon find themselves in a reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and start to fight.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours with force again, again a part of its population - but it seems that an ever smaller part - can be ideologically deluded, but in the end reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are already burning.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the incoming Islamists break out?
And to their aid, will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but have not assimilated to the extent of adopting local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when it comes to the issue of naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, who are afraid to see their country Islamized?
What does it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up who will loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-Superman Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that Europe has created by supporting the Sunni ideology, the ideology of the elitist and basically totalitarian, and its voracious banks, is growing.
And because of the unbridled actions towards the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot end well.
Finished tomorrow.
Best way to get rid of the sneaky salesmen: scare them to death.
All you have to do is knock, and the robust doorbell will swing at you in a way that the weaker of nature may not be able to.
A living head will clean you up nicely and drive away the bruised, accompanied (or rather, driven) by the persistent salesman and the living statue.
Maybe it's too bad you can't get a talking flap in the real world.
It'd be good enough to keep out a lot of the bigwigs and the scumbags.
The following species are not included in the list:
A tiny weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it's located in the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is part of the expansive weeds, but it looks pretty good in terms of flowering.
It's between the outdoor tiles.
She's unpredictable, she's doing well in our garden.
It likes a drier environment, is adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although it produces leaves with chaotic composition, it is worth observing and taking pictures of it.
The beauty of the details is only found beneath the close scrutiny - the yellow flowers and green leaves, also with a purple touch.
The Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to teach women about the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding by using images of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are recommended to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affect children's immune systems.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, although Nine's trying to take over the Today Show
The flight of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry to cover the costs of a leaked liberal cable failed to generate enough ratings to boost Today.
The morning show of Nine broadcast from the nation's capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to 330,000 viewers for Today.
Today has seen a slight increase in its ratings compared to Monday 's 317,000 and last Tuesday 's 283,000 , but their number was up from last Thursday 's 343,000 .
Today in the last few months fills the gap on Sunrise.
Today averaged 318,000 in August compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than just the Parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

Big news for Seven was a stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside of New Zealand has an impressive average viewership of 1.219 million.
Critics wondered if Thomson could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results from last night's vote are a resounding "yes".
Seven's The X Factor retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, which smoothly beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed reviews on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new television quiz (from 5 to 5:30 p.m.), hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 to 6:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers  which was enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
With the Chase Australia's ratings down from the second night, the Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will win the 5:30 p.m. final.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

The three finalists agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who's he gonna pick?
The Secret Unveiled?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who won The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood is taking to the bachelor party is shrouded in an impenetrable mystery.
And the three girls who stay standing will definitely not reveal who the real one is, the one who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before, before there were only two left, they unwittingly gave us a hint as to who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut for the quarterfinals.
All three women lyrically sang about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could serve as a spoiler for who gets the Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and the Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the one who would best fit Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a light relationship from day one.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think that during the course", says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a real earth woman, she's a lot of fun", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's a real chemistry between them.
They are good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a pretty good couple.
She claims that during his recent visits to the house, she realized that Wood might be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I had opened my heart to him", she adds.
I asked Wood who he would choose if he didn't eat, and she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that", she said.
I like both girls equally - it's a toss-up between Snow and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest in his move to the States, and a lot of teams have been asking about his great start to training late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit out the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was made by an Australian rugby league convert on the first overthrow kick in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed his confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and fill in for Reggie Bush after his injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers reporter Cam Inman stated that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and focus on the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne made up for it.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for on his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught throwing a pass when he mistakenly left the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start to an NFL career he could have ever imagined.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when a home-field record led to a three-way tie with Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo of him with fans holding the Australian flag after the game on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun pointed at a Siberian railway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his democratic efforts were curtailed.
The U.S. Department of Justice defended immigrants who sought restitution of property.
The couple emigrated in 1984, and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court initially awarded them the amount they had requested, over 2.8 million crowns, but the court of appeal changed their claim to grant them only less than 90,000 crowns, citing the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Supreme Court sided with the immigrants and awarded them the sum initially demanded.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the U.S. to complain.
In the meantime, social and economic conditions have changed to such an extent that the compensation granted under the legislation then in force - even though it was adequate in relation to the property transferred - now amounts to only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be to the detriment of the interveners as entitled persons in the restitution, who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who had no possibility of claiming compensation earlier", explained the rapporteur Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the DS took the side of the emigrants.
'The Court has repeatedly argued that the ordinary courts should act in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the persons entitled and that the purpose of the restitution legislation is always achieved, that is, the compensation of the property damage caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state,' the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fisharova.
Radka Fisharová became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech production of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Timea Rice in the Prague Spiral Theatre.
Regarding her return to the same role, she says: "To date, Evita's challenges have not been met by much performance".
Evita is not only a wonderful role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of First Lady of Argentina by Monika Absolon.
I've seen Moncho in Evie three times, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I suddenly saw a whole new concept here.
I'm a bit of a modernist, but this one's just particularly good.
"The direction of Ondrej Sokol is original, light and contemporary", says Fisharová.
The imaginative handing over of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at the Narozenin concert by Monika Absolonova on September 27 at 7 pm in the Studio DVA theater.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include the joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also be stepping away from the director's desk when he replaces Karl Roden as President Perón during the filming of the film.
In the interest of the public, the sale was extended until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the theater Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
The film was directed by Ondrej Sokol, and originally starred Monika Absolonová.
She is joined by Karel Roden as President Perón and Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs from the workshops of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovski sound in the performance of a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Marek, who participated in the first presentation in the theater of Spirál.
4 killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters against a draft of the new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district head officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of the police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Pan Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before taking refuge with rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under a proposed new constitution, and diminished their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, who are demanding the establishment of their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, have been killed in violent clashes since 10 August.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces  a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands.
Lawmakers voted this week in Kathmandu to pass a draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly can't panic now.
After losing on ice to champion Litvínov, you couldn't even cope with a home duel with hockey player Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a disastrous extra-league entry like last year?

NHC is predicting a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands.
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure system about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added the Miami-based weather forecaster.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google announced this on their blog in a very unusual way.
The story was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoud, based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear", Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with Europe's worsening immigration crisis, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All the contributions will be divided among four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all contributions made through google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million will be doubled.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, which has been ravaged by four years of war, and which has displaced four million people this year alone.
Many are fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For moderately obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight-loss surgery than those given nonsurgical treatment.
"The mortality reports take a long time to display", claims Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote the introduction to a new JAMA surgery study.
Weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, they use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
A BMI that measures a weight-to-height ratio is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that involved two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrektomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who had the surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who did not receive surgical treatment for diabetes remained about the same at 29.
Among the patients who had surgery, 36 percent had their diabetes completely resolved and 28 percent had it partially resolved.
In the treatment group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1% of patients and partially resolved in only about 2% of patients for comparison.
Also, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown to be "generally better in the surgical group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient' s blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the body' s ongoing blood sugar level.
The best way to keep hemoglobin A1c below 7 percent, say researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality over five years, according to the lead researcher, Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu, and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of operations.
After five years, the bypass group lost more weight compared with the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), had greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent), and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent better chance of surviving the next 15 years, compared with the group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone said it's a reassuring result for people with BMIs under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical, because it shows that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group", without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once a patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to make people aware of the seriousness of the situation", he says.
I think once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly link your body to obesity and diabetes, the road back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that in the present circumstances, the interests of mankind should be put ahead of those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in solving the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Ultimately, we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the prosecution of George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, saying that "the violent response of the US has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not to use violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unintended consequences", said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested sanitary towels in the last four years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who have ingested highly alcoholic laundry detergents, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of sanitary-use cases reported at poison control centers in children under 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more of these products, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of children that have to be taken to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Some kids drink sanitiser on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking sanitary to get a cheap whiff.
The teenagers allegedly mixed a sanitiser with an alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the product.
"Children don't think about how it could hurt them", Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive ones are the ones that are perfumed.
The dish is sanitized with a strawberry, grapefruit or orange aroma, which is very appealing to children.
The product contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few sips can indicate alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the toxicology control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't leave a glass of whiskey lying around, but people leave these sanitary products out, and if children get to them, it's a fast track to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four sheets of strawberry-scent sanitary detergent at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered drunkenness in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Njahhai was pronouncing vague words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma as the girl fell and hit her head on the alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or arrange to keep sanitary equipment out of the reach of children.
Other than alcohol poisoning, some sanitary products have been linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitary towel that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The medical community believed the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room", according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to sanitary products and has banned their presence in the classroom.
Police have deemed the foiled plan "innocent gossip", and have referred to the school district's discipline,
No disagreement on the Celtic team.
Griffiths downplays the talk of disunity at Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll turn it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilsson and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons extend their lead over Celtic by 5 points.
A first-half penalty by Adam Rooney gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead over Celtic.
Griffiths denies any talk of dissent
This situation has sparked rumours of discord at Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his team-mates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of a Scottish title rivalry is boring the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, says: "In the Netherlands, they don't show the best of Celtic's matches anymore, and why?"
Because there are no Rangers there anymore.
People here don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They're talking about the two teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement at the Old Firm games, and it's not just the people from Scotland who watch these games.
I'm gonna turn things around for good, Deila's committed.
ROON Dealia admitted Celtic are a bit wobbly, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
The defeat to Malmö and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now topped the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has had a bad time and will rise again".
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what's happening.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic, because it makes the players so much better.
It's very important to stay together now.
Warburton is concerned about January reinforcements
Despite comments that have surfaced in recent weeks suggesting he has already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about the big buy of the reserves and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
A former Brentford boss states: "The winter transfer window is very different from the summer transfer window".
The players who come in the summer have the whole preseason to settle in, as you've seen with our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes you add more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic's Michu goalkeeper is suggesting retirement
Swansea striker Mitch, who was linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted he could retire when his contract with Swansea expires.
The 20-year-old shooter has been having problems with his sensitive ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later revoked - it was the third red card issued by the referee Collum that was revoked.
Neilson stands by his statement, stating, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance".
Griffiths has pledged to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a hot moment", the striker said, going on to say: "I can safely say I won't be returning to Tynecastle unless it's in a Celtic shirt".
The council in Tannadice believes in the Dundee United - Donelly trial
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in redress by the current team management - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boys back on the job", Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for "ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold on to Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh consecutive league title and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a first-half penalty by Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, be it trophies or leagues, without winning this type of match".
Scottish unemployment stays unchanged, while UK total unemployment rises
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 in the period May-July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has risen by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK rate of 5.5 per cent, as figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now standing at 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, said: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witnessed an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the execution of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip get executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As that day approaches, I'm beginning to fear it.
Why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I thought it was a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is conducted to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of press seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe the entire execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and have developed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a reporter at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the subject the story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have said it better", but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist who's on the ground ready to tell the story.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the death penalty case.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not going to go over all the details again.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I strongly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will witness his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
You can turn to other journalists for this purpose.
What you're gonna get from me is the experience of seeing someone I love die a needless death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police pursuit.
Officer Canning Vale was left dry after he pulled a man out of Canning River.
A Peter man's bet to escape the police was foiled after he got into the shallow muddy water just yards away from a policeman who tried nonviolently to persuade him to come back ashore.
Canning Vale Police were called to an incident involving a vehicle overtaking Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water, repeating 'I'm not going out, just come and get me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
"Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried a safer tactic, "police negotiation".
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they're on the run", Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning for the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the organisers have tried to spy on him and threaten to stop the races
Peeter Moody has accused the organiser of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the organisers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and was led to believe that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai during maintenance on race day, which was the final straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for racing and has found himself in a difficult situation regarding Lidarin's positive cobalt smear, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue on the espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes".
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at once", said Moody.
They know it's gone.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head held high and for the owners to think that I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I'd have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, in an interview with racing.com, Moody had blasted the integrity department for trying to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I'll name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables in exchange for information about things that are being done in my stables", Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in the attempt to catch me, they've completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming personal?
Will the RVL grow some balls and arrange for people outside of the coaching position to take responsibility for what's happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think it is.
They may need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them something to think about.
But I've gotten to the point where it doesn't matter anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I'll put pressure on them and put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have my family's support and I can go away.
The coach's frustration levels have increased with the long-running cobalt investigation, including Lidari, and the recent scratching has made him feel like he could "put his license on the table".
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on race day "ridiculous" after the horses' feet were applied clay or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for it", he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating a concussion on the day of the race, which the organizers had already opened an investigation into.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The Cobram driver who escaped has been arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra on the weekend and then drove off after the collision.
A cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorcyclist drove off without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to the Shepparton police.
He's expected to be charged with failing to stop for an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old male from Cobraham, remains in stable condition in hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy returns the blow to rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, has criticised his players' actions as "setting the agenda" for the two NRL premiership favourites.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed the Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm's controversial win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a thinly veiled remark about Storm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "parade" of rugby league and said two Queenslanders were "not too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' actions, saying they were focused on "contact".
Bellamy added that the situation has boosted his confidence because his team is being criticized by two head coaches, which may mean they are afraid of losing to the Storm.
"It's still coming up - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2", he said at Bellamy Center.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems and techniques in the last year, but in the last few weeks, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on contact during surgeries, and that's been a game-changer for us.
Trent's been here for three years and obviously coaches a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock.
It's funny how things like this always come at this time of year.
Bellamy disparaged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours was, and it was just as exciting", Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said at the time that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds cancellative, especially his young reserves with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd want to play if you had that type of player.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two fullbacks like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me feel more confident because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and the Roosters have more goals than the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I didn't watch, but what's the score?
Our game ended 20-18, and we had two more tries in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or is the pausing and not-pausing of the experiments interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at some stage.
The Storm are on a weekend break and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-final next Saturday night at AAMI Park.
Serbian man bailed out for $200,000 on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland was given bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilos of drugs from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with the co-accused at the harbour during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovice's lawyer built his defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he possessed the entire amount and that he could have been at the cafe completely by chance and innocently.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would have fled.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he lived during the coronation.
Maksimović's mother and stepfather jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"From the sworn statements of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden to them", Judge Flanagan declared.
Their efforts alone were clearly inadequate, as the accused did not show up for the trial, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and observe the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send him pictures
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to obtain child abuse photos.
Stevan Hogg took a girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged onto her online chat room, where he had a lot of naughty pictures of kids that had been sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up to find her phone missing and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and before she could alert her mother, she found some disturbing news.
The police were involved and saw five photographs, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" web searches using terms to search for lewd images of children.
Hogg then told police officers that his reason was to "train pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a police officer and scaring them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to bullying people.
He admitted that he was the one who did the computer searches, but he claims he was just pretending to be a police officer to scare off the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
He said he did it to lure them in.
He claims he went crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, who was shaking and crying.
She saw the lewd images on her phone and the defendant was subsequently confronted.
The girl was questioned and spoke about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of receiving or supplying indecent images of children on 14 June last, breached bail on 25 January and failed to appear for court on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender list because he can argue that there was "no substantial sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael delayed sentencing until October because of a report from social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but has been held in custody pending hearings on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offender list before his sentencing date.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe made a bad speech in the Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month he was booed and provoked during his State of the Union address to Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary club, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to obstruct Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that is not displayed, but is labelled 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
He warns the Members concerned to know that their immunity ends in Parliament and once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is going to cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard cutting between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save on the company's business services costs.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its PC and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
'These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable costs for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,' says Meg Whitman, HP's CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores to help businesses transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we'll be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion, according to the company's statement, and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will dismantle the company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, an electrical equipment manufacturer whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP was going through a massive reorganization to handle the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC maker and one of the largest tech firms in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it's still September and if his rehab goes as planned, there's no reason he can't play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from a historical perspective, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere finished last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back to his former form during pre-season.
"This kind of injury is not a career-threatening injury", Wenger says.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's not that big of a deal.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't his ankles or the injury he sustained before.
That could be true from a purely medical standpoint, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also a disturbing pattern.
A survey by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he has only played in 65 league games for Arsenal out of a total of 157.
In a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get competition", Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal start the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will probably join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal's Theo Walcott.
'I try to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe,' says Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to move up from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also unbeaten in a total of 41 matches after maintaining their "invincible" campaign last season.
Wednesday night, the stadium was rocked by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and remains hopelessly out of the running to lead the club to their first European Cup victory.
"This commitment is tremendous", Wenger says.
It's never happened to the Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but I have to be realistic on the other side.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever before regarding suicide among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
At the heart of this struggle is a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who were showing symptoms of depression found that if the depressed person had a high enough percentage of "good-humoured" friends, their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, having a circle of mentally healthy friends is half the chance of having mental health problems.
But of course, for friendships to work, they must first be attainable.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style over content, instant response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled down on our need to appear stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we're more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values -- our personal desire for growth and friendship -- which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and game designer recently explained, money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was the source of his idea.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifices, the moments of watching football on the armchairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the realization that, yes, men can identify with that too, even if they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, "...my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference".
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with their friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about the problems.
Friends is one of the shows that pops into my head when I'm trying to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It highlights the small moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, being an outsider on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support has to come from a closer place, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend on Comedy Central, why not take your friends out for a drink in Central Park, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be aired on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to knock Malmo out of the competition.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG beat Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Di Angel Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut and the PSG player sent the French champions on their way to victory, but then missed several chances before finally increasing their lead when Cavani headed in in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Parisians needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only aiming to qualify for the knockout rounds, but to improve on their quarter-final run they have recorded in each of the previous 3 seasons.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't the classic performance of Laurent Blanc's team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted in front of goal and was later substituted against his home team and the club where he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win away or home in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win is a problem for our opponents and to look comfortable in defence is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve as the season progresses", said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to the PSG team that drew 2-2 at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 this weekend, but was replaced by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger has been touted as the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe after the move from Manchester United last month, and he showed why when he caught a pass from Marca Verratti for Malmo's defence and with a beautiful finish sent a ball behind Johan Wiland into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to be the start of PSG's spectacular victory, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to get to this stage, entered with nine internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two full-backs were a tough opponent.
But aside from Nikola Djurdjec's shot, which just missed Kevin Trapp's far corner in the 34th minute, there wasn't much to offer in attack.
Instead, PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with poor passing and a poor finish, which was not good either from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot five times in the first half and was then disappointed as his shot hit the net shortly after the start of Cavani's second half.
However, he proved much more suited when it came to setting up chances for his teammates and it was from his passing that Di Maria sent a spin shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after extra time thanks to Cavanini, the Uruguayan's sixth headed goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had taken him on from Maxwell's left-wing pass.
This ended all Malmo's thoughts of the possibility of making something of the match, and only a remarkable close-up by Wiland would have dashed David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal from substitute Ezequiela Lavezzi was not recognised at the end of the match.
Malmo manager Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League was last December".
Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a fascinating match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion selling shares
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which has been hit hard by the commodities crash, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of its shares as part of its sweeping debt-reduction plan on Wednesday.
Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay down debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a commodity price slide as China's economic slowdown reduces demand and sparks havoc across markets.
Rights issues sent Glencore's share price to a peak on the London stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the $2.5 billion stock sale is part of a broader plan to reduce its $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold the new shares at 123p per share, a 2.4% discount to Tuesday's closing price.
They sold 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per share.
Concerns about prolonged Chinese growth slowdowns have slashed the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington had visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday news release.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
The President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will be inviting President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
'President Xi's visit is an opportunity to strengthen US-China relations and encourage cooperation on issues of international, regional and common interest, and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two countries,' the report added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US tech leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue to New York for the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
Far from reassuring the European crew, the German-fired emergency beacon is already forcing the ship to change course, reports the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem head-on: it will systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as they enter the old continent - especially Greece - rather than fight over future distribution of refugees by quota on the basis of a quantity that is increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to relocate 160,000 refugees, the EU's interior ministers have shifted their priorities.
Before dealing with the final destination of refugees, we must first filter those who are already arriving and decide the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
'An effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration', underlines the text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the single currency, the EU finds itself at risk of its next big integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases the pressure.
It re-establishes border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in that country.
The central power is making it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday already served as proof.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.
Hungary has already made progress.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
It's a domino effect, but it's also a blind man's view.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already crossed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed the issue intensively in a private meeting with their three Greek, Italian and Hungarian counterparts.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to establish any entry point on its territory, because it fears more than others that there will be no camps on its shoulders, where refugees will gather at its expense.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands off the coast of Turkey this year, twice as many as have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a giant, yawning hole.
Athens, still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has folded its hands.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and the source of common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to implement the checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given a number or a date.
'The challenges facing Greece are common to all of Europe', EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
The idea is to deploy the intervention teams of the European Agency for the Control of Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and to strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be required", warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
In law, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The question of creating a real European border guard has not been formally raised, but Europe is getting close.
The new emergency situation of 28 has, however, put to the side the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was raised at the beginning of the year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still refuse to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained in the text approved by a majority of 28 on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm commitment is the relocation of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed at the hectic EU summit in June, Le Figaro writes.
Seven dead in an avalanche in the Alps, three of them allegedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
Officials say a German woman is the only survivor of the eight-person group.
Earlier media reports said it was Polka.
A woman in her 30's was hospitalized in the town of Briancon with a severe injury to her leg in the femoral region.
The dead were mostly in their 40s, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims have been transferred to Briancon for identification", said the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department, Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the mountainous area of Pelvoux, below the summit of the 4015-metre-high Dôme de Neige des Ecrins.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high", noted rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
He said that a huge snowfall had fallen on the eight-man team at an altitude of some 12,000 feet [3,900 m].
The weather service has issued no weather forecasts for the area today.
Trpišovski before the match with Braga:
Jindřich Trpišovský, in his first appearance in the cups, managed to get through the preliminary round of the European League to the group stage with the Liberca players and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
The Slovak team welcomes the 2011 finalist Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose his style of play on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout stages, where every goal and every situation could have you out on your way to the sleeping group, we're there now, and we're playing six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every goal scored, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by just a two-goal game.
"I'm looking forward to it very much and it's the real Europe, before it was just qualifying", Trpišovský said at a press conference.
He thinks Braga is the top team.
He's going to be very active, they have all the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good with the ball.
It might be a little harder to compete with him because he doesn't have a name, but he's got a player in his squad that I think has scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's a great team at the top level", Trpišovský said.
But he doesn't see Braga as a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think that both in the home competition and in the pre-season we showed that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm it", said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Plzeň out of eleven matches this season.
He believes Liberec can impose his style on Braze.
We're going to have a team that's going to be strong on the ball, but also unusually disciplined.
They play a 4-4-2 formation with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we've found weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players do it on the pitch", Trpišovský said.
We've been studying our opponents a lot in the pre-school, which has helped us a lot, but this time we want to focus on our game, so we've adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, even though it's going to be very challenging, to play to our notes", the coach added.
Student films dominate the Sand, the international festival is about to begin.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries submitted their works for the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Pisa.
Four of the ten films, which were sent to the final by a committee of students and teachers, will be screened from 15 to 18 October in the cinema Portyč.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year the festival has a special theme that evolves from the festival's theme song.
This year, she's a detective.
This year's gala director Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theater.
"And of course we also need to solve the crime that was committed in our hike this year", said Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student productions - feature films, animated films and documentaries.
They will be judged by an international jury, including last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The festival organizers are preparing a program as they do every year.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, the singer Ondrej Ruml, the professional didgeridoo player Ondrej Smeykal, the turbo-song group Poletíme?, the band Zrní, or for example Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first arrival will be Jana Ašenbrenner, graduate of the Sand Film School and winner of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will show the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
On the evening with visitors will come cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the Silesian citizens Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common bonds and the film industry", said a spokesman.
The Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, take multiple job interviews at once and get a job, will certainly help.
The festival is connected with the establishment of the Private Higher Professional Film School in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladana and Milon Terčovi, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held every two years until the sixth grade.
In the event of CK's bankruptcy, insurance companies are to pay the full amount of the claims of their clients.
Insurance companies should pay the clients' claims in full in the event of the travel agency's bankruptcy.
The House decided on Wednesday when it passed the amended law on the conditions of business in tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to substitute bank guarantee for bankruptcy insurance under the bill that's going to the Senate.
Insurance companies are not happy with the obligation to pay claims beyond the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development is insisting on the amendment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel agency bankruptcy insurance if the bill is paid.
But the proposal has also been criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development, Karla Šlechtová (ANO), pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation were not Eurocompliant.
She pointed to a decision by the Constitutional Court this year, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
The Commission will continue to monitor the situation and will continue to monitor the implementation of the new rules.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it has to be limited in order to be feasible", opposed TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
He says the bank guarantee won't work because nobody gives it indefinitely.
"Travel agencies will have to close or move abroad", Kalousek warned.
Member of the board of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouskov's concerns based on a survey among CK members.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies", he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of the insurance companies to be relevant, as according to him there is no official written statements of the insurance companies in this respect.
They're checking to see if the travel agencies are complicit, which Okamura says is fine.
Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Czech Travel Agents, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the erasing of stairs by Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
Travel agents, according to Fischer, won't be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection is working", Fischer said.
Her motion to have the controversial passage removed was not passed by the House.
Neither did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) with the proposal to return the proposal to the committee due to the alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Philip warned of travel agencies that he believed could endanger consumers.
The rapporteur for the preliminary draft, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, which would have limited the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance coverage did not cover the entire risk, in view of the ruling of the Constitutional Court.
The amendment will not introduce the originally proposed minimum insurance limit of 4 million for travel agencies offering air travel and the limit of 1 million for agencies selling, for example, bus trips.
The threshold remains at 30% of the planned sales of the tours.
However, the limit of the insurance cover will have to be such as to cover all the claims of the customers in the event of the travel agency's bankruptcy.
The revised standard provides that travel agencies will have to re-indicate which tour agency is organising the tour on the sold tours.
Travel agencies will have to provide insurance companies with, among other things, data on the organisation and number of trips before the contract is concluded.
The amendment adopted by the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information to be given to insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and the number of trips sold, the total price of the trips sold and the amount of the advance payments and sales of the trips and the tickets.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of its legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will either expel it according to the draft to rectify or it will be able to prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment also aims to reorganise the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the grant to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted by the end of April of each year for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of public funds in the last year, a financial plan of expenditure and a forecast for the next two years.
According to the association, the legislator did not consider the situation that would arise if the insurance company terminated the CK contract.
She's not allowed to run the tour, and clients who bought the tour before the insurance was cancelled are going to lose it, according to the association.
In such a case, the CK would suffer a significant loss and might even go bankrupt, despite the fact that its management was in good shape.
One way in which travel agencies can deal with this situation is to sue the State for compensation.
Another option would be to go abroad and use the much softer conditions abroad and then we will only act as agencies in our market, said the vice president of the association Jan Papež.
The draft amendment also includes the institution of a bank guarantee, but it is so ill-conceived that it cannot be implemented in practice, as a bank guarantee cannot be set at an unlimited amount.
Moreover, the association considers that the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the next two years, the whole law will have to be revised again due to the new EU directive.
The Czech Republic has a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
Only three CIs have ceased their activities this year.
Domestic travel agencies sell about $25 billion worth of trips annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve the humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the flow of refugees into Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after meeting with German state premiers.
The EU is also calling for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU to be made available to the 28 Member States.
We must do more to help the countries from which refugees come, or those in which they stay after leaving their homelands.
The EU is also working to ensure that the EU's citizens are able to live in a safe and secure environment, she said.
'The Federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis among European countries,' Merkel added.
The Braniborska Land's Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expected all EU states to show genuine solidarity.
The Czech Republic, among others, has long rejected the allocation of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance of staying here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start more quickly with the integration of foreigners, said the Branibor Prime Minister.
He also believes that most of the money Germany spends on caring for refugees should be used to integrate those who have a chance of being granted asylum.
More teachers will be needed to help the refugees master German.
"It's a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if refugees can be integrated, they can be a great asset to us", he said.
Matt Damon downplaying diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity, claiming it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO's Greenlight, the actor casting the series interrupted Brown when she stressed the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
"When it comes to diversity, you do it in the casting of the movie, not in the casting of the show", Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted with dismay and suspicion, and she said, "Hoo! Wow. Okay, " when the Martian comments were aired.
Damon and Brown have joined well-known producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to behave towards the character of Harmony", Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker who's being hooked by a white pimp.
Dear White People's producer championed finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon ruled that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the debate was aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed outrage at the writing of the clip, "Matt Damon has jumped on the talk of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO BIG that it hurts".
The tweet has received over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national traction and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement while announcing the nominees for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Alba is still important", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love", declared the leader.
Damon was recently named on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to the Pope's visit to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope is unclear.
 American Ninja Warrior has its first winner 
Professional mountain climber and pickup Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home $1 million.
In the competition, which has just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors have managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this year's season finale, two men battled it out for the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The final obstacle was a 30-second climb down a rope more than 700 feet long.
Britten made the climb first and within the allotted time limit, becoming the first competitor to overcome the grueling 4th stage in American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero overcame him by a full three seconds to win the competition.
Caldiero was interviewed by E! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was revealed that he was still in shock from winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life", Isaac told E! in response to his win.
♪ So suddenly... ♪ ♪ I can't even imagine what it's like now ♪
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten will not receive any reward despite being the first contestant to complete the course.
Because according to the rules, the money goes to whoever finishes the track first.
"If there are more than one competitor on the track, the winner is the one with the best time", said Weed.
Even if winning the jackpot would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
I don't think he has a grudge.
He's happy that he's managed to achieve what he's done.
He's got a warm reception from the fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
To his children and his wife, he's a hero.
Geoff said to me, "If there was anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just got by the Minnesota Twins.
For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, are currently in last place in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers narrowly avoided defeat when they beat Minnesota 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins have missed a chance to close out the Houston Astros and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Even if it was just for one night, for Detroit it was a return to the Z word that had been so elusive to them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun, no matter how you do it", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive start, and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took another in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed 6 1/3 hits and 3 runs.
It was only his third win in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with a convincing result", said Simon.
It's hard to get into a game when you're on the bench so much, and I want to get in the game.
Tiger pitcher Victor Martinez hit three home runs and drove in two runs, his first career strikeout since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was his first three-point game since the last game of June, when he hit four homers against the Seattle Mariners.
"You've really gotten yourself into it", Ausmus said.
He looked good in practice, he was hitting a lot better, and he was able to carry that over into the game.
With three laps to go in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins have their best chance of getting back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton has taken the turn with two points to the left of the field.
Right-handed Aaron Hicks scored on a set-up, and Simon knocked out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy took out his only opponent, Maurer, and had Miguel San batting up front, who hit a two-run home run to left-hander Drew Verhagen.
With two players on the mound and a chance at a second-round tie, VerHagen managed to send the third-yard run over two yards.
Plouffe has scored 27 runs over two innings this season and is the king of the league table.
Detroit held on for the ninth inning, Mauer got two strikeouts and Bruce Rondon made the score 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander has knocked San out on three overtimes.
Detroit took advantage of the Phil Hughes game and scored a run.
The Tigers have won three innings in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came into the game after more than a month's absence due to a back injury.
'This is definitely not the start I had imagined,' said Hughes, 'but in the third period I felt that I was doing a better job of hurling.'
After fighting off the first-half charge, Hughes gave the second-half point to Ian Kinsler.
Two outs for right-hander J.D. Martinez gave Victor Martinez the lead in all the goals.
Victor Martinez has ended his streak 0-21.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a right-handed run to score another run, but Victor Martinez was overthrown trying to run to third base.
The Tigers added to their second-inning effort as pitcher James McCann and catcher Anthony Gose gave them two and one-plus points, and the score was 3-0.
"It's got us down to our knees", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place.
Hughes, who won the toss, was out of the game in the third inning and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three home runs, six RBIs and four strikeouts.
ANNOUNCER: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right-handed pitcher, has been sidelined with a sore right shoulder.
He'll be attended to by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the injured list with a strained shoulder since mid-August, should be in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return from injury to face the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded to left-handed pitcher David Price, he's 1-1 in four games.
But he hasn't played since August 20th because of a strained muscle.
The Tigers and the Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is facing Minnesota left-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming governance on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open-ended policies", he said of the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
The promotion of opening up in the nascent reforms will add new impetus and vitality, as well as provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Leadership Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list regulatory market access, liberalization of border control policy, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganization of the registration system.
The Declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment thresholds.
This system will be tested and improved gradually through pilot programmes.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensure a legal business environment and make the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and make sure that companies themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The declaration also states that China will enable cross-border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are funded from abroad and provide them with better services", the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a 'green card' by optimising the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the issue of ensuring lawyers' rights to practice and developing professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and senior officials Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
A new hospital ward may be established in Karlovy Vary.
The Commission considers that the measures under investigation constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
But there are also possibilities for extended care in the region.
For example, a day surgery centre could be established within the surgical department, where, according to a defined concept, surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
Which specific hospitals would have a facility focused on day surgery, is not yet clear.
The skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital could also be equipped with a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apical center to care for brain-disabled patients who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be centrally located and should be an integral part of the anaesthetic-resuscitation unit.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the hospital of the Islands, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be inadequate in Karlovy Vary is the bed for follow-up care, in particular the bed for long-term patients (LDN), which is inadequate in Nejdak and should be closely linked to the bed for acute care.
Part of the facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the design recommends.
He points out that the main shortage of post-operative care beds is in the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There, abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, there is no social health bed in Karlovy Vary for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
This bed is in short supply throughout the republic, so it could serve as a so-called Alzheimer's center for other counties.
The recommendation also calls for hospitals to prepare for the introduction of so-called "conveyance beds" for which European funds will be used.
'These beds will be linked to the fields of subspecialized care and will provide space for the transfer of patients after surgery, for example after cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedures,' describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
