Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widespread theory, but it also provides details that the fossils can't give, like color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed stem called a rack, but do have other features of feathers -- branches and twigs -- the researchers concluded that the rack is probably a later evolutionary achievement than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but more likely for thermoregulation or demonstration. The researchers speculated that the specimen showed an adult plumage and not a younger plumage, although it was a tail of a young dinosaur.
The researchers speculated that the specimen showed an adult plumage and not a younger owl, although it was a tail of a young dinosaur.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and wounded more than twenty others yesterday morning.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate an observation made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that the tidal forces would cause between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon applies gravity to the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way applies force to the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds a galaxy as a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "very disturbing and alarming, because it has a very high mortality rate".

They're colder than the surrounding surface, warmer by day and warmer at night.
"Their temperature behavior is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with those that are deep caves in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeological Team at the U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put the pre-printed sheet of paper with a hint of their favorite candidate in an envelope.
Once the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the polling station and signs the ballot.
French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are added before the start of the election and that no envelopes are added except those of the orderly calculated and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each phase of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close control, according to specific procedures.

The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to the Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since remained in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, accused of murdering his son.
She is being held pending an official indictment and trial, but any deposition of a witness may be affected, as her image has been widely circulated.
It's a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, and courts consider publishing photos as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes, "Journalists do seem to be getting close to a dangerous line when they publish photos or other details about suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, explained to journalists that no further comment will take place at least until the charge is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to have based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues related to the issue, they say, will include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuing military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, while the PA agrees to leave the presence for only five years.
Firefighters in the aid pest control trial had to be carefully inspected by the foresters, while the trial was studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sporting Fans Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Fans Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a means to advance the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by a failed election, some postponed from 2011.
About 60 cases of discontinued iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEKI) reported that 27 accidents related to the devices are known to it.
Last week, MEKI announced that Apple had reported 34 new incidents of find-armament, which the company calls "negative".
The ministry responded, calling Apple's delay of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong as hostages after catching their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been released, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers eventually replaced an old woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed his father's example and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as a obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
His research showed that delivering a hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes', flight logs, on Wednesday.
Even fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Moon passed away in the night of two moons. Unique enough, as she is herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the opinion poll share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia will never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three staff races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints cast doubt on his ability.
He couldn't use the medicines he needed to live his pain because they're forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various devices and software, until early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water supply for the Earth, as well as of organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his reign earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to older ground radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and to give pilots more accurate information.
There is no extra transportation, and the land trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking spaces or parking and driving facilities on the site.
Fear of a lack of transportation has raised the likelihood that the game will be played behind closed doors, without supporters of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken longer, due to a mating between the endemic Darwin fringe, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cacti fringe, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in a variety of shapes. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
It can be pulled to get a thin wire that can be folded and folded. It can be hammered or rolled to a sheet.
You can make it very thin and then paste it into another metal. It can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator by using red beet juice.
Coconut juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of their electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, compress them together as a ball.
Wet on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and form like a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a water-spray toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewer system.
Remnants of a sewerage system were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, bathrooms were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it down, almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and sight.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has made possible is providing much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it we have a train, a car and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are larger cats that eat a medium-sized prey on the scale of rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless pets) that eat the much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a specialization that every cat retains, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in groups called herds.
Greg is made up of one to three adult males and many to thirty females and offspring.
The girls are usually in close kinship with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act quite similarly to wolf herds or dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to the prey.
A very harmonious athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
A tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but rather a phrase of roaring, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch apes, snakes, rodents and birds as much as possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by smell, sniffing the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with their night vision, and they also move very imperceptibly. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the surroundings and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (as if they cross a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island, so they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will have to have different attributes or adaptations to those they needed before, to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
And finally, thousands or even millions of years later, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species, which simply means the formation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they take away carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also give shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetables. Without vegetables animals could not survive.
A mosaur was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosaur.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in its roof, meaning that nothing that met it could escape.
I'm not sure, but it could be that it had a bipedal tongue. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosauruses, and maybe it was even a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tiranosaur would be unlucky to attack it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their own set of strange or unusual feasting items, including wild boar, turkey, hedgehog and a species of rodent called the gland.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, the rich men liked having parties together where they could rest on their sides, eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome could not be foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which was only allowed to enter the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zigurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place in the fresh air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open sales tables in front of the street. They used stone to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been expelled from Iceland for murder, and along the way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there's a writing on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote this, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimensions are 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for holding.
So it's probably just a label that was added to the note.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south still remained not free.
It was ruled by the French of "Vichy". These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
After only two weeks the Americans and the free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture co-owned by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civilis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and this also defines the dimension of society in some way.
Cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilization culture involves the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a continuous cultural trail and a fairly large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with a congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, as there was no national executive or justice, it entrusted the execution of its decisions to authorities of the states, which were often not cooperative.
It also had no jurisdiction over tax laws and customs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before any change, and states referred to the central government with such a soft name that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, skating, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the combination of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, "archipel".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the indigenous ways of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces occupied Taiwan's western and northern border areas and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machupikchu is made up of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 30 centers of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for taking still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension at the close of the analog film era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its proportions were inherited from the sensitive formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (APS format, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The often insulted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, keeping a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became the object of critical research.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that the church's means of financing exist specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years the central authority of the church was in Rome and this concentration of power and money made many doubt whether this dogma was obeyed.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a sea blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off very important military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by some international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain has been traversing international waters to prevent any vessels from entering entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Since such a tactic had a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited military use of submarines.
During the 1912s the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a return of such a situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at the former workshop) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of showing different time periods; every era in China or every family that ruled was a separate dynasty.
Also among all dynasties was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those periods there was a fierce battle between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands dying fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of a metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and successful.
The same is true of the warriors, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside this daily life. He attended a cave that became known as the Hiraj on the mountain of the Noorj (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you're in a cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing else is seen except the beautiful, unflinching sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world is seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built to honor a dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains a number of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a number of small tombs, a number of temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples many were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arch up" mark looks like a V and the "arch down" mark like a cramp or square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the arch, and down means you have to start at the heel (that's where your hand holds the arch) and pull the arch.
A bow up usually produces a more delicate sound, while the bow down is stronger and firmer.
Do not hesitate to add your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed archmarks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be observed.
The feared King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the sister of the King's Lady Elizabeth were brought back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of market women.
They drove to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people, shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen open the windows of the chariot wide open.
At one point a massesman shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the feared queen.
The military expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to compensate for much of the expenses and the interest on the bonds circulating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the surplus profits generated by the extensive exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the templates, we need to understand the context that helped lay the foundation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is usually called the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
Before the Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends by agreement around 1500.
Technological determination is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has its own, not socially conditioned, consequences for societies.
You could say, for example, that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and with the passage of time customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and those, more in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
In the 12th century its status degenerated mainly because the crusaders returned with silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
But because of the slow media, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major achievements of the period was that people used buttons to attach clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Sustainable agriculture is agriculture made to produce enough food for the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using conserved seeds native to the ecoregion with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who feel neglected by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculturalists often mark their membership by recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affection and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, growing up due to neglect, bad luck or malicious abuse, were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children were imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such a child's renunciation was due to the rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Wild-faced children could experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in nature by themselves.
Raised only by nonhuman animals, the savage child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular caring animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, and a teacher is a variant of a scaffolding and the little clip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into software and must ask, suggest and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner to follow if he acted on his own.
Children find themselves in a custodial institution for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring and educational, but nevertheless it happens.
We see the curator system as a safety belt for these kids.
Our curator system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A curator must provide everything necessary that they lacked in the house from which they were previously taken.
Internet brings together elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet give an additional dimension to the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialising are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James, 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified personal engagement and long-term relationships as new motivational aspects when they investigated public responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Especially they claim that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech suggested that people who cannot understand speech because of brain trauma, can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even assumes that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
A mutation adds a new gene variation, and selection removes it from the group of visible variation.
Splitting and recombining remixes the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy their needs for amino acids from available crops.
And, in addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: decreased growth, undernutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest available plant resources would be proteins from leaves and beans, but these are hard to digest for primates like us if they're not cooked.
Animal foods (anthers, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
And given all the circumstances, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in a way similar to what chimpanzees do in a savannah today.
Sleep apnea is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10-160 minutes).
You can do that easily, using a relatively quiet alarm clock to get back to consciousness without waking up completely.
If you notice that you are rearranging the clock while you sleep, it can be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get up to turn it off.
Among other options based on biorhythms is drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which will make you get up to urinate.
The extent of inner peace a person has is negatively correlated with the extent of stress in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the road to that goal is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by a mahajan way of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is aroused by yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and imaging.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation. By imagining various deities, one cleans the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the collapse of systems, processes and cultures led to the countries' splitting up.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and have real battles, with replacement armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, the only hope remaining was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were expired almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time preventing the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
The most recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them because of easy access to milk, wool, meat and fur.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds roaming hills and other pasture areas, often tended by goats, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Wagon roads have been built in England since at least the 16th century.
Although railroads consisted simply of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Spals appeared early enough to keep the tracks on the spot. It soon became clear, however, that tracks would be more efficient if they had a iron strip on top.
This became a popular practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more quickly.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron railings were introduced.
The earliest known transport was by walking, people began walking vertically two million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk vertically as often.
Dupieda specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes probably went on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It's like taking an anti-symptomatic medication in many cases. But if we want a more than just a temporary solution, then we need to find the causes of the problems and we need to disable them.
Of course, the world has changed the scientific and technological achievements of mankind a lot, and the problems have become even bigger because of overcrowding and the wasteful way of life of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten note signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap's Posters.
The document's first public reading was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York City on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs lived and are alive now. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and nails, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, using computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of a drug or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitic humans.
Rabosyms and bedosyms are both nightshades, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women have twice as much chance of getting MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not look out for their interests, or the interests of their child, in the best way.
Such couples can choose to plan adoption for their baby.
During an adoption process, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand by a scientific method how the world works. This method actually guides most scientific research.
But it's not alone; it's also an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became evident as being separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend critically on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to the external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a period of repeated autonomous functioning even without external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions about DNA being genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the wrapped piece of genetic material and whether the wrapped cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can pass to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the view, including wildlife and flora.
Examples of on-site activity include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting Borneo and taking pictures and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave towns by car to go to work, and are passed by by others who aim at the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting everyone is in some way involved and contributing to a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shaped the biosphere of one of its stable states, which has been supporting human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or about the collapse of bridges.
Why are transport systems following complaints like this, why are they failing every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of separate drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because you can't predict a driver's behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform arrangement; so traffic flows strive to have some moderate uniformity and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, develop and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places for predators.
Today the only insects that can't fold back their wings are dragons and ephemers.
Thousands of years ago a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seemed reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
The full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon river is 6,387 km (39,880 mi) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in terms of the size and technical skill of their construction.
The Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the daily language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about the basic chemical elements -- like gold, silver and copper -- from the ancient world, because these are found in nature in basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he continued to theorize that they become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that in the periodic table there are many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could be pushed into a point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good tool for many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil fell out of favor for a lesser status and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil.
You can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The fission bomb operates on such a principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope, and breaking the core releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with some or no touch.
The surface of the Moon is made of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the hidden side.
It's less thick under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is less thick. It was easier for lava to spill out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out what makes people act or challenge them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been interned as they mature into adulthood.
These theories explore what is in certain people, what makes them desire the things they do, and what things around them will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is an effort to remain one of the friends.
This type of manager is difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, assess the effectiveness of work, assign and demand responsibility from people.
On the other side of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done before, and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often this behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high-quality standards as traditional teams, but there are fine differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administrators.
The presence of a true Invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the executive team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up an educational organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively through the functioning branches of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovation process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and also of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows the scope and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior makes scientists continue their research.
It's a long-standing fact that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumor affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong shade of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to a client's diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and warfare, and are also embedded in some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take his students to places not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a trip virtually is another great way to think about a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina produce a website about their trip to the state capital, every year a new version of the website appears, but the old versions remain accessible for use as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing among students. While students often start their blogging experience with flawed grammar and spelling, the presence of the public generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "teaches students to become more understanding of the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an instrument that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of someone else's writing and also outline their own point of view on certain problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and it has a host of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders think is essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
This population comparison is surprising to many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens overall.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or linked to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it took root in the Comoros and Mayoto.
Europe's influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama of Portugal initiated the Kabba route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: We recommend that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marriage.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what would be considered bullying, and they are not uncommon to be followed, held in arms, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and don't be afraid to give up (culturally or not, a difference is not necessarily to be tolerated!).
The modern town of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Benymeans as a strategic port with the name of Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them as Casa Branca, but nevertheless they left after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up shops there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is among the most unpopular places in Morocco.
Around the old town centre it is easy to find shops of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, nargiles and a whole range of glitters, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets, mainly in the city centre.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must be informed of every visit outside it to know the state of the ongoing battles in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest mountain gorilla trail in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to drive through Goma. The standard (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become bored as a metaphor for exotic and distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed on the Red List of World Heritage sites due to the threatened sands of the desert.
It was one of the most important stops during the PBS special Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is very different from the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocrodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 separate ecoregions, all of which support different animals.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the most symbolic of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance routes for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many tourists consider to be the most interesting.
The line of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shiny histogram, which is evident from the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross to the front, which is located on the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban growth is concentrated on land that has been reclaimed from the sea on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have assigned to themselves, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a convenient place to start looking.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) across the coast further into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp, however, it contains some of the last refugees of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or marshes.
In 1966 Sundarbans became a reserve and it is estimated that its territory is currently home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 sighted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (over the river) all day, but most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those traveling west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Since the inter-county buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Common taxis are fast and convenient means of transportation for travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters wide and it has two corridors 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 metres apart. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully restored to service in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs crossings are scheduled to be completed.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, living as quasi-native hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of India, was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began an era of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since Asuncion was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best teams and players in Poland in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the Polish fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value has been equated with that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted on all the islands and in Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but you can take British and American money; ask first to know which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, change the money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer, while in the northern hemisphere it's winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be very cold: the temperature rarely gets cold, but wind and humidity combine and so you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate rainy and dry seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities ask that you stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they look, bison, elk, deer, bears and almost all big animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, tens of visitors are injured because they are not keeping themselves at an adequate distance. Because these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, guard their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruise ship. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggles organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to its location between two ports. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of Noth Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with shops lined up along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many wine wines from France to drink, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better shipped in.
It's perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians the idea of coffee flat white is foreign. An espresso is short black, a cappuccino is worn with plenty of cream (not foam) and the tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards. Juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many excursions to the reef throughout the year and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals and pay close attention to security warnings.
Cuboos appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They may sometimes appear outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and they would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may be able to book accommodations with such agents for other types of accommodations, such as campsites.
Travel agents generally pass through plans that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They may also keep your reservation if you need time to consider the proposal or to provide you with other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp on site and the majority consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the matter, you'll have to come in early to take a tent place next to the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have stopped, but there may be parts of the festival where it will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with small children.
If you're going to sail the northern Baltic in winter, be careful where the cabin is, because going through ice makes a pretty terrible noise in those most affected.
Leisure ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers from pleasure ships are free of visa (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to ensure that the guests spend the most of their time and money. Windows and clocks are usually not there and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them inside.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs mental ability and every good gambler knows how important it is to be sober.
Anyone driving a vehicle in high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low and therefore you cannot drive like on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, the amount of snow that can block you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or wind, condensation, ice on the windows of the car.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Saffarians are perhaps the most attractive tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The word safari is popularly used to mean a journey around the earth to observe the amazing African fauna, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary tools give good eyesight.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes timid, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a walk in the field, a walking safari, or walking) consists of walking, whether for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the 1964 Games, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked the flights and accommodations for 2020, before the delay was announced, you are likely in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but, in the case of late Tuesday, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and typical tickets will cost about 7,000 yen.
Smooth wet clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have borrowing glazes and ice boards, even if they're not in the room.
If a grinder is not available or if you do not want to wear grated socks, you may try using a dryer, if available.
Be careful that the fabric does not overheat (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burning damage in it).
There are different ways to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it takes one minute of boiling water, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different performance, and if you care about that, then consider buying the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can be plagued by animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons or carry infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a person by force, are generally not counted as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, sometimes passing through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be extremely careful: the most common are steep slopes, narrow corridors and curved lanes.
Signal speed limits are significantly lower than those of the front and rear sections  often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and they are strictly adhered to, even more so than otherwise.
It's remarkable that mobile phone service is still much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, similar to those of our neighbor in the south, Austria.
There are many fruit bakeries that contain apples all year round, cherries and prunes in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cuisines usually go especially well with a cup of intense coffee.
If you want some small but rich cooks, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A carrot is a food made up of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A carrier can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a vast term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the island, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spicy foods, with the preferred tastes of Javanese, namely peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Hanging from both sides of the saddle, the feet act as supports at the rider's feet.
They give the rider greater stability, but they can present safety concerns, as the rider's feet could possibly get trapped in them.
If you fall off a horse while riding, the foot caught in a footstool, you could be dragged by a horse that might be running away. To minimize this risk, various security measures can be made.
First, most riders wear slippers with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow heel.
Additionally, some seats, mostly English seats, have safety rods such that a falling rider can pull back to untie the seatbelt.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing spot in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The peaks offer amazing views. Climbers from every part of the world are constantly creating new paths out of the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downward winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you glide down on a snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many fans, who are known as ski-obsessed people, planning entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skimming is considered a sport since at least the 17th century and in 1861 Norwegians founded Australia's first fun ski club.
Ski back-to-back: This activity is also called field skiing, skiing or skiing.
It's like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, but it doesn't usually involve them, because the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skiing and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were a hiking route.
In good conditions you can cover slightly larger distances than on foot, but very rarely will you reach the speed of skating without a heavy backpack on well-maintained roads.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries you need to repeat visa and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates in this respect as if it were a single country.
Provided that you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without having to pass through passport control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa separately to every Schengen country, which saves you time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what kind of goods are antiques. Some tax agencies count as antiques goods that are over 100 years old.
Because the definition changes locally, in places like North America, the ageing rate may be lower than in Europe.
You could count crafts as antiques, even though they're newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Boat breeding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding their trade is important also for many other artisans.
Even in tradition, not all Samoans were engaged in large-scale breeding of boa, but they lived off fishing, hunting or something like that, using boa mostly as pets.
Nowadays many Sami work in modern jobs. Tourism offers a significant income to the Sami region.
Although the word Gypsy is widely used, especially by non-Romans, it is considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and erroneous ideas about Roma.
If a travel warning is issued against the country to be visited, it may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even if they are directed to their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East could be in situations that are different from those that affect Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simple compared to the more detailed information that you can have elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, major social disturbance or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and it consists of various types, depending on the location, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
Wind, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are presentations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizzards, blizzards, winter storms and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable for travelers to be aware of all kinds of risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Every visitor to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An online search for a course for hostile environments will most likely show the address of a local company.
A course will generally cover all the things presented here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
One course will normally take 2 to 5 days and will include rowing, a lot of rescue and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wild, but there are few such works about war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must make sure they have valid documents with them when they return.
The willingness to issue passports without gender (X) or updated documents in accordance with the desired name varies from government to government.
Whether foreign governments are inclined to accept these documents is equally highly variable.
Security checkpoints also became much more demanding in the period after September 11, 2001.
Unoperated transgender people should not expect to go through the scanners without their privacy and dignity being intact.
Surfing is the retrograde flow of waves broken at a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Because of the diverse underwater formations, the retroflow is concentrated in some deeper sections, where a rapid flow to depth can occur.
Most of the deaths occur as a result of trying to swim against the tide, which may be impossible.
As soon as you swim out of the stream, swimming back is no harder than normal.
Try to target a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities or whether you've been noticed, you might prefer to wait until you're rescued.
The return shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty adjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of the native culture.
When you first went abroad, people probably had patience and understanding, because they knew that drivers needed to adapt to the new country.
People cannot foresee that patience and understanding are also needed in relation to the travelers returning home.
The pyramidal spectacle of sound and light is one of the most interesting things for children in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and merchants. The intersection of sound and light is just like a novel.
The Sphinx is set against the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
You project the scenes onto the pyramids and light up the various pyramids.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are deposited by a number of countries and they have the majority of bases, sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, whose flooded caldera of still active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Once joined with the plateau here, the mountains of the peninsula eventually reappear forming the Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is 360 kilometers long and is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel mountain range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is 4892 m high.
In remote areas without access to a mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be the only means.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you have to be out in the sky with a clear satellite view to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure cruisers, as well as expeditions that have needs for remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider could provide you with further information about the connection to this service.
For those who plan a Saturday year, it is becoming increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who graduate from high school, because it gives them a year off before they go to college, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you enroll in a sabbatical course abroad, it can actually improve your chances of advancing to higher education once you're back in your home country.
There will normally be an application fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos
In the archipelagos and on the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaking offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one in seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is only seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. But it is a rather unique statistic (e.g. in the Netherlands one in forty people owns a boat).
Most of the various Baltic cruises also include a stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can fully use a few days to visit the historic city, returning to the ship at night to sleep there.
If you only disembark by boat, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience regardless of age and background, especially if you've never flown or if you've had a traumatic experience.
It's not a shameful thing: it's no different from the personal fears and related dislikes that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on not knowing or controlling things.
Courier companies get good money for quick delivery of goods. Often time is very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some lines, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem on other lines and small companies.
If they sent goods by freight plane, on some routes they could spend a few days in the completion of unloading and customs.
The only way to do that faster was to send things like checked bags. According to airline regulations, you can't send a package without a related passenger, and here's the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a very thick package of bills for the privilege (or, even better, your company does it for you).
However, it is not cheap: according to a rough estimate, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual savings rate for the business class and eleven times for the first class!
Generally, it's not worth the effort to look for discounts for business seats or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinov. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were restored between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial center, located on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Between the wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers, traditional roofs of red bricks, 18th-century markets and old mosques and churches appear, but the atmosphere of the city is more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and on it is an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the church yard are interesting marble carvings of doves.
It's worth a half hour to walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was adopted by foreigners when Lord Byron praised its great merits.
The 403 bus line from Scotturb regularly runs to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, which is the site of world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place with almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their past here and there are still more people who have loved ones who have been killed or put to death there, whether Jews or not.
Please behave in the place with as much dignity, solemnity and respect as it fully deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't damage the place with markings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it and almost all speak Spanish.
But most of the posters are only in Catalan, because the law declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular advertisements are made only in Catalan, but the unplanned interruptions are advertised by an automatic system in a multitude of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have gained a reputation for being self-centered, unkind and proud people.
This is often just an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to keep smooth relations with Parisians is to behave best as if you are bien élevé (well educated). This will make the journey much easier.
The abrupt ways of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of bays, pice and abyss, and it features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the range of microclimates, diverse terrain and different altitudes.
The region is also home to an extremely diverse range of animals and bird species.
There you can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, roaches, lynxes, wild cats and uruguas, in addition to many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts up to the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do supply laundry to women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own laundry, especially if it is brightly colored.
Similarly, men must wear trousers up to their knees.
You can also borrow this from the storage room at the entrance, but you don't wash those clothes after every use, and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. There is one measure for all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available additives, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie with the meaning you, always begins in the capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier, too, but writing gets a little more complicated because you need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in the substantive form.
Pronouncing is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters of note are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the subsequent vowel.
Also, you have to pronounce r and rr differently: tsar means dear, while carro means chariot.
The grammar of Persian is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
So reading this grammar introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It is unnecessary to say that if you speak a Romanian language, it will make learning Portuguese easier.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it is not worth learning it separately.
Generally, pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and they remain as museums or educational institutions.
Because then light pollution wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, it's generally in cities or universities, places that are more easily accessible than those where they're built in modern times.
The most modern telescopes for exploration are huge installations in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Looking at cherry blossoms, also known as hanami, has been part of Japan's culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where a prune flower was the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor only for himself and for other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Because plants look best in a natural environment, don't give in to the temptation to remove samples, not even one.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting specimens will also lead to your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to explore. Once you get there, you can buy almost anything.
But still, because you're in the warm tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you're going to have to fight the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to use goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for holidays.
For example, you could visit castles in the Loverval or the Rhineval, or go on a cruise ship to interesting towns on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also specify routes of known hiking and biking routes.
Christmas is among the most important festivals of Christianity. It celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere in the world have adopted many of the traditions of this holiday.
Traditionally, people spend the Easter night sleepless outside to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold a Easter vigil and the parishes begin to celebrate just after midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first arrived on the island came swimming, flying, or swimming.
Because of the long distance between the islands and the continent, mammals could not make such a journey and so the giant turtle became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance of seeing the northern sunrise, because the sky will be dark almost always.
You can also enjoy the stars, because these regions are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than one to which Westerners may be accustomed.
Costumes are the standard workwear and employees address each other by surnames or job titles.
Workplace harmony is paramount, as is emphasis on group striving rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers usually must get the approval of their bosses for all decisions made and they must obey the instructions without question.
