European inflation slipped into food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the skyrocketing food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg-based Union Statistical Office announced.
Official forecasts put the probability at only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, did not cut the basic interest rate, on the pretext that the decrease, together with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation in Germany, at 3.3 percent, broke the twelve-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area soared as a result of soaring food and energy prices.
Wheat futures increased by 88 percent and soybean futures reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, vegetable oil and dairy products had to pay much more in 2007.
The price of crude oil on the world market has risen this year by 52 percent, with the price of black gold reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, while in 2009 it will already fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December support for the Young Democrats Alliance rose significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - for the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the Socialist electors for the parties - due to the greater firmness of the electors for the opposition - would mean support for more than two thirds (71%) compared to support for a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary scans: their support within the totality of the population is two percent.
Among the confident voters there is one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the more hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
As for the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to worsen and only a tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, higher than any previous Gallup poll, felt that the Prime Minister is doing more badly than good.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or trusted by 13 percent of those polled, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those polled.
54% of the population do not trust the Head of Government at all and 27% do not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
Whereas after the October riots last year 35% thought it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is now only 20%, with a relative majority (33%) believing that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question on participation answered that they would certainly participate and another 20 percent said they were likely to participate.
In comparison, only 55% of the population would be confident in participating in "a general election to be held this Sunday" and another 15% believe it likely.
74% of the population would disapprove of paying for tuition fees, 79% for medical consultations and 84% for hospital treatment.
If we look at these proportions only among the insured participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has increased its prices fivefold
The average price increase of 16% was maintained by the hypermarkets in the Budaörs gold trade triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial golden triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets was registered a growth much higher than one thousand HUF.
As in December last year had already "disappeared" prices in the supermarkets of food, so did not experience a drastic increase in price percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously scary for consumers that what they could buy last year for far less than HUF 9 000, they cannot do today for even HUF 10 000.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 this basket was worth HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liqueur and fish remained almost at the same level as in the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in the price of turkey breast, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to below HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with two-liter redemptible bottle cost less than HUF 200, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only HUF 257.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket, she was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15%, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18% the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was HUF 1480 per year.
Last year the average price increase was HUF 1206, so that during Christmas last year the VAT increase was felt in the prices.
It was this process that destroyed commerce, the supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price range to be applied to each product and to calculate the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of a product poorly, he may lose a significant profit on the margin adjusted to the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive basket was HUF 1720 higher than the value recorded in 2006, while the difference in the cheapest basket was only HUF 844.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price now has been HUF 1630 more than last year and the lowest price also increased by HUF 1284.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices in less than 20 months, with the price of basic consumer goods rising by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some basic foodstuffs, recorded over the 12 month period a price increase of more than 30 per cent.
So for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case, only a 10 per cent increase in prices.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the situation in the Community, which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The hypermarkets don't complain in the golden commercial triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
In our experience, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy large quantities of all products, carrying along preserved food on pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores were lined up in front of the checkout boxes because the number of customers had suddenly increased.
However, we have information that sales volumes are lower within the country, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals, you save money on disinfectants.
This year, several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowded beds and staff overload do not help control infections, says the chief doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants are being used sparingly.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
A man hospitalized after a serious accident was found to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred at this same hospital earlier this year.
A man who was injured in a serious car accident was discharged from hospital and the same patient had to return to hospital shortly afterwards as a result of MRSA infection and since then no major surgery has been possible because of the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, chief of department of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that hospitals have certainly recorded this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents, but no other information is available.
Nearly two thirds of infections (683 cases) are caused by MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any illness.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once over- or mis-applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become highly antibiotic-resistant and spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or septicemia in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened bodies, in the elderly or in people with low body weight.
In the opinion of the chief physician of the János Hospital there is nothing special about the infection of MRSA, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff attend them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are screened for MRSA in advance, but even this cannot prevent infection in all cases.
It's not in fashion to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital conditions are not conducive to the prevention of formation and contagion with the multidrug-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine inpatients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA in their system.
However, microbiological sampling is not a trend in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections already occur visible in the patient", said the head doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict guidelines for the use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for the treatment of infections and diseases.
It is important to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in outpatients or in basic care", said Karolina Böröcz.
It saves on the disinfectants.
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Handwashing, the use of rubber gloves and masks therefore play a very important role, but there are also considerable shortcomings in this respect in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital wards are often crowded, beds often close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least five feet [1.5 m].
Unfortunately, it can also be seen - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favourable economic conditions, disinfectants are used sparingly, there are few nurses and many patients, and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
Karolina Böröcz believes that where appropriate prevention measures are in place, fewer such infections are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme seems to be successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol test for police chief who caused a fatal accident.
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
It can be ruled out that the dismissed district police commander of the XXII district was driving drunk or in a daze, who on Tuesday hit and killed a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol test which had already established that the former police commander had not consumed any alcoholic beverage before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when turning to Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district hit a man of 55 years, who wanted to cross the street, but not in the designated area for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code is not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way to the bending.)
The bystander died after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander had cooperated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation from the beginning.
€400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Minister of Finance, János Veres, and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Marta Gajecka, signed in Budapest on Friday three credit-limit agreements totalling 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, which will be carried out from the Cohesion Fund grant, for which the parties had already previously signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this Hungarian objective, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided upon later, when extending the loan agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euro for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
The talks also covered the construction of the fourth line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalized the details of the Metro financing with the EU, they would again address the issue of whether or not to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place as early as the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary, worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is EURIBOR-compliant and the EIB offers a grace period of eight years, with no commission for keeping the loan at the debtor's disposal.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's still cheaper market, which will soon become more expensive?
The Bulgarian division of Re/Max was analysed.
The preferred destination for property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - like Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap Rus area.
The capital Sofia can also be attractive, with commercial and office spaces promising a quick return on investment.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe, and can thus be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
So, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
Analysts believe that those who buy property in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are British, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian clients on the Black Sea beaches and in skiing paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and they value the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category is comprised of chalet buyers (Bulgaria was in the top 10 holiday destinations for Germans in December).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital-based real estate is rising steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, over the last five years, real estate prices have increased by 21 percent annually.
The increase in real estate prices considerably outstrips the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Hundred Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration, the negotiations at minister level on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, which runs until 2012.
There are now lively discussions on this subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate precise figures at the moment, although it is inclined to agree that emissions of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990.
Another big issue at the conference is whether or not the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
The Council also agreed on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by a 16-member board of directors, likely from the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes "Piac és Profit".
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 regardless of whether the 'post-2012 agreement' is signed and is ready to commit to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibilities and capabilities.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the existing EU-wide system of taxation to include the taxation of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Hungarian commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared with the period between 1985 and 1987, which our country will comply with, says the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, where the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed in two years' time, otherwise its entry into force will be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce emissions made in the Kyoto Protocol will not be immediately followed by a new international system for reducing emissions, the need for which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN's international scientific association dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and prevent an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth, which, according to scientists, would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
British Army units in a video distributor post footage of action filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British air force (RAD) was the first to take advantage of YouTube services: Special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are monitored at the Kandahar general operations corps, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been viewed by over 75 thousand people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true purpose of the British Army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs next to nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - but it inevitably has a political message, as it justifies the government's military actions in a specific way.
The Americans have prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recordings that have been carefully edited and censored, amateur videos, for example about the death of soldiers, also appear in the distributor: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers talk about losses at most, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
Moreover, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos of actual operations have already been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form of recruitment with free-to-download shooter games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put themselves directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to bid farewell to the year 2007 with a little salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power is amused.
State offices are also getting ready for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and on the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of the soldiers currently on missions abroad will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a lavish party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of HUF 4 320 000 and of the 600 employees of the ministry, approximately 350 are expected to attend.
The Christmas party will be held in the carpet, with artists and raffle.
The ANF Christmas cost HUF 4 700 000 and was held on Wednesday at the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with music concerts and dinner.
The room's rent cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a contest management company called the Hungarian Center for Economic Development Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Theatre of Comedy.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to contact the person responsible.
You can attend without clothes
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucía on December 7.
Their CNAJ didn't charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's greeting words and after dinner there was live dance music.
In answer to [origo's] question, they reported: to attend the ball it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, labour and local government portfolios are preparing for a modest celebration.
The Ministry of Public Health will organise a programme and a party for its employees in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth, on the other hand, is not expecting her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a year-end work meeting.
The press department said that 180 guests were expected to attend, and that they would only have coffee and a small salty pastry, so the party would not cost more than HUF 350 000.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the buffet reception and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres has been minister, the MF workers have been celebrating Christmas in the same way every year.
The official character of the event will be given not only by the ministerial speech but also by the timetable of the evening.
The Agriculture Ministry will be hosting a New Year's reception on January 20th, and the Ministry will not be hosting a Christmas reception.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple standing reception, to which only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas celebration - this is what the corresponding press departments have communicated to [origo].
The press department of the environment portfolio could not provide information on the budget for the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
It is known that over four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers Committees will form a strike committee on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday which will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon the League Unions will inform about the details of their strike on Monday which they will hold together with the National Federation of Workers Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be formed to coordinate the actions on Monday.
On Saturday there will be a protest rally, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike for an indefinite period, if an agreement is not reached with the government.
That is to say, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not inform the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapprove the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday, it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on in the very late hours of the night, or at best close to midnight.
As a result of the strike which will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: the railways will be closed indefinitely, and in the morning part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of the inter-city bus transport of the Volán companies may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil society organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's Web page.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period, others for a definite period.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railroad and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 pm, the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 am, will hold a four-hour strike, the LIGA Electrical and Thermal Industry Unions, the Teachers' Unions called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Teachers' Union from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be calling a national strike at alternate times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which is part of the Forum of Trade Union Cooperation, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that the new way of calculating pensions, which will come into force next year, be introduced gradually.
The third is that they should ensure, even before 2010, that, in the case of early retirement, the occupations which deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidings and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The company's 'risk warning' states that the greatest political risk in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity is the fact that 'with the aggravation of the existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur'.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be the provocation of an event of this nature, the representative of the research institute added.
They said that this was due to one of the main failings of the main actors of Hungarian political life: "the main actors of public life gave the public debate on the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, empowers extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict - they estimate.
In addition to that, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that: from the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and momentum and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations that call themselves "national self-defense associations" have been established in the country.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the State" - they add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method which tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
The emphasis on civil and associational forms in the case of these associations not only avoids the legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring states they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this has an influence on the political stability of the region' they added.
The establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, according to the Institute of Investigation, and political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in a similar way to the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass unrest of the Roma that occurred in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to form the guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Bulgarian Gypsy organizations have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the gypsies in Hungary will also react to the threat in a similar way, organising their own self-defence - as can be read in the warning on the risks of Political Capital.
The director of research at Political Capital, Attila Juhász, responded to the news agency's question by saying that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The party doesn't always have red numbers.
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the public holidays - which next year will be fewer - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian laws make a distinction between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The holidays are fundamentally related to religious and historical holidays.
Let us celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are holidays - the latter especially so that those who have spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven festivals written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on 23 October, the day commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1 the holiday of labor, on November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day festivals: Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Depending on the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often a bridge when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for the extended weekends, the Saturdays before the weekends cannot be missed from work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when work is to be done exactly in exchange for the day immediately preceding or following the holiday.
This legal provision is binding on all employers and their employees, as well as on employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for service companies and institutions which, because of their function, work continuously even during the public holidays.
This year the work schedule can only be altered around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December onwards, life in the country practically stops, since according to experience, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year, many of our holidays will coincide with weekends or weekdays, so there will be fewer changes in working hours than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified around the work holiday so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2nd will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, work will be required instead of Friday 24th.
On the other hand, next year during the end-of-year holiday you will be able to rest, since from December 24 onwards you will not work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to make your colleagues' lives bitter.
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that pass us by without us realizing it: they are all part of our daily workplace folklore.
You have to decide whether you will adapt to the small annoyances or consciously avoid the confusing situations that may irritate others.
Counsel.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you that the marketing department is looking for you" - says one of your colleagues".
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, he feels it and tries to fix it, maybe even calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to give you the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before you go on with your lame explanations, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things that you can do to make your colleagues' lives bitter and make a conscious effort to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, a desk tool or your phone and you can't find it.
Do you remember that yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it was gone?
Did you find your missing pen in the desk of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking, for they will rightly be angry with you for taking their things.
Don't take envelopes or post-its from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
You gossip about the private lives of your colleagues?
There's no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not share information (guesses) you have about the private lives of your colleagues with everyone!
Do not abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know his things.
You're taking sick leave without a reason?
When you call the office and say you're sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; think that others must do your work, your taxable tasks, your work to finish.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you should stay at home, communicate, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to deal with your absence the next day.
Jumps, laughs, phone calls
Are you in the middle of your work, but are you suddenly taken out of it by the ridicule of your colleagues?
Have you unwittingly overheard a telephone conversation that you would have been better off not overhearing?
Don't annoy your colleagues with your humming, singing, loud conversations (except when you do it above their heads), kicking, constant blasphemies, voicing your discontents out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not currently delving into a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Do not blame others if you have not finished something on time, forgotten to send an important letter or message!
You are not referring to the chaos that may be in the office, nor to the noise your colleagues make!
You must admit if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must make up for it!
Ask how you can make up for your mistake!
Do you feel too at home at the office?
Jogging shoes and slippers: very comfortable for the home, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear a comfortable jogging suit even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the public's expectations.
The car is moving slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
A strange beat is playing on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'll turn up the volume.
He changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous notes he adds the bass and then the voice of a female choir like a real jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But it looks totally different now this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Some new and interesting songs from the national underground [b2]digital [b3] are gradually changing the image and although again the garage rock is in fashion, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematográficos (pl.
The Commission has not yet adopted the draft decision.
The wider public became aware of the ensemble that initially only acted in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they wear this label with pleasure.
The band reacted as they should: they prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will open new paths for them, although the title itself intends to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, the reference to the flying is fine, but in addition to the airy of the music, there now appeared - in accordance with the spirit and the trend of the time - the guitar that sounds loudest, the rock and roll effect.
With these songs he presented the album in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the group The Puzzle.
The album includes a real hit of the channel mr2 Petõfi which lately broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station brought to the ears of the radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Well, everything is in order.
He asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: to what extent is the music you are playing dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
Zs: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has a much larger tradition.
There, not only the 15 and 20 year old generations frequent the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are happening around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they're from, and how many people are listening to your music?
BZs: It's a natural feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we've never written music for the market.
We don't write music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is felt most in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather west of us.
BZ: We don't follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We're more of a team, trusting each other's musical presence and letting it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
w.hu: In the list of hits of mr hv2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't intend to write big hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is about something more than that.
We added it to the end of the record, trying to relax after the orgy of the album sound and the heavier tracks.
hv.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why them - what was the main motive?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of the good-voiced soloists of our own national musical scene.
Thus was created that chorus of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hv.g.hu: Is this exactly how you wrote the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed long ago in an instrumental version and when we had already all the material of the album, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the song.
That night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came together on the first try and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and in the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for the brief solo of Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no more strongly than the music, so the music does not just accompany their singing.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
On purpose?
BZs: They're at the bottom for purely technical reasons.
But we consciously didn't want to distribute soloist roles.
The song is also about that, about forgetting for a while our ego, who we are, where we came from and where we are going, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to have made others feel the same euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you work on the most?
ZsB: In the composition of music, actually none, but when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert piano or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time the groove didn't want to work and then, little by little, everything fell into place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new record?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex.
A crooked thief.
This is what he says of his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, which also owns the Czech Commercial Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good capabilities.
He sensed long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile temper", was said by his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what is clear from Kerviel's answers, as translated by French media such as Le Monde, is that this was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of over 1,600 million euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank", he says in his answers.
Precisely, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, we started hearing some news about so-called sub-prime mortgages being offered to low-income customers or those who had trouble with payments in the past and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis was not to affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and he bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, his profits were over 1.6 billion euros.
"When I won my first 500 million, I didn't know how to notify him", Kerviel confesses, adding that he has left nothing for himself, not at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he testified that he had falsified the records in such a way that they were not discovered.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even as the Eurex Exchange became interested in his business.
Risk turned to profit
Were you afraid that you would be found out?
No, not really.
"I thought I had won $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy".
Where did he get the willpower to take such a risk?
In my position, you had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000 and $60,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
I still knew I'd never make as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me cautiously.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal progress", Kerviel told the researchers.
But soon after I joined the company, the first big success came.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bombings in London, playing the downside a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a trigger mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you
"This is like a snowball", the police said.
But it is said that the leaders knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes".
Only, then, the blow came earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of you.
And how did they get a fix on him?
He became a suspect after his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the year that had passed.
The runner who doesn't have a holiday is a runner who doesn't want anyone to look at his file", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of achieving 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
The seven operational programmes will provide approximately 125 billion kroner for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure which next year will have the amount of 90.800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should seek funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the newly joined countries that are least likely to use EU funds.
Twenty years for former Nicaraguan president, court decrees
Nicaragua's Court of Appeals on Thursday handed down a 20-year sentence to the country's former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for embezzling $100 billion (nearly $1.8 billion).
However, some time later, he was released from prison to be put under house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan capital.
It is not clear at this moment, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on the prison officers whether they let Alemán finish his sentence at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German was constantly transferring government money to a company's account in Panama.
This company was fictitious and the account belonged, in reality, to his closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how they got our budget approved.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
What's so special about this budget?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, passed the new law calmly.
It is a great paradox.
Every government starts and ends with every chapter and item of the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they give it special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than just numbers.
The State budgets of the last Social Democratic governments suffered from three defects that for this year 2008 it is not possible to fix so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as of the expenditure of the mandataries that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public financing, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit in the State budget.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The ticking time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budgets.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from tax money, fees and bank loans, often issued, senselessly, bonds with which they indebted their town halls disproportionately.
In recent years they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They don't have this resource at the moment.
If we stick to the official and verified facts alone, we find that:
Our economy, for a few years now, has been going through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the finances of the State in order.
However, instead the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of a few such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, have been saving much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We are among the nations that are least threatened by poverty in global measures.
That is why we do not need the massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been blown up in the last few years with gigantic measures.
And even if they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and the pension reform are not changed soon then it will be the end really of any politics in this country and, whoever governs will be just a simple bureaucracy.
To exaggerate a bit, we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal expenditures from the expenses of the leaders.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the previous government had not squandered in the last ten years what they could.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become mere officials, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the tranquility to prepare other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.
The President of the Republic
Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be received in the money market through bidding.
In these auctions banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send out forty billion dollars to bid, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continuing growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his client report.
"This coordinated action by central banks likely reduced the U.S. recession from 65 percent to 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists are still expecting billions in losses.
"Central banks should really be afraid of what they have yet to do when they decided to take this step", said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of access to loans and that they will have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the US, Canadian and British central banks cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move by central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the slump in the US housing market.
Klaus: The debates of the environmentalists are amazing
Global climate change is particularly affecting developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now emerged with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of the environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference which creates a strange mixture of government and non-governmental representatives but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"The debates there are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President, during the presentation of his book, stressed that this is a very important subject for him and that is why he is interested in it.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said "often I only encounter the caricature of my ideas".
Now those interested can find out about his diverse opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
In the main part of the closing he expressed his view that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced in totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given the task of preparing a report on the implementation of the directive on the protection of the environment.
The same subject was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driver's licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers were overstayed and therefore did not manage to change their old driving licence which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that the officials give them until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without valid driving licenses.
According to traffic, the carnet has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of carnets, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and the interest in the new carnet has increased.
The town hall estimates about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a waiting line for half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet obtained their new driving licences.
It takes 20 days to issue a new card.
However, it is possible to apply for a licence within a shorter period than five days.
But in that case the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who are obliged to change their license and do not reach the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The cop can fix the violation with a warning.
If it is an administrative offence, the fine is 2500 kroner.
According to the information above, a person who doesn't go anywhere could be fined.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of a thousand crowns, at most.
According to the spokesman for the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of 1,000 kroner do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document on which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the identity card that every person should have valid.
People who don't want to drive should hand over their driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licence.
People with the document between the years 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentences of Berdych's accomplices.
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided to reduce the sentences to one year and two years.
The detectives from the Prague department of organized crime were originally supposed to serve between 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the Superior Court.
Berdych is also a defendant in this case, but he is the first to be sentenced by the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years in other trials.
He can't take any more.
In January, the district court admitted 19 people to the robbery and the superior court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused's accusations were rejected by the investigation as fabricated.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped the members of the criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge relates to the criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the robbery, its victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abusing their power as public officials and without weapons permits.
In the house search, police found some pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser pointer and a machine gun.
The criminal group, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for almost twenty men in this trial the court has already found Berdych and others guilty.
Other men connected to the Berdych case are still testifying in other trials, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their handover to the Czech authorities.
One account for a few children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve such a demand, it's too high", Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has any value.
We are of the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone", Dostal stressed.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for each month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million kroner.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only that it was drawn up in the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better endured by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women are worse off with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were switched by the nurses at the Třebič Maternity House last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls were returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákov family in Přibyslaví, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablonec.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each family 100,000 crowns at the end of October as compensation for the mistake made in the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In case of mistakes, they must draw from the reserve fund and in exceptional cases they can ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far awarded them a proportionately low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables are in the hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily in the million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the case over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity", said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
For him, the words Kingdom of Wallachia, to everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea is also Harabiš.
"We have had about ten years of work behind us.
Search for money and invention of activities" he said.
To him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something for it.
They want to live as parasites of our work", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polívka in her TV show.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it wasn't about orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use her name and signature on passports and even offered discounts to visitors to her farm and attendees of her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for her own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia", said the judge.
He added however that the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, between the now disintegrated parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that time on, there were conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the eternally chosen".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, was the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his company which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to give any further details or dates.
"We have no hurry.
It should be something like the King's Road to Moravia.
The king would have to be chosen on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can come forward" added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices are overcome
To tell you the truth, I never liked the Peugeot 206 very much.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is a successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think it over.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headrest space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters long.
Flying around the world
I'll go through the inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It's a sleek design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
I would value the design invention more, although here the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and the days of complaining about short seats and backs are long gone.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral direction has been improved considerably.
And the space, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
The Combi eliminates the aforementioned lack of space in the head.
Luggage to the hold
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
I must say that it is very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and well-spaced.
The dead spaces are fitted with rubber straps which make an ideal solution.
They are not annoying, and they can stretch to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the charts, in basic mode it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot is lagging behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
From vacation to overseas or placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I were to say something positive then I should mention the floor which is quite flat after the second line's supports have been removed.
120 horses in four gaits.
Our test car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1600 that belittles the familiar five-door should look like.
It's quiet, low-power, and most of all, it's got momentum.
Compared to the Škoda era, when it looked like the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that I'm impressed with this one.
Prices respond to
The price of the car is not for everyone's pockets.
We must, however, take into account that we have tested a vehicle with elegant equipment and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition from 1400 for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our adjusters put it at 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbags in the headlights, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the equipment add-ons in the Fabia and you'll come up with a pretty similar number.
Now it's just a matter of deciding which of the two brands to choose.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend and therefore, the locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is only bringing a number of problems for the time being.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrant and native children escalate into violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern town of Kent where conflicts between the native population and Slovak immigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brawling among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the police in Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In his defense he said the girl was insulting his son with racist slurs.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls assaulted him with racist insults and threw rocks at him.
"On our way home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he made the gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his butt", described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European emigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the atmosphere in English schools is becoming quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can be achieved, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy, golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
The palm trees and the whole enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the laya, ice cream or various cocktail dishes.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and more.
Only on one island does he find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the stronghold of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eyes have ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and a cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
It was ordered to be built by one of the American mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminality in the US (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, who was the first person to ever be nominated for an Oscar.
In Havana, tall buildings sprang up, and along wide avenues, cars ran, which were a cult symbol in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the world of show and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, they mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars, already cult cars of the 50s, still run through Havana today, because those Ladas and Fiats that arrived long ago have rusted in these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and is highly valued by railway enthusiasts.
Sugarcane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
Their coaches for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose models brothers that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most familiar place for most visitors remains unchanged.
And for that, there is no need to talk about Havana or Varadero anymore.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on limestone rocks.
The valley's slopes are lined with cliffs, limestone pilings and rocks from high places, and in their caves, fertile lands are acclimatized, forming rocky valleys that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories, you can find the final product.
It might be interesting to some that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
The Trinity
Old Abolengo town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and fortune.
Wealth became beauty with the construction in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French colonists who arrived later, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so isolated that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that connected it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the way.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for everyone was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to spend in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth visiting interesting places in the immediate surroundings, such as Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Mills.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which lifts the silence of the mornings with its music.
Other
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that view is already confirmed by the road itself.
The two roads leading there from Guantánamo must pass through high, rugged mountains, as well as through a nature that knows little of man's action.
This eastern part of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its unspoiled nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pines, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, Santería, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, of all this could fill many pages.
But as they say, it's better to see it sometime.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, say the Americans
Few troops and insufficient equipment are what is affecting the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO, according to the US Secretary of Defence, Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working out as planned, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as the conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase their activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to empower the population so that they can start economic development and security on their own", Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent of the time
The Afghan rebels' activity is higher than it has been in the past five years, according to the US military.
The number of violent actions grew by 27 percent compared to last year, and in Helmand province by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of them in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They're exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them", Gates said.
The same was said today by the Secretary-General of NATO, Mr Jaap de Hoop.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on the ground and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The debate among the countries attending the conference in recent months has been whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for being passive.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of fighting there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country", Gates said.
The tabloid newspaper The Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans are playing while our boys are fighting", Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph of British troops playing a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will reach one trillion in 2009
For each cheque the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt in September was 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improving economy of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt from early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Last year the state borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could pass the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and one billion crowns" said for the server iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
The same view is shared by Next Finance economist Vladimir Pikora: "We could pass the billion mark in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If you saw that the situation on the political scene changed and the politicians were able to save, then you could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don't see any change", he added.
Doubt is growing
State debt creates debt in the central government and arises primarily from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state debt is paid for by means of Treasury bonds, State bonds, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt has now grown from 1.700 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion crowns and since June has been reduced by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average maturity of the government debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total interannual debt from the first to the third quarter is up 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mostly from liabilities where there is 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt is growing but on the other hand it shows with what it is going to negotiate until there is a reform of the pensions" commented Pikora.
Better than expected
The strategy for the payment and management of the state debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
In early December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.800 million kronor due to improved state budget developments.
The amount is mainly composed of the state budget deficit which this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of about CZK 13,3 billion, the pension payment reserve of CZK 10 billion, CZK 43 billion to finance state obligations and CZK 1,8 billion in loan repayments from the European Investment Bank.
He was appearing today in a court in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of letting pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
He was liable to a lashing penalty.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher, who teaches at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and sedition under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6 or 7, to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", says the school's headmaster Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 of the 23 children have chosen Muhammad as their preferred name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but it's also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that the depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm just sorry that she asked the children to vote for a name", it was according to him just an "innocent mistake".
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class"..
Let's remember that the name Mohammed is also the second most common name in Britain, spelled in 14 different ways in English.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the province's future status during the last session of negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final round of talks on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, having failed to resolve their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute", said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
The European Union is also calling on the EU to take action to help the countries of the region, and to support the efforts of the international community to achieve a peaceful settlement.
"We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period", he added, noting that "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the UN last August.
The Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West considers independence under European Union supervision the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached", announced the president of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where the "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has expressed some of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to killings and deportations".
" The domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic said that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade says it is particularly afraid of a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible".
The EU is also calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners and for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
'Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia', Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had said.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sedjiu had responded to journalists that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made "in concert" with the West.
Bush starts an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement to the 60-year-old point of contention between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
The EU's position on the Middle East is that the EU should be able to take action against the Palestinians in the Middle East, and that the EU should be able to take action against the Palestinians in the Middle East.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including the core issues".
The term covers the three main thorny issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among other things".
The European Union is also supporting the efforts of the United States to establish a global nuclear arsenal and to establish a nuclear-armed force.
The European Union has a duty to ensure that the European Union is able to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty of Rome.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment to this from Bush before he decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose involvement in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the forefront of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saoud said in his interview with the Arabic newspaper with Saudi capitals.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in these events, official accounts and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the French national police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on the rue Luisa-Miguel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but on patrol, and was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating light", explains a police source.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "not approved, that is not authorized to ride on public roads" (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, was riding "at full speed".
"He hit the police car on the left, after a breach of the right-hand pass", the police said.
The alcohol test carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The car's condition (the front part smashed, windshield cracked, bumper ripped) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into "incidents of involuntary homicide and refusal of assistance" to the IGPN, in conjunction with the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-bike came relatively quickly to his left".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the socks on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been pinned in time for the police car to reach the brake.
The vehicles have been impounded and are to be subjected to a technical examination.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor spread in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene too quickly, thus failing to help the two young men.
The IGPN would also, in a prudent spirit, exclude "any serious misconduct" on this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, on which we must be very cautious", said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that precisely faces the scene.
"We went down with my cousin, who is a nurse, to the hospital to try to revive them", this witness says.
There was nothing to do".
Then he saw a policeman completely unafraid, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone".
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived on the scene.
According to this witness, the rescuers arrived "about twenty minutes after the police departed".
They also practiced heart massages, but to no avail.
"I will not allow myself to assume that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young men have been rescued.
The fire department was there right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the imposition of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, around 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone-throwing, injuring police.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday drew support from the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste to those who took the oath before Musharraf".
" Musharraf 's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He was to pronounce in the coming days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf to the presidential elections on 6 October by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we are seeing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings", the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "is no longer valid" after the imposition of the state of emergency, he told Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This calculation takes into account unintended pregnancies (24%) and births that were poorly planned or unexpected.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law was passed, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile pill still have a failure rate of 5 to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has however allowed for better "fertility management", according to the institute which notes that the pill use rate among women aged 20 to 44 has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple of five and if possible for the spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members on the International Space Station (ISS) to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is indispensable to the continuing scientific activities of the station.
A risky departure that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "hatched" by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when the astronauts had released from the Discovery spacecraft the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece that will soon be used by European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing pad for the laboratory modules.
But we have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5-tonne solar-power module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began rearranging the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 250 feet (76 m).
And that's where one of the panels, which unfurls like accordions, has been damaged by a little over or under a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to make a control exit from the shuttle Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to go sniff around the end of the 100-foot-long arm of the shuttle added to the station to make the repairs.
He is one of NASA's top spacewalkers.
Tall, tough, very dexterous, with a well-developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor-in-training has been tasked with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After having inspected the damage accurately, he cut the faulty cable and installed "tablet" types in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second spacewalker who had stayed close to the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulation to prevent electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "shaped" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the station interior.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were taking advantage of a midday rest before today, seven astronauts return from the shuttle Discovery for their scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS security is listed on the Stock Exchange
EADS stock is currently down sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS is down 4%, to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris stock exchange.
The group was forced to revise its forecast for operating results for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is required for the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The cost of overcoming the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to 'between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euro, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
The Commission's decision to open the formal investigation procedure was based on the information provided by the complainant, which was not provided by the complainant.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new cargoes is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very thick A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group envisaged a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the polls: Russians are going to massively vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed voters today in a televised message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be seen by receiving the foreign ambassadors, content to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest elections, more transparent and more open, elections without incidents", he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Zyuganov says that there has "never been such a dirty election, even in Yeltsin's time".
After the crackdown on last weekend's demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to seek a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, in the legislative elections as in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel they are masters of their destiny", says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further back: civil society was delayed in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief", believes Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "voluntarily renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's the point of reflecting?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians not voting for extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen Nazi files, which describe the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not until now only available for 'humanitarian' purposes, that is to say individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states responsible for its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement by all the States has been completed, the opening is effective from yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research "particularly on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or of detention orders issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find deported or forced labourers and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees at Bad Arolsen handle tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents", declared Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral Indo-European trade is already worth about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The European Union's foreign ministers gave the European Commission its approval last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th largest trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
The EU's trade policy is based on the principle of free trade and the principle of non-discrimination.
The European Commissioner said that Europe was the first or second market for each of India's top ten export products. The Asian and European giants exchange "47 billion euros of goods" and "ten billion euros of services" annually, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, had said this week, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential".

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was anxious to ease the current backlash of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a £10 billion offer at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusually long offer.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve provision during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks", it said in a statement.
The bank said that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) would be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate, until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the Bank of England BoE puts in the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "prepared to take further action to keep the indices" of interbank lending up to date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had dissuaded banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny the examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
The resolution also calls for the creation of a European Union-wide network of contacts between the Member States and the Commission, with a view to promoting the exchange of information and experience between them.
Since UMP and NC voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes against 115), the sitting was adjourned at the end of the general debate which resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and the opposition after a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft of rectificative finance examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic's British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, nothing more, nothing less, the current festival movement in America", C3's Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival was to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitud Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also taken over the production, licensing and organisational duties of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the heart of Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we've become stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional location which, lately, will take place in Philadelphia".
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after having been out of the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European Melvin Benn model is a country festival, whereas ours are more urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at once an impression of a country festival in the European way and an urban festival in the American way".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the celebration of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, we hope, will have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer at this festival is "too big", like the 80,000-person Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
"Vineland will have the rock flavour, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators", says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal takes on the Terminator
It's not easy to lure the plates of Hollywood movies to Montreal when nothing but Terminator is opposed to that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governator?
"We have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best", he says.
The race to festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the cinema here.
The race to the Oscars has begun.
All the West Coast festivals, whether it's Sundance or Denver or Seattle or San Francisco, will have to showcase Quebec films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is playing in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market?
With less than five weeks to go before the close of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not so clear that it will be produced.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasting on the basis of statistics alone is not appropriate, especially as uncertainties are looming in the markets in the current context, at least in the short term.'
Although they are not in favour of the stock market going limp in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality securities both in the long and short trades".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will behave rather laterally, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decrease in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulation of inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees that it's not a good time to venture to say that there's going to be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys", the expert says.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the highs recorded on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Not all experts have this negative view, however.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year since he believes that the rally will be moved forward to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that the volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, believes that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year is for the big values".
The expert would include the two big banks and some construction companies in the portfolio "because when the time comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, says the increases will come from the banking and industrial sectors.
The manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, should it ever happen.
"ACS has been recovering for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit", the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be the main driver in the latter part of the year due to increased sales in the holiday shopping season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, only twice has December been a bearish month.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the tech bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a rebound of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 of them are located in the most commercially important areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
The other Spanish institutions are also in favour of this, as they are the first to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 8.30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Another group which has also repeatedly stated that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he's about to close a deal with the unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for whether other entities will join this initiative that changes the hours of the shops.
This is precisely the objective Popular is pursuing with the project.
Capture the private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of the existing ones.
To this end, the bank will modernise the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers in the different streets.
The extension of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more modern design with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not imply a large investment, although a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operating under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very extensive hours, even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external personnel to the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We did it.
That was how Paolo Vasile, the CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the market's close, when he noted that the network he runs was doubling the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect clouded his joy: 'it hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have come down less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54 percent lead.
That gain puts your loss so far this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with a 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday lost 1.52% and has accumulated a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518,53 million Prisa (editor of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television network to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this figure is confirmed, the television network would record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
Net turnover from Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million), while net television revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the better relative evolution in the Telecinco stock market is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is too early to make a decision, this ratio could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we'll be able to keep our shareholders happy, who we've already given value to with 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
This is explained by the fact that it cut the forecast revenue growth from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3's profit forecast by 4,5% in 2008 and by 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
Two, please.
Caja Madrid: better views Telecinco (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintain) because of the 'attractive multiples' and the rise in business.
The third.
JPMorgan: recommends to weigh in both cases having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which came into force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to guarantee the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of entities so that markets can operate efficiently.
The MiFID, which amends the Securities Market Act, modernises financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (FSI), financial advisory firms (FAs), which will be joined by securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that the regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems, which will compete with the current stock exchange operators.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose to the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management practices and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Committee on the Economy of the Congress, several amendments were incorporated, among which it is noteworthy that secured debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to define the legal boundaries of the functions that graduates in economics and business can perform 30 years after the Royal Decree of 1977 delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for someone else, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of product marketing and customer acquisition to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised CPI increases by five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it in the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an overview of how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with Eurostat's and the European Central Bank's (ECB) policy of providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The forward indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "even if the figure is not good" the differential of inflation in Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not count on such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%", the Economy Minister said of the data released today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros in three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen more than 50% to £12 billion since it ran into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, it had a record of over 25,000 million pounds in deposits, a figure that has fallen steadily in two and a half months because of the distrust of its customers and despite the hundred percent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity to its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks to be deposited over the next three years to get that remaining £18 billion to reach the 30 billion target.
The group of the tycoon Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium bid, which includes three other companies, as its preferred bid to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested today at the early hours of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the town hall and the head of the police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then the town's mayor, and according to sources of the investigation consulted by the Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers are still searching the municipal offices and the Urbanism office and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore aforado, was detained leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urbanistic agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if the Socialists win
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the Government and general secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the ex-minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also said that "it seems" that the Manchurian politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who made public his decision on November 15 not to run in the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he does get the job, Bono hopes to make the House "the house of respect, not of insult or shouting", and make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government was interrupted in the Senate 26 times".
He has also praised the current president, Manuel Marín, for his "good work" and has not wanted to be seen occupying his post in order not to fall into what he said his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate and other publicity
As the climate change movement is subjecting both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to relentless persecution, it is obliged to show iron-clad consistency.
And a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why your government's action or inaction has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why your government, the one with the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
It also requires you to explain to the Spanish people as clearly as possible what measures you are going to take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what citizens' habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who's gonna sacrifice and who's gonna pay to save the planet.
But there have been no such explanations and there will be none.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to corporate and individual accounts.
Even the penny of petrol suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
So it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new appointments.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for the election campaigns that he does not speak or denounce or demand, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is a virtual contracting party and does not expect us to ride a bicycle or to cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana were arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hostel businessman for possible urbanistic crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been taken to the Consistory, where he is currently with numerous agents, who have also come to the Urban Planning Council and the municipal company for the management of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests add to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the sumary, which instructs the Courthouse No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees were released today.
As reported by the sources, the former regidor of Totana and today autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current girlfriend of the former regidor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman from Vigo Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the Group, through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crime Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana at the time, namely the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
Grupo Nuaria was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that was requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigues car parks of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando the Catholic; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that happen
The first.
If you don't mind, we'll put the Book of the Month thing on hold, see if we can think of another "premiology" and other competitions in the meantime.
I'm already working on something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
The second.
Our Finnish correspondent provides this comment from yesterday's edition of the leading Finnish newspaper (which, by the way, is the leader of the PISA report on the world's educational level), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what was published on November 18, the same day that Blackburn's book review, curiously enough, appeared there:
"The contents of the Philosophy signature have leapt to public opinion as a result of the Jokela school tragedy.
The culprit of the murders, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Minister of Education in charge of the Philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the basic compulsory course of Philosophy in the institutes".
3. the
A colleague shares information about the introduction of Internet downloading crimes in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a felony punishable by six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal from the store records worth less than 400 euros, it is considered as simple fault (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from a shop up to 1,000 euros, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the one imposed on the unloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than the unloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to engage in a fight than to engage in the exchange of compacts.
Engaging in a tumultuous brawl carries a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would carry a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the author's permission is punished more severely than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's losing their hand, a very long one.
Fourth.
My doctor at home dropped me one of his articles on rare research entitled, "Money produces brain activation, especially if others receive less".
So the feelings generated by the monthly wages of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out by magnetic tomography (MRI) at the University of Bonn and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Imaging Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers found that if both of them got the same pay when they hit, the activation was moderate, but if one got twice as much, the activation was higher.
I don't know if it took that much science to make that conclusion.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years now, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the office of the Prosecutor of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a sour taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on that list, from which the title of the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) is taken. The documentary, in the style of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is good for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible accidents, is a major expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
The fact is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is set taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the car, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident, the higher the premium.
That is why both men and women over 25 have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a lower accident rate because of their prudence.
Also, using the figures, the companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency and thus the likelihood of any mishaps.
The higher the frequency, the higher the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium rate.
Therefore, the driver should study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
The most important variables for choosing one or the other type of insurance are explained here, so that it not only adapts to the characteristics of the insured person, but also offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face various difficulties in obtaining affordable insurance, such as limited driving experience and old driving licences.
Although all-risk insurance is the ideal way to be well insured, there are other, more economical options.
More cautious drivers can opt for a deductible all-risk policy, so that they get the coverage of a full-risk policy but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would involve the customer paying part of the amount of the loss.
"The part of the loss amount that the customer contributes will be pre-established depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", says Luis Noguera, chief executive officer in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is protected against damage caused to third parties, but not against damage caused to his own car.
Plus, you'd be covered for theft, fire and loss of vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus and may reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that basic rate.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses", Noguera explains.
After 25 years of age, drivers have an easier time buying insurance, since the accident rate is reduced by the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is advisable to contract an all-risk franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience they have acquired in the past when it comes to accidents, or even driving", says the Spanish director of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, after the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is preferable to negotiate an all-risk insurance, as long as his financial situation allows it, of course.
The insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the public with the lowest number of claims, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a fully-funded one (which could be 300 euros) or, if there is a high level of premium, a third-party one extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They drive more leisurely and have more purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise", says Luis Noguera.
For retired people, a full-risk insurance with a deductible (of EUR 150) or an extended third party insurance is recommended if the premium is high.
Car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents, but also because it represents a major expense.
Celtic looking for a point in Milan worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the 'Champions' league, since the Italians serve them to be first and the Scots to sentenciar their classification.
The Italians have ten points and have already certified their pass with a draw in Portugal on the fifth day, while Celtic have nine points, but still need another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and Benfica, who have four, do not get ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of the 16.
So this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's team could even use a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar do not win, but can not be trusted because at nine points equality the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
The Milan players will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who hope to get into the round of 16 for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated in that round last season with a goal by Kaka in extra time (1-0) after 0-0 of the first.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the triumph, in the case of losing the Celtic, both to get into eighth and to remain in the UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have kicked off in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the reunion of the group is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out the concert, which included a video telling the story of the group that made headlines in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that collected his major hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain was published by EMI.
The five Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets given to them by Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that covered the GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria's nerves had forbidden him days before.
In the preview of the show's opening, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our costumes, at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" led to the quintet's dissolution two years later, also expressed their nervousness during a press meeting, two hours before the show started.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision", Chisholm said of the group's reunion that she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled and we all love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines flight.
When they arrived at the airport, they were met by an army of nurses.
Between the five of them, they have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (on December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They'll be performing in Madrid on December 23rd.
New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia's export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is routed through Ukraine, so every touch between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
A previous dispute last year cut supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on how much money Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom has said it will charge Ukraine more, as it has committed to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit during the talks", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
The last big gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
NHS "must test foreign workers"
Scotland's NHS needs to check the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
The recommendation by Auditor General Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no idea exactly how many foreign staff it has.
However, its report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area, following the attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged UK car bombings.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the health board of Scotland uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The Auditor-General's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should have the Criminal Records Bureau's guidance, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review", the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of foreign staff in the NHS".
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is", he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures set by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely followed.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualifications checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidance for pre-employment of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon states: "I had a great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He said that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the updating of the pre-employment screening guidelines for all work groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Film.
Trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, to director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes from a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black and white film, which features the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced on a budget of just £3,000.
But the winner was also the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of the Joshua Tree album of U2, awarded with two awards - best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film at the ceremony - Julien Temple's film about The Clash frontman Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a chauffeur for a Russian mafia boss in London in David Cronenberg's film Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough, was awarded the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifty-something, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me", he said.
"I was fortunate to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor".
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State TV from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
An eight-man cell of foreigners was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities at Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants fighting allied forces and backing the Shia Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the more extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants have targeted many clerics in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by calls from Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden to harass the country's pro-Western government - targeted residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work", the spokesman for the interior minister told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus's climate may give a glimpse into Earth's future
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is sufficient to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency's Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a glimpse of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the University of Oxford Physics Department and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago".
Police confiscate "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not dignified for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters videotape questions and send them for broadcast among the candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday afternoon, November 28th, were more ridiculous than the snow monkey asking the Democrats about global warming in the Republican Party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in the run-up to next year's elections.
It's not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose the YouTube videos to show the would-be candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The most poignant exchange of words of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been leading in the crucial polls of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation for being soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidates could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, came to terms on the issue.
Neither has the floor to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both raised the issue of immigration before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased surveillance at the borders, intolerance towards illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of toxic toys from China and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget about, or minimize, the divisions between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues came up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed at Jesus being too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul and his heated remarks from Wednesday's debate.
They both came out from under, because the two wings of the party couldn't agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labor pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to sink into; but he still emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
There's no sign of any influence swaps, or exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, or extramarital finger-sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour Party of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not report him.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing wit, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million pieces of personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it's the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is walking irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new pack takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start failing; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seeks out bad news; and the government gets defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
As much as I'd like to disown Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The Northern Rock issues and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he isn't directly involved in the Blairish backlash - or "partner cash", the investigation into political party funding - voters may assume he is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to make out.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor been directly conned.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not his.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously be facing Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising manager who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is so far not implicated: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, though the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He's been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but he's been slow to make decisions on a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown should do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, as he has not had one for six months, and he should also press for genuine party financing reform.
This will require hard co-operative labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial position with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural for some dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Now that the U.S. housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and delinquency rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days overdue respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 million charge on its American consumer finance business, in part due to weakness in cardholders.
It's too early to panic, though.
Default and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter delinquency rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the US Bankruptcy Code (2005) led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of filings (and thus defaults) would be growing again, or it may be that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports robust payment rates, which show how much of their debt is paid by consumers each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is fairly strong, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit card debts now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at cash flow than assets, so falling prices don't necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They can even work to give the emitters an edge.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay off the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the loan value; and as a result, paying off the card debt falls down the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions of mortgage lenders, by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That should in theory reduce the risk of a quick asset recall.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reevaluate all the loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a sudden infestation of subprime in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of conspiracy to defraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC in the Royal Bank, became a cause célèbre in Britain for the extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its downward spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests at zero, but the three Brits knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the bank interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the 20 million was in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy in the Enron collapse.
The trio of British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery, could not hide its millions in debt or make its failing businesses look successful.
The collapse cost thousands of jobs, over $60 million in market value and over $2 million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and previous chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were both jailed last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million dollars.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that multi-seat model because it's for family private flights or company presidents".
Mr. Firer was Gulfstream's booth manager last Friday at the Millionaire's Fair, a four-day consumer-oriented orgy held at a downtown event center on the outskirts of the nation's capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had set up their display stands, hoping to lure the newly wealthy Russians into all sorts of products, from mahogany-panelled yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer is looking cautiously at a bright orange Porsche in the booth next to his".
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and brass compared to us", he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets".
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas in its heyday.
"We had the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists", says Marshall Goldman, a senior lecturer at Harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
"Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest consumers and spenders".
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-tier rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here", says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attended the fair for the first time along with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"The women are impeccably prepared and the men are very dignified".
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening attire, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Yumatova, who reeled off the designer suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair is aimed at the new rich, the kind of shoppers who would be willing to stay for hours at a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pencils, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
General public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 USD).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a Delft Royal Dutch porcelain booth, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting made from hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling.
In fact, the sellers said that the wealthier Russians with more experience (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people - cash millionaires, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists - fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
At the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil Beds, said he sold two mattress systems for $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that outfits high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for private use, said he had sold three chainsaw-shaped grills for a Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with beams embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels", Mr. Karapetian says.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars".
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash", he said.
"There's more of them than you think".
Those who weren't millionaires could at least pretend to be rich thanks to the support of Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British style) telephone boxes filled with piles of counterfeit $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors would stop to shake piles of money, ask their friends to take pictures with their phones as they rested on piles of money, or pocketed a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", says Karryev.
"Chapsa" surgery could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance coming up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a patrol car of the police appeared.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up", said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant chief of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, who is yet to be identified by police, but who works at the home at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities are still trying to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they're waiting for the tox screen, although the results won't be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has gripped the upper ranks of the Newark police department.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious", Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian".
She was protecting me".
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Liquor Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities", Walsh declared.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
November 21st and found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the home's owner, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh couldn't say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a doctor's office.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rose bush stands in front of the house, and a Dalmatian bark at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanilla ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was found on the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She'd say, 'You've got to keep an eye on this or that,'" she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It is embarrassing".
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to ease credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were increased by the reassuring comments of the US central bank's vice president.
Stock markets eased in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, Ben Bernanke's number two, the chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued stress in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing stock market specimens, Mr Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and throughout October".
If the upward trend persists, the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business would increase, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street amid bad news for the US economy, as home sales hit a record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by an announcement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 percent of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in sub-prime U.S. mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to come to London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6,306.2 at closing, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's top companies.
Germany's DAX index rose 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit stress on markets after strong demand was highlighted in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which priced those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the London stock markets, stressed credit and three-month lending rates "Libor" among British banks, which was the biggest rise since September, at 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara's claims to court
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the team on loan - with that particular title at least - is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, England manager, is starting to fill with offers to become national coach, and if not, a part-time one.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth spot on the batting order will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It's not easy to pull off what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes more from lack of luck than ability.
It's not just in cricket that choice is difficult, for it requires judgements that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two bright young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, were to be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who is to say what a good level is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a wicket and a batsman to get chances to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who is sure to play in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself to "fit and bowls" like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs apiece to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but they've both had their highs and can expect more from these.
The Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can make or break a man's career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, taking 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a double century against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The odds are that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favour Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favour is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early '88 in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds against only 6 for Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his batting some of the momentum he had in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live on swords.
He gets up for nothing on the cricket pitch and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his vehicle at an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking over the distance, to say excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he's including his slip pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which is not to say that Shah doesn't excel, as the tea leaves suggest, it's him who's playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, driving out the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who were hoping the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", says Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it's safe now".
"They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people", he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to a momentary ceasefire.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two sons because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria as the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that a US-allied force had helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues".
"That is why I have come back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since US troops have been entrenching groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they returned because of visa denials and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left it".
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is fear that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and start fighting.
The little Sarre, good manners.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
As in the whole of the country, the people of Saarland lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Saarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic motto of the smallest federal state for its 50th anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which was ranked fifth in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor".
In this way, higher education institutions have traditionally had good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students could finish their university studies here with two or three diplomas.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than average in the upper secondary schools.
"The Saarland is taking advantage of the vocational education system", says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people finish their baccalaureate at the Vocational School, so the Saar is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for vocational education is very wide.
The provision of dual careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Science has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced the high schools to advertise more for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in the general education schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative testing across the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, there is no cost.
Comparison with future studies will show whether the students' performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students with developmental delays decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Saarland did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, the pupils are better at calculating.
To the chagrin of the Saarlanders, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Saarlanders are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez allowed the South American country to change its time by moving the clock back half an hour.
Chavez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As the Official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State reported, according to the new law, the time will be reduced to four hours GMT.
Thus, the South American country will have a time zone that exists in no other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed the obligation on the world by changing a complete hour.
Also, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it", says Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chavez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
In Spain, too, there is a lot of talk about Chávez.
A new call tone is causing a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This was said by the King of Spain, who was annoyed by the continuous interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to one forecast, a decline in real wages is threatening German employees this year despite a strong economic situation.
Experts present a host of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage bill in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault lies in weak wage developments, the rise in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices", Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research in Economic Cycles told the Bild newspaper.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also be borne by the employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" newspaper that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
The employment office should not, of course, be put in an unpleasant position again, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the petroleum derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
Comparing prices with last year, they are up 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere being unsuitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that had not been considered until now. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and eddies in the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that there might be rays on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, the rays are shooting from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud to another, says Cris Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
Venus is not like that: if life ever existed there, it would have to be in one of the earliest stages of evolution", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, life cannot exist on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Venus is possibly an evil twin to Earth, but it's still a twin", Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in mass and size, has evolved so differently.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest results of the research, which will be presented in many articles in Nature, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System, but also the fact that it is the only planet in the solar system that has a planet.
"This also shows that the neighbouring planets have more in common with Earth than we had assumed", reports ESA.
Despite the known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers have also discovered a more rapidly rotating cloud vortex at the South Pole.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high Earth atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost as large with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometres.
This planet, also called the morning star or evening star, orbits the sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar, is not very similar to Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under the same conditions.
On both planets, water had been accumulated that on Earth stayed in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
Whereas on Earth carbon dioxide had turned into carbon rocks, Venus formed most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on an end to the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and that's why he demanded that the grand coalition end this fight over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation", Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"While I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute importance to me", Koehler said.
The EU's position on the Middle East is that the EU is not prepared to accept the Middle East peace process as a political issue.
"The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of the One China policy.
China knows it too", Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was attacked by the Union members because of it.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused major misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
The Chinese government has not only withdrawn the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to sources of information from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
The Chinese Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, demanded that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like the ones in France.
Street battles with police, gunfire, car burnings: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything possible be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from spilling into the streets.
Barricades were erected, vandals fired on the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for the Interior, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party), fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must also ensure that the social problems of our country do not take a violent form".
"We have to take this seriously", he said in the newspaper Neue Presse, published in Hanover.
Not all young people thrive in the constantly changing social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working hard to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits".
It's too early to take the alarm off the hook.
At the same time, Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
Young people have been involved in serious street riots with police in northern Paris over the past few nights.
In Tolouse, too, cars and public buildings were burned.
The President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitation effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the performances are necessary.
Kolat said that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age was above average.
We must ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to the young".
The Turkish Community president added that in Germany, more than in France, "there is a great social control in the families", greater than in France.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But despite everything, we have to be careful".
The Commission's proposal is to 'provide young people with the opportunity of obtaining a job or vocational training more quickly'.
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the previous day a team of almost 1000 police officers is taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interior Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until it is necessary.
On Monday night, about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot began over a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young men was not the fault of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke.
The Federal Chancellor's actions, which are far from reality, show that the coalition has reached its final point in terms of content and that nothing more should be expected of her.
But which country does the Chancellor actually live in?
After her desperate, indifferent and uncontentious performance in the general debate in the House of Commons, it must be said that she does not live in the country that should be ruled by her.
As for the reproach that he was repeatedly engaged in foreign policy activities, the Foreign Minister rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and so he showed he did not want to understand what interests the critics.
The House made it very clear to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There was no interest, no feeling whatsoever, in the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself this way: a very high politics that flees into foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
For example, the prevention of climate change: it praised itself very highly for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be implemented here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
He's always trying to get an impulse into people's heads.
And thus he damages his public image by the pragmatic conception with which he solves problems without going through the motions.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It's amazing how often you get your words wrong when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
He began to stumble "as though he had been in unknown territory" when it came to more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated Republican presidential debate on YouTube and now have only one outsider candidate to fear.
The tensions between the candidates are evident from the outset.
Mitt Romney has blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani responded with a sharp rebuke: "I would like to say that his own house was a 'port' for illegals". Giuliani responded to the former governor of Massachusetts by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group has no clear favorite so far, the eight presidential candidates are taking advantage of the debate on CNN, mainly to discredit their opponents.
The short 30-second videos, shot by Internet users and uploaded to YouTube, don't have much content either.
"In this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power", was John McCain's rebuke to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam veterans when he refuses to recognize "waterboarding", a method of interrogation by allowing a person to drown to simulate his death, as torture.
Reactions from the audience in the St. Petersburg, Florida, hall show that meanwhile the campaign's most important issues are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded loudly when they praised conservative values and denied tax increases.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong then", Romney said, and apologized to the public and the television audience for being pro-choice in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, was not sure what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as the army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as the president.
Thus ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to uphold the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he handed over his command of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is governing the state for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will very soon cancel the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the state of emergency was declared in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurists who have been supportive of Musharraf. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s is still active: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made, which was written in the band's heyday.
Even in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official dinner caused a sensation.
Each one has its box, its wires and, above all, its buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, wearing a white shirt.
On your left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes its own sounds, including rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the Harmonia band was making music again.
The point here is this: the questions accurately showed that the band's name was resonating in people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the '70s?
Especially because the misunderstood Krautrock was always valued more in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music prize "Echo" to the members of the Can 2003 band from Cologne for their life's work, the surprised faces of German pop artists could be seen in the audience.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would spend time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he was an old friend.
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad, they're one and the same.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, that promised much fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a small job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in the First Commune, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
They say that one day a banner of the Ottenstein Harmonia singing association appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages to using the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just about knowing yourself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griessem, and some people remember that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the custom.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother eventually got into esotericism and ensured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, that's Groenemeyer to thank.
His music company, Grienland, set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution of its own to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, the band Neu! was rediscovered.
Harmonia's performance as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the English punk old man and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There's also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences from Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was vacant.
The phrase of Brian Eno accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to it belongs the future".
There are pictures of Harmonia with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the black and white photo projections, where instruments with wires are seen.
In the background are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the drum to produce extraordinary tones with the aid of the effects apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is what it should be.
Three people who go deep into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis is sung "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps her cool.
On stage, you reflect very well on what is already obvious.
Where does the music begin and end?
That can break a man's nerves or give him a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere just needs more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are devoted again to the war in the Balkans.
But neither of them had much conviction.
Either the concepts are too much action and gunfighting or both movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At the beginning there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it was there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument for maybe watching the movie "The Hunting Party" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and crazy nowadays?).
The film has a wonderful visual presentation: at the bottom, his role as a war reporter is the presentation of what Richard Gere could have done, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life were already past, that as a monument to the ruin of his decadence he retained until now most of his charm.
The Hunting Party, despite this triumph, along with Moerderischer Frieden which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian girl from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The film's meaning is lost to the action and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm für Cobra 11" without the highway, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be explored, because there really was never a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two roles), the story about American war reporters who go to track down a Serbian war criminal named "fox", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to do something that the army cannot do and each time it turns out to be a mad trip.
One reason "The Hunting Party" failed is that we are introduced to Simon Hunt at the beginning, who is not allowed to be just a cynical heartless man.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim that they're going to kill later.
So "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what for five years NATO, CIA and all the head hunters of the world could not achieve, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to take revenge in a fair way.
It's so bad, they feel like appealing to the international court in The Hague based on the crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, that one comes to the very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem, it's about an Asian demon mask: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil".
In movies like "The Hunting Party", there are these demons too, but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he wrote that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are failures.
It may also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
There's almost always a rule: when a star goes through a crisis region or through minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It's going to be at least a decade before Hollywood rolls out a good movie about the Holocaust, like Schindler's List.
Classics like the Vietnam War films "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their day.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented live on two television sets at home.
And that's because screenwriters don't have the slightest bit of the skill (that's necessary to be able) in telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out so well in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know how bad the Nazi regime was really.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and aloof look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Diccionario de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change".
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives as a response the negative criticism about the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympic Games.
Many want to continue fighting for the competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that one must be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that the resignation was "not good for the economic situation".
No other project in the big city has stirred up so much enthusiasm in recent times as the idea of hosting the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political, sporting momentum could not be kept at the same level".
Schmidt-Trenz urged the senate not to forget this bill, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statement that Hamburg's ambitions to host the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the bid for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides", von Beust says in WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's bid for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this time period, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance".
Nevertheless, this dream was not over for good, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements made by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to let the opportunity go, if plans are ruined at this moment", said Günter Ploß, the director of HSB, on Wednesday.
The withdrawal of the application is contrary to the statement made by the head of the senate at a reception for the general meeting of the German Public High School Sports Federation (ADH).
There von Beust designated the application of Hamburg for Universities 2015 not as "a substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Just last week the High School Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) criticised the Senate for not taking advantage of the precious time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate was behind with the development of the small neighbourhood of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the building of houses", said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused a great deal of enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Anyone who associates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or did you?
At present, the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like a shadow that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Glitter-Boxes on this list are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm conducted internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six Brillo-Boxes that the museum's former director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet are fakes, and almost a hundred of the other "Stockholm-type" paintings that are in circulation on the international art market are also fakes.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cartons of soap powder "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet museum, hundreds of Brillo-cardboard boxes were on display. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expense), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed a few Brillo-boxes to be produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as original "Stockholm-type" "Brillo-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions, some of them were bought for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hultén made false statements that in the year 1968 in Sweden were produced and exhibited almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the museum's Moderna Museet conservators, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three private Swedish owned that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First their tight plates were printed and smelted and then painted in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed plates.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York does not reach a conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/exhibits".
In July, the authentication committee formally announced that it accepted these "grave accusations" in the case of soap-dust boxes.
But from that moment on there was absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The head of the police, Antonio Trillanes, who has criticized the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not respond to the bloodshed.
Government troops had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers were entrenched for a few hours in the building.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had on Thursday trial for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so he could suddenly deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently, the military police who were supposed to guard him had moved into their ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the downfall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops have blocked off the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president has called an emergency Security Cabinet meeting.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"People are fed up", said Trillanes.
"We call on the people to join our ranks".
General Danilo Lim, who formerly led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that shortly the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The big critics of the government called for a big demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months now, his government has been criticized for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares in the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
You're only holding 20.05% of the stock.
There was a lot of speculation about the takeover of the company.
There are also options for further increasing the financial part in Versatel.
United Internet reported that this step is intended to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday, they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, that means the financial institution holds the equity for a third party partner.
United Internet had already participated the day before with almost 10 per cent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase has placed 17,4 million of the new shares which have a value of EUR 106,4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares from them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products.
"Let's strengthen our collaboration", the United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
United Internet reported on Thursday that initially, the two companies want to be content with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not exercise their right, that is, they make 18.49 percent of Freenet participate.
That meant that both companies kept all the options, especially the participation in the company Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet which will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1,27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch directly held 6,01% of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
