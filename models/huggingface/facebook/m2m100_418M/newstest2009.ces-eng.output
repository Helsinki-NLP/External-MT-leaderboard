The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus at the end of trading
After a sudden fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague stock exchange continued to fall on Monday after it dropped by almost 6 percent.
This time, the Wall Street stock is falling.
The market reaction to the U.S. House of Representatives’ vote, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the financial sector.
Stock fall in Asia
The stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the index eventually deleted some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng stock exchange index in Hong Kong dropped almost four percent during trading, but later a portion of losses was deleted and decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, dropped 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan, according to the index, fell 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the rescue action in the U.S. is uncertain and it will affect the financial markets around the world,” said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependency from the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the U.S. lawmakers should immediately return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it is likely that other countries will feel the impact.
The Bloody Bath of American Stock
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was expected to be spent up to $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 trillion).
The lawmakers ignored the call of President George W. Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a bloodshed and the main stock indices recorded the highest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by seven percent, and the last fall in the same scale was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but once it turned out that the proposal was not passed, the index found itself in a free fall.
U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush's government agreed on a broader form of a financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be held at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in negotiations on approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
But won is not yet.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan for support of the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, Chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
In the Senate, sources say, the plan may be voted earlier on Wednesday.
According to the economists, the announcement of the approval of the rescue plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the revival of the financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a “cutting” due to the complexity of mechanisms to help the markets in practice.
The plan must be effective.
“We made great progress.
We have resolved our differences in view of how the market stabilization package should look,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met with U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy off the non-sales mortgage assets from financial companies, which pull financial companies into severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective on the market as well.
We still need to continue the healing plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets that are drastically decreasing.
The Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, said that the lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors from trading on the Asian financial markets, which are the first in a time zone where Congress’s decision could impact Monday trading.
However, it is still unclear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, or whether they can not link the negotiations at the last minute on a problem.
The lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will make a number of changes.
The total amount intended for the aid of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, following another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
The President may veto this decision, but Congress may veto it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain funds for the recovery of bad mortgage securities, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, remained preserved.
“We worked everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Reduction of gold paddles
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the monetary program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing financing of the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden paddles for corporate directors participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be governed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts for help for the owners of houses who have trouble paying.
The government should negotiate new payments for the mortgages they buy in order to reduce the monthly payments costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Tag: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the chief economist Patria Finance David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“It’s because we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the losses between the financial sector and the government will be divided,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week, Mark says it is not so important.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will consecrate it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that will be approved is the most important at the moment,” Marek stressed.
Combat on the sharp knife: MP3 player against the mobile.
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons for a person to buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the demands of the future owner.
It’s hard to get a high-quality gramofon home to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such music products on LP disks do not come out and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
If, however, the vinyles with art rock, jazz or blues are pressed in your rocks, you’re probably dreaming of such a gramofon.
The same is with music on the roads, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
There are price and quality categories.
For someone it can be unacceptable to spend for a player eight thousand crowns, as well as the fans of Pink Floyd probably hard to try the headset for twenty crowns from the marketplace.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery duration.
Some top music players manage much more than just playing music, but what most mobile phones do not even accidentally.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and essaying, he can play music and video, both record, has a better, a worse camera and can navigate.
And when we take into account smartphones and communicators, you’ll have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little miracle, for no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the earlier the display indicator will send you to the charging machine.
And playing music is one of the greatest grapes of energy.
A few mobile phones can play music for more than ten and twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, therefore, count with the fact that you will not be playing for more than a few hours.
If you’re still calling here and there, get another charger to work for certainty – this also applies to more expensive devices.
The MP3 player will not have this problem, even the worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation for one charging.
Another problem occurs when recording music to the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not each of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile devices without reduction.
For players except for exceptions (iPod) you do not need any special software.
You just need to fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile and player will already create a music library sorted according to the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the user’s reviews.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories similar to the Explorer in Windows and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones know more
When choosing a specific device, you should be interested in the duration of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If music is mainly a curriculum and you’ll listen to it every day just shortly in the tram, you’ll have any mobile phone that will play MP3.
This can be done by almost any mobile phone.
You don’t even need to watch too much what music formats the mobile or player can.
MP3 will manage all and the absolute majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It belongs to the most widespread and, in addition to it, the vast majority of the instruments manage music in the WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service by itself could already be a good argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest as well.
In general, however, it is assumed that this way of selling music (whether through GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people wear the car with them.
Whenever you get the desire to listen to something, the cell phone in your pocket is stuck, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
It still depends on whether you always wear headsets or at least wireless handsfree.
If not, you can take advantage of an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Per the biggest advantage of mobile music will be for many prices.
The cheapest is usually less than three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
Mostly, however, you will be limited by the absence of the output to the usual headsets.
The best and technically the most equipped phones even with a 3.5mm curve for ordinary headsets costs up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the player is, among other things, easy handling.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with the previously common caset or gramofon is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an erroneously enabled mobile internet and subsequently a giant account for data transfer.
Which device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card you will enter up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can manage with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, touch Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don’t have to spend more than 1,100 SEK.
If you belong to more challenging listeners, prefer to touch on specialized mobile - walkmane (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of service is so close to the separate MP3 player.
The latter is in the industry of Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as independently sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand SEK, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery duration (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), you will get MP3 players from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, we miss something here - a virtual operator that would force the classic to slow down.
It may not be missing for a long time.
About the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
He also said that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the EU.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, there may be a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than in the home.
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to go into struggle.
It may sound paradoxically, we have three mobile networks and a penetration high over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to rejoice that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often calls for them, who in the past has repeatedly stated that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It’s probably true that a classic operator with its own network has no chance (otherwise, it’s probably hard to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
The entrance of virtual operators to the mobile market has led to a significant price decrease, which the classic operators have also had to respond to.
However, even before the introduction of stick like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, similar voices sounded in the UK as in us.
But it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
There is no need to go too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, behind Mobilking stands the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns among other things U:fona.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate efficiently, there are fewer customers enough than the traditional operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrow offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and a bet on the untouched target group.
This operator is specifically focused on men.
“Right men choose Mobilking – the operator they like and they can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It’s hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could be captured in us.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický claims: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of the offer of services.”
In the Czech Republic no chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations don’t look too hopeful.
Instead, the launch of Mobilking will happen in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studničková, a spokesman for the Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
She indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything in order that no potential competitors arise.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has long been the GTS Novera group, which would like to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already managed to progress in negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe it is going to blink for better times.
According to the report, the first virtual operator is expected to be launched by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by the untouchable wall of silence.
“At this point, we don’t think that there is a place on the Czech market for the creation of a full-value virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far we have not been addressed by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area,” Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 said in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also referring to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare consensus with the statement of O2: "We have not yet any viable and bilateral profitable business project on which it would be possible to further build."
He added: “In the T-Mobile network, it’s hard to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At the moment we should have a concrete agreement on the table so that it is possible to consider in this short-term."
Vodafone rejects its attention rather to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “Through negotiations with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the field of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we think is the most profitable for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why do we make it easier for such competitors?
The fact that when the operators go something, they will be able to pull for one thread, is also witnessed by the tahanice around the formation of the U:fona.
Per the biggest pressure towards CTÚ went at the time of the U:fone from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from the website.
Now, however, just U:fon is suitable as an argument why the virtual operator is not allowed.
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator on the market.
Given the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would put high demands on him and above all on his services."
Due to this approach of mobile operators, however, the complete disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is directly concerned.
It is not just the position of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - has no authority to interfere with competition.
These are exclusively owned by the Office for Competition Protection (UOHS).
He has a typical attitude to the whole issue.
“Virtual operator’s entry to the mobile market would be possible after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator was concluded for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential stakeholders probably wasn’t interesting enough for the classic operators,” said Kristián Chalupa from the Department of Foreign Relations of the UOHS in response to our question.
The representatives of the operators will probably not be surprised.
From the authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market, it is more than appreciated.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile telephone services."
Apparently, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices do not belong to the interests of the UOHS.
In the truth shocking on the whole case is the impressive conspiracy of the three mobile operators, which arises from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is only a coincidence, is proposed by itself.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations is just a part of a coincidence and a hard competitive struggle.
“The Office has not found signs of an anti-competitive action in this case and therefore has no reason to interfere in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they have no appropriate increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications are the single market from a competitive point of view.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has quite logically - on its network monopoly.
Therefore, in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
Even if we do not admit this argument, it should be at least warning for the UOHS that three mobile operators are doing the same.
At the same time, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the GTS Novera) show that when negotiating with all operators they face very similar obstacles.
Svaling responsibility on the CTU is a relatively usual trick in telecommunications, which the UOHS gives his hands away from the whole matter.
We have met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recent amendment of the telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of the CTU to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to implement, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It happens when no one looks.
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators remains unnoticed, which in Czech mobile networks exists just a few.
These are companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, which are public only partially.
This is usually a multilevel marketing company.
Its own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies usually get only to the selected.
The magic lies in the fact that the company faces the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar re-sales.
“If there were cases you’re talking about, it could be a violation of the terms and conditions we’d deal with and it could result in the termination of cooperation with the company,” said Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activity would not be carried out to responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies can go for thousands of customers.
None of the operators prevent such a procedure.
These companies have unforgettable profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual operators, do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies are used by only a small percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not led to their name, so they cannot have it fully as ordinary customers of mobile operators.”
That should be at least strange.
In addition, another question is opened.
If mobile operators turn their eyes on a similar procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the SCO has a relatively strong authority to reveal similar activities, and if it does not wish, it may not be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea of anything like this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When is not the most expensive
As it has fallen several times in the text, the entrance of virtual operators to the mobile market has brought a remarkable decline in services prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to prevent their formation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, it was just in these moments that regulatory authorities interfered, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and the next operator was built.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case as a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in competencies is more than suitable for them in these cases.
But let’s not throw flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If any of the operators the emergence of some virtual mobile operator has admitted, it will hardly be able to keep the UOHS intact to reject (discrimination) other interested parties.
And we may stop calling drastic than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of the Czech State ceremonially presented new recordings of the national hymn Kde domov můj.
The song was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in coral presentation and instrumental version.
The song was singed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.com server you can listen to all four versions.
Belohlavek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has previously told the Czech radio that he has deliberately chosen for singing solo variants of singers with young representative voices that are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning, I was with both and then also with the church trying to take care that they have a clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they agree,” he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where my home" first sounded in 1834 on the plates of the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Josefa Kajetana Tyla, complemented with the music of Františka Škroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
The first sloca of the song became a natural part of the national hymn after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the establishment of the Independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” hymn?
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time connects to the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, we will enter the history of the Prague Transport Enterprise as the date when the first passengers to enter the metro, tramways and buses will have an electronic voucher in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can buy about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time let it be uploaded to their chip card in the infocentres and workplaces of the Transport Enterprise at the metro stations Museum, Můstek, Holešovice Station, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased via the Internet on the website of the Transport Enterprise www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service until the afternoon.
Those who begin to use the internet store can definitely forget the output window in the metro stations, where they have so far had to regularly stand in long fronts on paper tickets.
The coupon is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard card it is recorded in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers are available with a trained service that will help the interested people with online purchases and also upload the purchased coupon to their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupon on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are installed in several vestibules of the metro.
How do these machines look like?
They are red, they remind tickets markers and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year they should be eighty," he added.
Coupons check the driver's place automatically
The service of the automates that will start working tomorrow is simple.
You just need to insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded on it.
Electronic kupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Therefore, in the city trains and bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, which drive to the capital mainly the inhabitants of the Central Czech municipalities.
"In the trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, using which they determine the timely and band validity of the coupon," explained Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which sets the schedules of Prague public transport.
The city buses have card readers built in the driver's box.
Therefore, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the specified place on the side of the cash.
Thus, the driver will check the validity of the uploaded coupon.
“If the passengers need to verify the validity of the uploaded coupon, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal added.
Passengers who do not drive by suburban buses and will not remember when the voucher expires, can go back to the self-service machines where the voucher on the card is recorded.
Here, the information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
Sudets call for a referendum in the United States
The Sudanese Germans in 1945 demanded the integration of Schumava to the United States.
It flows from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Czech Scientific Library.
When we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945 a group of Sudet Germans appeared to be the President of the United States.
This follows, among other things, from a letter, which was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Czech Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the U.S. President not to allow the return of the "Shumavskaya župy" - captured by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We’ve understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure by saying that the U.S. troops come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter, signed with the words “People to whom Shumava’s fate lies in their hearts.”
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia gives supposedly the Sudet Germans - by knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, negligence, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the U.S. President ask for the Schumava to take over the protectorate for present and eternal times.
“We can’t believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and rejects the minorities, and with nothing, nothing, nothing, contribute to the victory of the Allies,” the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the revenge of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubts about the thoughts of the Schumacher Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Schumacher County on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some monuments, it adequately depicts the expectations of the Sudet Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had at least to guess that it would be about their withdrawal from the Republic, only few of them accepted that possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy to the Sudets.
Some believed they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Budějovice.
He was during the war as a Budějovic German deployed to the Navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that when they returned home, the Czech will be suitable for them,” Chalupa said.
No one of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted with the fact that he would be withdrawn from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don’t think – you’ll pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
This is the most expensive road safety campaign in Czech history.
It will be a mass media campaign that will be launched by the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Aleše Rebíčka, has promised that it will prevent the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on the folders.
It should prevent drivers from driving fast and drinking alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them that before they leave, they should be attached.
He wants to touch conscience primarily to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least also to professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
This is the “blood” slogan of the campaign:
You don’t think – you’ll pay!
The word “you don’t think” is written with big letters on the spectator.
And in the blood crawl there is the word “pay”.
This has to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of negligence with his own life.
The viewers will be scared by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
It was launched by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar and Driving for Drivers
The driver has a system of sugar and bits.
The sugar for them is that if, for example, they go to the red, they will save time.
A bitch is a threat of fines or accidents.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk,” says the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Hospital Martin Kořán.
And therefore, information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are needed, says the psychologist.
It is less efficient, according to him, tables that warn drivers of hazards.
"If a static table is installed warning of danger, it is likely to soon coincide with the surrounding area and drivers will not take care of it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert voted for the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Pre-Jordan, Eastern Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did this in an interview published on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
“We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the territory of Israel), because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He said that the return would include Eastern Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want the tractors or bulldozer to cross his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places" that are located inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Exit from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Highlands, which he said is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But it would also require some efforts from Damascus.
“I don’t propose a peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shiite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support provided by terrorism (the Shiite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law is unknown, walking in a remote bus is not allowed.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padova, the question arose whether stevardi and passengers can move on the bus while driving.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, steward’s activity is contrary to the road traffic law,” Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident, which last week killed a twenty-two-year-old steward, was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver at the least secure place in the car, though she had two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can collapse or brake sharply, even when Stevard raises the coffee or the newspaper.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with places to stand according to the technical certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The distance buses of the Student Agency do not have places to stand; this is confirmed by the company’s director Radim Jančura.
"We did this with the ministry and in the beginning the movement of passengers was not allowed.
Then they revoked it and we came to the fact that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The Law of Stewart is not known.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of Steward - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carriers to provide services.
The road traffic law only knows the term of the guide of the vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined,” said Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, says that the issue of the law is treated sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has permitted stations in the homologation.
This ends,” he says.
The buses are divided into urban, where there are stations and limited maximum speed, intercity with stations with higher permissible speed and remote without stations with highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety bands.
As in the aircraft, the expert says
BESIP Expert on Traffic Safety Jaroslav Hořín in the movement of stevards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
“With a smooth driving, many dangers are not at risk, the situation can be compared to the service in aircraft.
It’s not sure when the turbulence will come and the aircraft can be hit in the head.”
“But if the bus stops sharply, naturally the laws of physics apply.
Just like the city bus or tram.
The safety of the stevards must be addressed by the carriers by internal regulations," he says and also says, from the point of view of the law, the problem is unresolved.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
The Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred.
Even after an accident, the manager does not consider their profession to be risky.
“When I get the impression that the profession of the steward is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers at arrival.
This will save costs,” he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the Director of Asia Alexey Litvin, who operates a fraction of lines compared to SA.
“We don’t have a steward, we’re against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with some deadly accident," he said less than a year ago.
It was a huge tragedy.
In a line connection crash to Naples, a young steward from Plzeňsk, who worked for the company for two years, died.
The Slovene truck was likely out of the line without using the router and blocked the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but put him in the right front.
That it would be sold out two seats reserved for the rest of the steward, Janchura refuses.
“These places are not reserved for remote connections, they are blocked.”
The company plans to appeal the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the ortel court, but the financial compensation is also expected by the guilty.
Amendment to the law?
Untold
The clarification of the steward movement on board the bus could bring to a law amendment, on which over a year works a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
“There was no concrete conclusion.
The buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile while driving,” says the expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the steward as something that would significantly threaten the safety of passengers,” concludes spokesman Hanzelka with the fact that the safety control of buses is in the authority of the police and the work safety authorities.
Dusseldorf is Frankfurt
The great words in the letter of the Board of Directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
By joining the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, a "central institution of the financial group will be established for capital markets trading," we read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will introduce a "set of competences" to the transaction to ensure long-term revenue.
And at all, such connections can be a decisive impulse to further associations in the country’s banking sector.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervision Authority, whose communication to the country government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it is, is, however, spoken for a long time – even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of the Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, during the presentation of the six-year management outcomes at the end of August, heard that the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße bank house with one of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, has no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka-Bank, behind which one half of the country’s bank and the other union of the savings, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be trading on the capital market or a part of it.
The negotiations have just begun, the financiers say.
About Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees belongs to the most important employers on the Frankfurt financial market, the consolidation in the savings sector is not spoken for the first time.
In 2003, it seemed that Deka-Bank could be fused with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
At the end there was nothing from this triangle.
Shortly after the fusion plans came to the public, the Hesse country government spoke against the participation of the Helaba bank.
The other two banks were not connected.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz took over the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, speculations have repeatedly appeared about the connection of Deka-Bank with land banks.
Recently, however, the speculation about the connection of his financial house with others has been negative by Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Bank.
However, it seems that it is independent of the belief that the convergence of the various bank houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now after the national parliament elections in Bavaria, the first one could be to draw up the association of the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not a good news for Helab.
If the pressure to further fusion should increase, there are gradually possible partners for such connections.
In the south it would only play the second housle even though the financial crisis so far faces significantly better than the bank houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Connections to WestLB were banned by the Union of Savings and Jewelry Banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 85% share in Helaba.
This is the case with the Nord LB.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of the individual institutions match together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of land banks, the German Savings Union and Jir banks have not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the dissolution of the WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the board of directors there is also stated that it is seeking a "complex solution" for the entire bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the linking of the individual folder with Deka-Bank, the time will show.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as "weekend with Italy"
This is the first time for Elena, the third or the fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so it will be all different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre Kaiser shell, a stronger brush stands, and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest prove how deep tones his throat can get out.
Elena Lucu first blows and then kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking near the Puorta Nuova station, four buses with the label "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" will depart this evening at 23.45 a.m., expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are occupied primarily by the Italians, and only by the Brazilians in one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South American people are already singing with their flag, they are already celebrating the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it’s nothing for Italy.
Marc, who is wearing a long jacket with a coat and glasses with wide silver curtains, the three buses belong.
He has been on the Oktoberfest for five years, and only this year he has organized three excursions.
In the night there, over the day between stalls with beer, at 22.30 leave back.
Sleeping would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome drink of Kaiser beer, cooked precisely according to the Bavarian beer purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
The buses depart in the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
Beer is not available, not yet.
The bus runs fast, and the passengers sleep.
They do well, they will still need their strength.
It is built in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where on the highway number 8 a little ahead of Munich, there is another break and a lot of other buses with the Italian recognition mark.
When Marc’s group finally arrives at mid-seventh in the morning near Theresienwiese, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and others gather, Marco has the last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First, put a yellow hat.
On it is written "Oktoberfest" on the left of the swabach, next to Marc's travel agency's internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the door to the beer tent is open, run away!" calls Marco in the morning air.
“Go!” go and put places in the back of the tent.
"Not forward so that you don't interfere, and not all the yellow caps on the same leaves, put yourself around the space!"
The price is 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don’t forget the scratch.
“Tell the security officers that we behave well.
Once you leave your places, they’re gone!”
Thirdly, “Today at mid 11 am, be here again!”
And up to Wiesn, room with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as a mark on trees, ceds, and even on the electoral poster of one major Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for withdrawal.
It is known as the “weekend with Italy” as the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
There are no accurate data about the number of visitors available; it is said that fifty thousand of those who go on a trip through the Alps and fall into the beer stores, ten percent of all visitors said this weekend arrived from Italy.
A series of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from the southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which holds national statistics in which Italians before the British (approximately 60 interventions) and the Austrians (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Particularly popular among the Italians is Hofbräu.
Unhealthy Nights for Hypo Real Estate Loaners
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
Well that this policy used the word "relatively" and inserted the fact that the German banking sector will not be saved from the crisis development.
That happened last weekend.
The Dax Index monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives from the consortium of German banks a loan of several billion dollars to protect against turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the aforementioned credit aid will be up to €35 billion.
The interest will be required by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) to pay only from the actually exhausted amount.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he borrowed money, this state-of-the-art financer refinanced extremely short-term, which is now unlikely because of unreliance in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve dropped by 95% to €2.37 million and its share of own capital was slightly reduced from 1.6% to 1.45%.
The normal income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, the income from increased debt value and from certain securities as well as from the abolition of credit trading reserves fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only due to higher revenues from the reimbursement for the subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulation and by the mediation of the trade for group enterprises, the sixteen percent decline on the profit side was still moderate.
The former state financer, after his privatization in 1990, burned on mortgages for businessmen, which were then allocated from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little earning in the traditional state financing, Depfa was then more engaged in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and public investors (PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write out something, and these deposits will have a "principal material effect" on the calculation of the profits and losses of the whole group, as some have left uncertainly heard.
There is no division.
It was reduced by two-thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major funder of state and infrastructure projects since Depfa's acquisition.
More strongly than other institutions, it depends on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago practically dropped the source of interbank loans because the banks keep liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – approximately €50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group with this loan are covered for a near time and the company is protected "from the influence of international monetary markets currently to a large extent unable to function."
Other sources have heard that these funds will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Board Chairman Georg Funke, on the contrary, said that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to take advantage of the monetary markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the Hypo Real Estate Group’s competitiveness on the market is now guaranteed.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors expect.
But with regard to the dynamics and insufficiency of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan would not have to be fully exhausted.
The opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank on Sunday late afternoon seemed to stand before insolvency, the rescue could not, though preliminary, calm the passion.
The stock price dropped by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond rates were wellined.
While priority debts have virtually not moved, the secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This applies primarily to the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically to the bonds with a period of expiry after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally seemed to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their deadline.
But there can also be something that almost no one can hope for now – the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, with the reports coming simultaneously with this partial nationalization, the probability now has become just a legitimate hope.
This long-term lenders will probably prepare a number of overwhelming nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the borderline at least to create a transfer of losses from previous financial periods to currency revenues from subsequent years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself on the first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to say: that German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows this word already from mang. In her new blog about exchange residence she tells about Japan.
First day in Japan.
I was nervous.
On my way to school, I was overwhelmed.
I live in the shore of Tokyo in direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the center in Tachibana.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eighth and twenty minutes before eighth begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But even before the lesson began, I had to introduce myself.
I am not the type of man who likes to speak before people, not before the class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I wore my host mother’s old dress, bluse, blue underwear and black leather shoes.
I stood up in this way and tried to say everything right: ‘Sajonara Wo še Sylvana...’, my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week I have my birthday.
I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All the 31 girls in the class choked, choked and mowed, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I knew it from my mango.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considered it a honor that a foreign student had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally swallowed.
They spoke one through the other and chichotaly and asked me about the possible and the impossible — and it is seriously difficult to understand the Japanese English.
After a break, they all packed their bents.
My host mom also made me such a box for lunch - and that's something different than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small pairs, salad of garlic and rice, fruit and a kind of fish in a tofu pasta.
I don’t know exactly what I’m doing in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
It is sure that everything is really good.
Well, maybe unless on the slane loaded slane, br!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives the boy a handmade bento, which is artistically adjusted in this case, and hopes that the boy will know closer during the dining at a break.
I read this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I will see it here too.
'Why just Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“For it just fascinates me.”
I have been reading manga for many years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started to learn a little Japanese.
I was clear that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness to tradition, habits and habits.
They are highly appreciated here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
The rats have feelings.
When a puppy or puppy escapes from a danger, does this mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify if they feel the same when they behave the same as us?
The internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else to be able to prove it until now, when we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to dedicate ourselves to another kind and open questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter the uncomfortable field because the hardware does not match.
When the rats get in danger, they will do the same as many other animals: they will pretend to be dead, escape or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists judge comparable subjective experiences.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the animal experience.
This is because the circles associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (for its part in short-term memory and execution or control functions).
This extensive area is significantly more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems that it is completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is a reason to assume that a person is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide a person’s linguistic essence: because so much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if the consciousness of the tongue did not matter, the tongue would surely affect it, so the animal consciousness, whatever it is constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out how the consciousness may look at other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, due to a special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its exploration puts us in front of great problems.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides that there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easily accessible.
It would be possible to explore the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, to which Christof Koch and Francis Crick dedicated themselves, focuses more on the neural corelates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but may also not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does that result in the feelings?
I draw them out of the fact that the emotional system, such as the system of fear, is activated in the brain aware of its own activities.
What we call "fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) takes advantage of the operational memory.
Seeed from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex that are characterized by the primates, and especially people.
In connection with the linguistic nature, a subtle distribution of perception occurs, because using words and grammatics, we can distinguish and categorize states, to assign them to others alongside ourselves.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain tribe devoted to physical feelings, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the brain tribe.
Because this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could peacefully participate in the feelings perceived by several animals.
Clearly theoretically, I cannot object to this, but I consider it unproofable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to be fear for rats and humans is likely to feel both organisms the same: but how can it be verified, says Pankseep, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave the same way?
The sword escapes from the danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the simplicity of behavior cannot prove the simplicity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, on the contrary, the brain does not swab.
But is the brain strain responsible for the feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it in man: how would we want to prove it in a mouse?
I think rats and other mammals, even swabs (who knows?), have feelings.
I really don’t know how I should prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of ours (because human consciousness lies on special circles and on the tongue), I’d rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can wait for progress at the neural level, if we measure the same for rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not explore language and consciousness, I do not explore feelings, for I do not know if they exist.
It can be considered short-looking, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I am a practical emotionist.
UEFA President Platini: a deadline of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations will soon be directed by the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the ME together with Poland,” Vasjunyk said.
This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the early completion of the timetable of construction or rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts go on.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We need to work as quickly as possible now,” Ukrainian President Grigorij Surkis said.
“UEFA will continue to follow us.”
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The Polish PZPN leadership was revoked by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlock.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzewiecký.
“There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish press agency PAP.
“We’ve sent a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini that this step will not end up preparing for the 2012 ME.”
Several teams from the first league were only in the last season due to manipulations sentenced to a forced drop, eventually even the start of the league had to be quickly moved.
Dennis Quaid Returns
She wanted to make an advertisement to the new film, she spoke in an interview on private affairs - and now she has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage disruptor.
He is angry and returns a blow.
The late war of roses with the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce together, these two Hollywood actors lead an unpleasant dispute - in the eyes of the public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for her marriage’s collapse: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
The scam was only known after the divorce.
The incentive for this mental striptiz was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - that tells the story of a distorted marriage.
Denis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was clear: “He’s crazy,” the 45-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that “Meg repeatedly overwhelms the history of our relationship and adjusts it.”
Furthermore, it is “politimate” that the joint sixteen-year-old son, Jack, is again “openly reminded of the pain and radical changes that make a divorce for every child.”
While Ryan has lived alone since divorce, Quaid is married again and has recently become the father of twins.
He concludes his considerations of disappearance as follows: “My life goes on anyway.
I think I’m happy to have a wonderful family that works great.”
Tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even 50 percent cheaper, according to one current study.
Flights and accommodation in hotels again slowed down - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on the bookings made from the first half of 2008 and, after the price rise in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of prices on the hotel market have risen, accommodation in many places has already slowed down.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 followed European cities increased an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The lowest trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
As the cause of this trend, American Express considers the weak dollar rate, which has caused "the cracking appetite of American tourists to travel."
The hotel prices have also been more affected by financial centers than industrial centers, such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices with a 26.3 percent rise even recorded a European record.
The price of tickets also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
As a result of the increased price of kerosine, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, the fuel-duty long-distance flights had even increased by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the price of the Economy-class flight tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class, knowledge changes were less significant.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March they grew by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
In the German national years, according to the quoted study, prices fell even half.
One of the reasons for this price decline is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The meaning of the tension is the disruption of non-profit lines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to build a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to increase Failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach took part in the game until late and failed with a balloon on the stick.
His report was accurately formulated and came out of his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” Hermann Rieger sailed in the corridor to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Much of this did not happen in the catacombs, the half-time break ended and most people were sitting on their places.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades and enjoys greater respect than many instant actors.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol pulled and lifted his finger on a sign of consensus.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jola.
His command was probably the same: here with the second goal!
The implementation did not happen.
“It didn’t look good at everything here today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it to be “more relaxed.”
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers are grateful to the head of Mladen Petriće (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbishans could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
The audience so on Saturday afternoon celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live-updated table on the video wall, in which their team was presented as a premier.
It will be a birthday without a party.
“We know how to evaluate it,” said Marcell Jansen.
He thinks that the continuous table result symbolizes the uncalculability of the league rather than the domination of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silva, the goalkeeper Petriće and the FC Bayern gained Jansen - is slowly in place, but it is still unable to blink.
“We need more sensation and more dribling,” Jol strongly said.
After the vote defeat
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the flooding of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall up to 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow got something again.
Around 20:30 this most important world stock barometer showed a five percent decline to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange was with more than seven percent in minus at 1548 points.
The worst on that was in Dow at this time American Express, which lost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs shares have lost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, Warren Buffett had a share in this company.
The rescue plan is to provide funds for the purchase of so-called corrupted mortgage papers.
However, the whole amount is not paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state should receive the optional shares of financial companies, which could be repaid if the rate develops favorably, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe drop sharply
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. investors do not get rid of doubt.
The stock rate of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly down and leaves the Dax index.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned financial market rescue by the state.

Dax clearly slept below the psychologically important 6000 points limit and with a minus of 3.7 percent recorded 5,839 points.
The world’s stock markets are on their knees.
In New York, the business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors are concerned that the US government’s $700 billion rescue package should not be sufficient to revive the events on the financial markets.
During the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent, and is so at 10 809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate can vote on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges went only in one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, and in Paris, the CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent.

Dark Matter Affects Space Sond Flight
For years, scientists have not been aware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of the spacecraft during the so-called swing-by (gravitational prack).
Experts are concerned that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity should not be completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft was flying through space.
The fault of the fuel lines, which are soon frozen, now threatens to die in the winter.
Among the scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon causes confusion – anomalies of the gravitational stream.
The gravitational prack is the air maneuver of the spacecraft, in which they gain additional movement in the gravitational field of some spacecraft, such as Earth.
Through this, the sond can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what the scientists have stated for years in this case in surprising: flying bodies do not behave a hundred percent as a man would expect according to the old good law of gravity.
There are irregularities in speed.
The sonds unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of the gravitational plaque.
Some experts are concerned that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curving space, might not be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein did not mistake, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational plate using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in space has been discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has been known by space scientists for about 10 years.
It is evidently a gravitational force, whose effect on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the contrary, is completely invisible, which means it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, even visible light.
According to scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are released
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Italian Foreign Minister said the kidnapped tourists in Egypt are freed again.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shooting before the release, six kidnappers werely killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already ongoing.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists travelling to the Sahara are free.
This was by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to the reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24 release confirmed: "Our co-citizens and other hostages were released.
We’re just checking their health,” Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are in good and safe.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are already on the way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the background of the shooting before the release of the hostages: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom,” said the citated worker.
“It was just about taking the hostages,” he said, “when suddenly this surprise came.”
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and two of them were captured.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of €6 million from Germany; the money was to be transferred to the German wife of one of the kidnappers.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with reference to one of the German mediators said the release of the hostages is extending because the kidnappers are afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female-gender hostages after paying the ransom.
Men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe way of escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
Father’s abuse “leads to suicide”
Several years of abuse by the father led a woman to kill herself, the court said.
After acknowledging eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-year-old Michael Trerise from Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years in prison.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly binding his granddaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
“I feel responsible for her death,” Trerise wrote in a statement.
The court also said Mrs. Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise binding her and binding her eyes and then sexually abusing her while her mother worked in the bar.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His granddaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court said Mrs. Randle, who spent a significant part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by a ghost of abuse that was committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in the court that in 2006 friends of Mrs. Randle, who was also very dedicated to surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that "he gave up life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
He is believed to have drowned himself with an igelit bag.
Randle stood face-to-face to his daughter's grandfather, who wrote the testimony, which ended with the words: "I bonded her and bonded her eyes.
“I did not abuse it.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, “You’re an extremely strange fetishist and it had to be terrible for your victim when she was just seven years old.
“This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even worse is the fact that if she did not do so, the case would probably not come to the court at all.”
“I would especially like to emphasize the consequences that, according to the Stephani parents, your crime on their daughter had in those years,” he added.
"Obviously otherwise she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The person who has lost the data will be charged.
The BBC learned that a government official who left strictly secret documents in the train in June will be accused according to the State Secret Act.
The man left two strictly secret documents in the train on Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents were handed into the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the least serious offence against the aforementioned law and nothing indicates a criminal intention.
BBC Defence Reporter Frank Gardner said that such a move will be surprising for many in Whitehall.
“They probably thought that the matter is being resolved internally between the Ministry and the Office of the Government,” he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged in accordance with Section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is the clause that concerns the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to accuse the officer on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
B&B debt debt debt debt
The British co-operative deposits may have to deal with the debt of more than £80 million after the Bradford & Bingley bank's rescue.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect deposits to 2.6 million customers in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be paid to all companies taking customer deposits, including 59 co-operative deposits.
Director-General of the Association of Cooperative Deposits (BSA) Adrian Coles said it’s “thinking” that the Deposits and their members have to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repayed by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest, which will be held, will pay every year to all 700 financial companies taking customer deposits.
The Compensation Plan of Money Services for the BBC confirmed that all 59 co-operative deposits are included in this number.
It is humiliating that these institutions that behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from so prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the deposits from it should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the debt interest will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that backups will have to find £81 million to pay the interests from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Chief Executive Officer of the Trade Association of Cooperative Deposits, told the BBC that he is convinced that it is not fair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the growth of the housing market now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from so prudent.”
According to BSA, no backdrop has fallen since 1945 when it appeared.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the possibilities to protect the co-operative backups and their members from an account that could be significant," Cole added.
The interest paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest will be paid for a whole year and it could be almost twice as much.
Since co-operative deposits are shareholders-free organizations, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk increases by 5 pounds per liter.
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Milk Factory has announced that it will raise its milk wholesale price by five pounds per liter from Monday.
This is the second increase in prices this year, after a double-pension fall in February, and comes after a research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers have to decide themselves whether they want to reflect the price in customer prices.
Before the February rise, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Previous articleBangladesh’s ex-prime minister has been rejected
Bangladesh's court rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vadžid's request for release on guarantee, which means that if he returns to his homeland, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused her to be released for a guarantee in connection with the allegation that she received more than fifty million taxes (729 700 dollars) from a certain entrepreneur when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of the few accusations of corruption that are raised against it.
Chalida Zijá, a long-standing political rival of Shaykh Hasina, was released earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League (Awami League), has called for the government held by the local army to first give her full freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was freed in honor to be subjected to a medical procedure abroad, it is unclear under the conditions of her release whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court has rejected Shaykh Hasina’s request for a guarantee with the fact that he does not need a guarantee when he is already abroad undergoing an investigation released for an honorary statement,” said her advocate Rafique-ul Huq.
We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.”
Her lawyers claimed she needed a guarantee to return from abroad to the country for preparation for December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasina should return home after October 17.
She was arrested last year after the armed provisional government took power, but was released from prison in June to be able to go abroad for medical treatment.
Shaykh Hasina and Chalida Zijá both reject all accusations against each other.
Fear of vaccination against armor in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, 200,000 children did not participate in the recent large-scale vaccination against arms due to violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations vaccinated six provinces last week.
However, he says he was unable to get to children in the south in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
The UN spokesman said this happened despite the Taliban’s promise that it will not attack or defend thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB loses court dispute on ITV
BSkyB lost a court dispute on the review of the Competition Commission decision that ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting company ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% below 7.5%.
The Commission has previously stated that BSkyB’s share blurred the competitive struggle and gave companies an unproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB share was purchased in 2006 in the store, which as a result prevented the company NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, ITV from buying.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a share in the ITV by BSkyB caused doubts about the independence of the ITV, and called on the Competition Commission to begin an investigation.
Virgin Consortium Chairman Sir Richard Branson, Consumer Organization and Regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued by the fact that the forced reduction of her share in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution disproportionate – especially because BSkyB previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation of American Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The Tah came in a situation where the report on the case prepared by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized the White House officials, the legislator and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was triggered by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interrogated during the investigation were lying to the investigators in order to blame justice.
In the report, General Inspector Glenn Fine said: “These serious accusations, including potential criminal offences, have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to declare was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice dismissed nine U.S. lawyers in December 2006.
The ministry said the lawyers were released because of their poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the release of lawyers was not evaluated worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to the conclusion that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican parliamentarians and senators, while others refused to investigate the allegations of voter fraud against the Democrats.
American lawyers are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but cannot be removed for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was shot down and eventually resigned.
A number of members of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report of the general inspector was very critical about Gonzalez's role in the case, saying he was "main responsibility" for the dismissal, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position, and that he "not engaged notably" in the event.
Other officials, including former Bush senior adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not working together in the investigation.
The Meat Loaf Command will be awarded
The rock star Meat Loaf receives one of the Q Awards for her epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will come to a ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" by the awarded recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The nomination for this year is led by the Coldplay group, which has come into a closer selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of the Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the top 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been in the ranking for about nine years and has sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered in recent years from health problems, in 2003 he was also operated due to irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his headphones.
Curious streets, often forgotten and soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other land communications, some famous, others just useful.
But even many taxi drivers-veterans and long-term locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village district and leads to the north from First Street - without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dust pass than a traffic move.
There are no pages with the names of the streets.
In the normal atlas, it is practically invisible.
However, the street has a fan.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants Extra Place to regain and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-standing neighbors who say they were shortened by the street charmed simply because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was zušlechted.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of the Construction, which has the street in its power, has no least interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the land committee of the municipality, representatives of the city office and the company Avalon Bay designed a plan according to which the street developer should buy.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the General Community 3, the committee prefers such a option when the street will remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
“The city already owns very little land, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in its ownership,” she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to re-plate a small street and settle places to sit, some of which would use a cafe, whose interest in renting space developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this falling street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Preservation, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office is to develop property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more colourful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a flat trace in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when the great farm of Philip Minthorn was divided among several of his children and on that narrow strip of the country no one claimed.
The extra place was led by the back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, and the street is the most famous as the background photo on the album package of the Ramones group "Rocket to Russia".
“This place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
“It was full of rubbish, broken clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and wings.”
Some local citizens, including bloggers who write about the cultivation of the East Village neighborhood, stand against the idea of selling the Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, though scratched, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarity – a almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (with the subtitles "The Book of Claims: a gorgeous nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), hanged part of the story of Extra Place from the rubric Talk About the City, which appeared in the New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark even in the day and bound by cutting iron doors of warehouses and closed windows, where a week old newspaper goes through in the roofs."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one last night looked exactly the same.
The puppy passed through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, on the place of which today stands a shop of expensive clothing.
On the walls was a graffiti and next to the fresh dosage of the thrown newspapers was a empty bottle of beer.
A couple of passengers said that they rarely think of Extra Place, but they suggested that some rebellion could fit him.
On the contrary, Fields said they think some people underestimate the impressivity of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “was in places of dark, wet and disgusting.”
Debate on bilinguality: immersion in English
In this edition of Education Focus, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates’ attitude towards bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and educational director at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "More than you think: Why the middle class needs to choose schools."
To respond to Spanish voters is a big issue.
Barack Obama’s educational agenda only proves this.
Obama’s campaign points out that “afro-American and Spanish students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama’s educational agenda fosters, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
However, the question of Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take for example Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the East Los Angeles district.
The students of this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Spanish from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom arrived recently, are just learning English.
However, in 2008 the state mathematics tests reached the highest level of incredible hundred percent of fourth-class students.
Nearly the same amazing nine-three percent of fourth-class students got to the highest level in the state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, constant evaluation of abilities and an approach without excuses.
Moreover, and that Obama should notice, according to Lindy Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the educational approach of the school for those who are just learning English is a “full immersion.”
The immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the class and don't know who it is."
“It works,” she said, “for us it works.”
Would Obama take the school as the Sixth Street Prep as a model, how should other schools look like with a large share of Spanish and English-speaking students?
The results that the school is achieving should make the answer to this question obvious, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education undermines the prediction of Obama’s response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, the matter has recently trivialized when he stated that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to delete performance differences, he should rather think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than laugh at them and trivialize them.
Oil declines sharply due to economic concerns
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. plan to save the financial markets will not have to revive the economy.
The prices of terminated oil traders fell in the morning trade at the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
The price has dropped more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, the commodity markets have been shocked by financial disruptions on Wall Street and also by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, which again jumped on the wave of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety again scattered investors on Monday, even after Congress's presidency announced that it reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report was shadowed by recent concerns that the financial crisis is far from the end.
In the latest episode of the progressive breakdown, the government announced that the Citigroup group will buy a banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially stated the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital’s analysts said the angry weekend talks that led to a plan to save the economy “prove as unable to revive the mood on the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decrease.
“The prospects for markets with global shares, interest rates, and currency rates have been strongly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the infection.
From the commodity perspective, our greatest concern is how far the American virus will spread to the whole world and especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts limited their expectations for the next year as oil consumption decreased due to the slowing growth of the economy, and lowered their 2009 petrol prices forecasts by about 20%.
Wild racing in the second quarter surpassed team record
After spending the last eight seasons in Jets more than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had already seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets transformed the pointless game into a spanile drive.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizon Cardinals, with their striking game, matched the dark clouds over each other.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles to a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly pre-marking the afternoon in which their progressive cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter for another two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and another 10 seconds before the half of the match.
"It wasn't anything extraordinary," Favre told Coles about all his recordings.
“He’s a good player.
We communicated great, whatever people think.”
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense was attacked by the quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis captured the missing shot and returned it for 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another record and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumb.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was the best at all.
The Cardinals team got the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely hit a twenty-yard goal from the field, thus gaining the lead 34-0.
This is the most Jets ever won in one quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe this madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points without answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I much more than the third.
There were many points in a short period of time.”
The relaxed Gebreselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best distance runner at all, when on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon he broke his own world record and became the first man to run a 26.2 miles-long race under two hours and four minutes.
By victory on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 he overwhelmed 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35 years old, has set a 26th world record in his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has overcome a world record or is at least a world champion on all distances from a metric mile to a marathon.
Last month Gebreselassie missed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing because he was afraid - from the backward point of view too scared - that polluted air would irritate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised he would run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the goal - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a flash-speed diameter of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a longer track, the marathon record in the last decade dropped by more than two minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had two weeks ago cramps in the liver and missed a week of training.
It was clear that the break caused him rather than delayed.
“I’m so happy,” Gebreselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little doubtful today, but everything was okay.”
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia - because he said he planned overly his races, generally avoided the world marathon tops, relied on guides, as if it were a race on the track, and built world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running quality.
Maintained in the pace of four Keenan reached Gebreselassie half at 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped, the Gebreselassie was constantly pursued by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie, he last took and fled to Kwambai, who then reached the second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by five minutes.
Kamathi ended third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, she finished the excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitěnková, a cousin from Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
Record time 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff from the UK.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitěnková surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever run, she improved her personal maximum by five minutes.
She ran the race intelligently and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenya runners flee to a great advance and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya was third at 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles to the life of the black people in a separate city
Hidden among the glowing entertainment parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from all the glowing, noise and enormous, there is a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life is revived.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as easy as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet fields, three hundred brown leather, three hundred good swimmers, enough quayava, two schools and no prison."
Now it is a hunting place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee arrived at the Eatonville’s annual Zora! festival to make a tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a side, even though it has made it a stop for tourists by incorporating it into the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It’s still as independent, decent and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what’s about.”
Even today, in the year in which the black president candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of races, many of the people here remain cautious about the views of foreigners.
“We’re very careful about how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
“It must be right.”
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both the historic model of the Black Rise and a community of 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shaded example of the southern rural black culture – sometimes neglected, sometimes praised – which emerged from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She presented to the world her hometown through heart-filled books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide have transformed the city a bit into the 17th road, which leads through the often overlooked centre of Florida, in the stage of black history and human drama.
With the rise of a big bubble in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the shop of the first eatonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "there is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds, which is always cared for by Howard Miller, although he doesn't know how much to read or write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and anything that fits the hour hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston's Eatonville connected with the government, but also with negration, marriage and sex.
This was obviously not a typical Fodor's publishing company.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's Girls' Corses, which Hurston made immortals by quoting men who sang foolish songs about their beauty.
“Some people didn’t like it,” she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chip center, which often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seven-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time she arrived in the city, she arrived without notice in the enormous Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is still today proud of decent clothes.
The majority of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but a lot of people were shaken.
“The people of Zora have always loved to see,” Franklin said.
But, he added, hanging on a chair on the back terrace with a view of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville, together with the rest of the world, forgot her.
Although she was once a literary star, the contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black girl at Barnard College in the twentieth century, she was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she previously lived.
In Eatonville there were no greater sadness ceremonies or large public reading.
“I think they didn’t understand either its significance for the world or its reference at all,” said Valerie Boyd, the author of Hurston’s “Wrapped in Rainbows” in 2003.
The change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
The representatives of Orange County wanted to stretch the city by a five-string highway instead of the Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-string main road.
The breakdown of Orlando has already pushed the interstate highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came in a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a complex historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for the mixing of races of hatred brought to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a group of white boys, they came and throwed orange and things on people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“There was a woman who was killed.
They thrown melon out of the car.
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the demand of the Supreme Court for forced integration and declared his decision in the Brown case against the Chamber of Education as "insulting rather than celebrating for my race."
Residents now claim that the school degradation, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to embrace - I remember it - you embrace your teacher in the morning, you embrace your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took time until teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't take your white teacher, because your white teacher - I want to say there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many other Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, raised up over prejudices with light-minded self-confidence and quotes such as "How someone can reject the pleasure of my presence!
I will not understand.”
In 1975, Alice Walker travelled to the unmarked Hurston tomb and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, a well-known Hurston’s biography by Robert E. Hemenway came into the bookstores and it was rearranged into the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just in the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the lights of the ramp.
Former Hurston neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen to destroy its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
The state has withdrawn from the highway proposal after a few years.
“The five streams of the highway have resurrected, you would say they have directly exploded, real civil pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Outtowns such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to go to the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and the inhabitants began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named of course after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes act as a falling street in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s of the 19th century.
(Today it is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated cautiously.
Permission for most conversations is required to have in advance and certain things - such as wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church, painted by the white and displayed by the black on the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher who loves saturated red, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival grew, the domestic pride also grew.
Particularly young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his whole race: beautiful, with trouble and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, working, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's grandson, 18 year old Edwin Harvey, he sounds sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or with the police, which he says he would take some help.
And even younger, such as the eleven-year-old twin from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seemed to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, when they just go through there, think, ‘Hm, this city is nothing against the others,’ Alondra Kenon said on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we all talk gasily financially
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were staying away from the newspapers and huge TV screens on the Times Square, they would not realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never assume that in the glass-blown bees, the offices above their heads have every day bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers still rack metal wheels along the walks and carry muffin bakers for breakfast meetings.
The Hispanians are still moving between the towers and wear, like human mules, fifty wiped shirts that hang out of the wipes on their back.
Office rats are still waiting in front for their morning bagel at the street dining stations, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a daily day between the fourth and the seventh afternoon.
It didn’t look like a crisis until I, with all the talks about pessimism, decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this task so that it was covered with a late afternoon seest at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting on the front.
Not in front of the cash boxes to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the crossing where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starra, my “licensed personal banker,” came for the same reason as me.
However, compared to me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They picked out money from the so-called thrifts (a little similar to building savings), money associations and from those kinds of savings whose branches operate only in one state, and who claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the last year, 15 such banks silently failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, went into bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers returned home for a weekend on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets of $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The staff of the offices and shops who stood in front of me and feared a further collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe port and that does most of the rescue on Wall Street.
People in New York have learned a lot of money over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke in the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and to her overwhelmed executive officer, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity as if she was cracking on a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed about fifty-year-old homewoman of my teenager, changed the topic of our ordinary conversation - Brada, Angelina, or my food gifts.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the funds of the money market.
I’ve moved it, I’m not going to risk.”
Muslim tombs destroyed after Austrian right-wing breakdown
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Philip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang participate in the demonstration that presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry ceds similar to traffic labels that show mosques scattered with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of disguising a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which the extreme right-wing parties achieved enormous profits in general elections.
More than 90 tombs on the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linza were sometimes severely destroyed between Friday evening and this morning and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The guilty sprayed on some tombs Jewish symbols such as the star of David, but the detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to hide the motifs of extremists led by hatred to Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "heavily shocked" by the news of the dissonation that comes as the Muslim post month Ramadan is approaching the end.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering the round of searching for its own soul after the right-wing traffic has broken down in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which got together more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Free Party, which gained over 18 percent of the votes, protested against the shakes and burks in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods in which the relationship with Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna he talked about the "European Brotherhood", which is intended to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis conducted immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right on the position of the strongest political block in the country, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel overseas.
Garry Glitter, the glamrock star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, was banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he planned to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police agreed on the ban on travel last Thursday after it gave evidence to officials about Glitter's past sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford's Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the judicial service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at the Ashford's Lowest Criminal Court, the Kent police requested an order that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd personally did not participate.”
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as it is recorded in the register of sexual assaults.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also report the scheduled date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he had forgotten the obligation to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police announced that they will not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible routes throughout the district.
A spokesman for Kent police said: "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who will stay in the UK, because here we have extensive systems that manage potential dangers more effectively.
The protection of the Kentucky residents is the highest priority for the Kent police and we work carefully to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual assaults to minimize any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnam prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he went to Bangkok, where he had to start a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel good, and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass pass check and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he left back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in west London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order that ordered him to register as a sexual assault.
Glitter was previously sentenced to four months in prison in the United Kingdom for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master outside the scene." - Günther Bauer - photographer
No clothes, no clothes, no clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of the flamenco, distracted from the focus on interpretation - only so I will the liberated expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
The second is man.
Unfathomable, if we ignore privacy, at those moments far from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of the letmo captured view or a passionate gesticulation of the hands, which are unthinkable, because they are not going to stand on the scene.
German Günther Bauer replaces in "Flamenco-people" the theatrical performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less known face of masters.
With this purpose, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of the flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the framework of the Month of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotografia Flamenca), "reflects the increasing international importance of Flamenco," says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that they are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portrayed “on the street” are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy... to the scene and completely capturing the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists it is not necessary to photograph on the stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Fascinated by the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying Flemish singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and material, remind classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic foundation of the image and leads it to the contemporary spirit, which is an idea that according to Bauer itself reflects the flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which never ceases to surprise and develop."
What draws the audience is not the action of the dance, singing or game itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, it was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists forms famous flamenco characters, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology and will soon be a book edition that will contain portraits.
The passion for portraying brought Bauer two years ago to the idea to repeat on the "SportARTproject Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer acknowledges that "to photograph people, to know them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter into their lives - that's my passion.
I think in photography the portrait is the hardest genre.
A person encounters or encounters people, personalities that they sometimes don’t even know, or give him a few minutes to photograph.
Despite the similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery of El Fotómata in de la Mata Street 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa acknowledges that the novel he writes is "troufality"
It takes place in an unknown environment and tells about the events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project - just working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for twenty years and traveled in the Amazon.
The eternal favourite of the Nobel Prize for Literature, yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, admitted that the project he is currently employing is "a trouble" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I't do it, but I'm going to do it and I'm sure I'll finish it once," he concluded his post at the Ideas, Thoughts and Words Exchange Festival, which in four days saw around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city of Aquaducte.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the most popular writer - Dickens' old edition "Our mutual friend" -, filled the theater Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Felix Rome, who introduced him, he had a consigned audience before him, to whom an hour of time passed like water - the Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a notorious dose of humor remembered how in him, from the original "incredible adventure" from "the pleasure of the passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I lived", a literary mission was born; how he supplays "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinated", carefully arranging the text, repairing and repairing; or how his writings have influenced Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "memories" are the basics of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, escaping experience" - emphasized Vargas Llosa with the fact that according to him "to work on people" and "to drive them to try out of the line", and called on the writers to "do not be subject to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of the climate, the celebration in Pozoblanc is missing.
The show with copies, which closes the ceremony in Pozoblanc, was canceled yesterday morning after the announcement was confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
Therefore, the company, together with Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermos de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez, decided to cancel the bear matches.
Disadvantaged weather conditions suffer this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain stopped the course of the two planned bear matches.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista had to build the bears in the arena in Castilblanc.
This is the way it was celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and a reward for dynamic and aesthetically quality performance was brought on his shoulder.
On the same day afternoon, Alejandro Talavante replaced two wounds with a kick for greetings and one ear, which brought him rather uncovered seats in the arena than the Toreador art.
Even worse of that was El Juli, who passed the bear arena in Los Llanos untouched.
In the second round of the work without a single breath, he received sharp criticism from the majority of the audience.
They took control in Alavah in a carrier with two thousand kilograms of Hashish
5 in 10 minutes.
Road control Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
The staff stops two people in the car and they run away.
The cargo, more than two tons of haish, is not to stop.
According to a report by the Internal Committee of the Basque government, the officials were persecuted and arrested by one of the people in the supply, a man aged 38 years, who was identified as A. A. J.
He was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road inspection on the N-1 in places where it crossed the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the supply for the purpose of checking, but the driver did not follow the instructions, sharply accelerated and took away.
The members of the car began to persecute immediately, until the vehicle stopped near the landscape a few kilometers further, at that moment both passengers jumped out and fled into a forested borough.
The members of Ertzaintzy eventually caught one of them and captured 2,178 kilograms of Hashish, which the suspects carried, as it was revealed during the Iveco Daily shipment survey.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighting of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark is "compressed" and disagrees with the data listed in the delivery documents, the detained was therefore also charged with falsification of state documents.
Ertzaintza continues the search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape, in order to finally determine the origin of the captured drug.
Arrested A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to deal with appropriate formalities before he subsequently proceeded to further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under drug influence
Actress Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing unusual maneuver when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Road Guard told the People magazine.
The witness explained that around 16.30 Locklear "proudly slapped on the gas, for the noise of burning, she walked forward and back and tried to get out of the parking place - when couving, she had a few times sprinkled the sun glasses."
A witness, who did not know the actress first, saw Locklear a moment after she stopped on the nearby highway and came out of the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When a police guard arrived at the site, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
"It looked disoriented," and therefore the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit the test.
According to the police spokesman, the actress cooperated and excess alcohol was later excluded, yet “we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was visible to the police at first sight.”
Locklear was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of the closer unspecified substance and around 19.00 was taken into detention, although it was released for several hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic, where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
IU Chief and United Left Deputy Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of former Council of Youth and Sports Council in Seville Francisca Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of negotiating in favour of his family, will depend on the district association of the party.
“I’m too a federalist, it’s on the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers,” Llamazares suggested the negotiations, to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
The head of the IU, however, insisted that in the case of the investigation of the illegal action that Silva committed, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "The IU has always fought for the maximum transparency of similar matters."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict ethical code for all public functions."
The Blood of May (Sangre de mayo), Garci's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "The Blood of the Flower" (Sangre de mayo), to which he was inspired by Episodes from the national past of Benito Pérezo Galdós, revives the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the film maker wanted to “imagine the narrative of the characters and the analysis of society,” which he always admired in the work of the famous romanopisce, explained today together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the film before a large team of interpreters.
The May Blood with more than two and a half-hour metrating will be introduced to the cinemas this Friday and in the future more than a four-hour TV series is scheduled for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of Galdose's literary creation, José Luis Garci claims that by filming this film he fulfilled the "child dreams", which is thanks to Esperanze Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to film for the twenty-year anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer with the fact that the story will be based on the Episode of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means for Garci a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "the tremendous Spain, which mistaken in the leader for which it was going to fight - the struggle for independence led during Ferdinand VII's government to the collapse and retardation of the country," he said.
The director, however, regrets that he can’t count on the financial support that got to the films The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goy’s Ghosts – almost twice the May’s Blood – so he couldn’t film some scenes from the scenario signed at the same time by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he works almost throughout his film track.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver a empezar) works as he is usual - on the scene along with the actors he usually tries with before filming and which he does not choose by casting, because it seems "understood" and also believes that "a part of the director's profession is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and thus to know what's happening in the crafts he is engaged in."
Many of the actors he chose for the May Blood appear before his camera already a few times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Biliary and the last selected Blind Sunshine, does not represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "this will only appear."
For this film Garci does not expect any awards.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for what’s going to be after, but then you realize that you’re working only for earnings, and so you’ll be able to make another film in addition,” Garci explains with more than 30 years of director career.
Isabel Bayón resumes the spiritual message of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
Sevillan dancer flamenca will give up the honor of another Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of the Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of the Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dances and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a passionate life, she was the pioneer of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the korset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the inter-war Europe of Isabella Bayon, was fascinated.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested me this character - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not about telling her life, but about capturing the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So my "bird dance" evoked guajiru or "shark dance" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance corresponds to this aesthetics as well,” she says.
The show contains the involvement of two exceptional characters: with Miguel Povedá, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in La puerta abierta, and with the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined the collaboration with her former student.
“Matilde represents the older Tórtola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has received an offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me.”
The show also contains the music and guitars of Jesus Torrese and Paca Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the bubbles of El Pájara, the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artists, who are the primadons of everything and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place in her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her and even less then appreciates her creation," Bayón says.
The show begins today at 20:30 in the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The newly married book closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The New Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government for the celebration of "The Zenobia and Juan Ramon Triennals" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennale is coming to the end with the new edition of this work, the international congress that will be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the tour exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun's Light", which was opened in May of this year, and after surrounding various Andalusian provinces, it should be moved to New York according to plans at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also ordered eight hundred printings of "The Newly Married Diary" edited by Pedr Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the most sacred Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn’t like it.
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without bad intention" and under the weight of awareness that Newman left, reveals her unpleasant vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
See how long it took for them to get the Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He knew he was seriously sick.
He was a boy for all.
"Sometimes what a person feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said in tears Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid that he would be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of the film and the homeland died in the especially dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, in the time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when desperately seeking reasons for pride.
When times are harsh and people without virtues and just a few of those you deserve to admire - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodies the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for losing and winning cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on the honor of the first-born son who died from overdose to his own brand of domestic food and bio-food.
A full treasure for the country, which cost a lot of effort to get rid of the suicidal food culture.
The stormful wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, who won the Oscar for directed by Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the peak of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
“That liar has placed a very high layer for all of us,” says George Clooney, one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lived today – he relies on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even not possible.
But fortunately such people are and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough chances of not being.
“Why should I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?” he liked joking.
Let him in heaven be accompanied by the pride that there is a coexistence between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not so common in America.
It is said that "from all the great roles he embodied, he was the most sacred to the role of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a sacrificing philanthropist."
Incomplete matches of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us desire to hold the Olympics in Madrid, and after a failed year 2012 it will be possible in 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we’re running the race yesterday, I’m saying no!
It was talked about him as a perfect race, and according to my judgment he was the worst I’ve ever been on.
Such a snush of absurdity that as soon as the evaluation occurred and I was testing, it would be clearly insufficient.
Let’s look at it from the beginning, one after the other.
The foolishness begins with taking the race number, because of which a person has to go out earlier.
It doesn’t seem bad to me, but when you’re already going there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent overfillment of the track).
But not.
Here you had to first pick up the number (first foolishness, go there just because of it) and (after standing the appropriate front) - what surprise! - they had only a shirt size S (second foolishness, because I need size XL).
Where are we living?
This is because of the crisis they decided to buy only small t-shirts, because it is less material and are cheaper?
Well, that’s little compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the front on it lasted over 15 minutes, the bag had to be delivered there.
More than 35 minutes of waiting time lasted, which is something uncomprehensible at the race, where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as we could expect, the race started and we haven’t left our bags yet, and when it’s already succeeded, with taking it was much worse.
Moreover, the waiting extended the rain for 40 minutes, leading to a general rebellion and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchial inflammation tomorrow and some, like me, will not show the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, as I guess, didn’t record me the right start time.
Of course, if someone asked me for a perfect race, this would not be meant.
So I think we’ll just have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a reception (virtual)
At the conference on new technologies MIT, Microsoft presented further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system on a way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move throughout the company's campus) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptor" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
They can also classify the present according to conversational groups.
On the demonstration video, the receptor records a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that speaks to him and that he is not a company employee.
She asks her if she’s going for someone, and she tells her that she’ll take care of her in a moment.
This is the blue screen of death.
Awesome .
This is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, for example, a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot has been discussed about a change in Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found out that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial unnecessarities, they would be five times more powerful – man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a hrom when we consider that Microsoft version from version adds new features and other "extra" to Windows.
Changing the direction would be a meritful act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing meaning and the same software is on it.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who tended to the theory that it was Google’s first step towards a competitive competition with Windows.
Many legitimately pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your daughter.
That is true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as the absolute truth, but as the relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more attention to the Internet browser.
The computer is activated to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the internet than around the windows.
What is the half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They are desperate, and I have a small example.
I made this photo in one restroom for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drinking machine was a poster that asks them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the internet.
Last week it was confirmed by the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count until 2010.
Microsoft will try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay expensive.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore him on the Azur Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shines in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the "Motor" of Francis Ford Coppola, and in addition is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to put ourselves into the list of his life roles, we can dive up to the picture of a typical muscle with a spicy knee that lifts the bricks in the carcass circus.
Basically, it’s nothing more than a typical cotton male underlying, adjacent and without gloves.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all the others.
First of all, for his crazy name - although popularly he is called 'Marcel' - which has a connection with sport because, as the legend tells, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
"Marcel" stands out above others with a high quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (very untouchable) Belgian flag, which the models of the most emblematic bodies have as detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company is not only specializing in tank tops.
It also produces miciny college, retro boxers, kashmir sweaters, cotton pants, marine t-shirts, children's clothes, mini-cratches...
Thought pieces for a comfortable underwear.
It’s a bad thing that they’re just underwear.
They are too beautiful.
“I want to be a young mother; whoever becomes a father does not worry about me.”
The great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small characters, is a woman full of life.
Their new acts in fashion are now taken by the Sisters of Cruz very seriously.
For Monica, it means much more than just that some beautiful, famous girls will lend their name.
In Paris, the promotional event that Mango organized in its new headquarters took part, as well as the announcement of the unimportant fashion awards that this Spanish company sponsors.
He is heartless and unwilling, and he will get you close.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to introduce the new collection that we and our sister Penélope proposed for Mango for this season autumn-winter, and at the same time I took part in the announcement of the second year of the Mango Fashion Awards and dinner in Opera in honor of Valentine.
It was a challenging, but at the same time an exciting day.
What is your new collection for the Mango company, for which you are working for the fourth season?
I and my sister love films from the 50s and 60s and we’ve taken many incentives from them.
I also like to travel around the city and observe women walking dressed, how they combine and lay their clothes, I do it very often.
You are a dancer, an actress, a designer, so a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but in the end everything is connected and has many connections.
I liked clothes, I still wanted to go to my grandmother, talk in my aunt’s closets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a journey.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
But you know that we dancers are based on how we are adjusted to feel good at our classes and tests when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect to designers and professionalism.
You’ve been 30 years old, you’ve had a crisis?
where to.
I feel better than ever before, I am 30 years old.
I find that the woman is already ready, has experiences and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I am doing what I want, and it gives me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body requires it, and in addition I want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss it.
When it comes to my father, I don’t worry about it.
But one thing I know, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
When it comes to the movie, you are now waiting for a few premiere of the films you made last year.
It’s so and I’m looking forward to coming to the cinema.
I come from the theater world, so I’m very impatient and impatient, I want everything right now and that’s, of course, not going.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Of course, how much you will like...
A few days ago you had your premiere on a showmole alongside Naomi Campbell, right?
Do not say that.
I don’t want to go up as a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me and invited me to London to take part in the charity shows for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes we showed - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - went out and the revenue was handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don’t know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things that are told about it, and because I know it, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
In addition, I will stick to the good in which he is engaged.
She asked me to show for charitable purposes, but when she asked me to make a stand, I would do it too.
For the women of the third world I will do what is needed.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that will prevent him from starting the car drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal came to know in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its objective is to return the drivers behind the wheel, so the drivers will also have to pass the course of transport re-training.
In addition to the National Traffic Safety Office, the General Directorate of Transportation (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers accused more than once for driving in drunk again in this state will sit behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the level of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the start of the car if the driver fails to breathe before or if the alcohol concentration is higher than the permitted.
The price exceeds €1,000 and the guilty must pay it.
A study conducted in this regard in the U.S. in 2007 showed that in vehicles equipped with this device, the infringements were reduced by 65% during the first year following the introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measures are limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it results in a criminal offence.
And to help its implementation, since the legislation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of the criminal provisions requires a change of the law.
The equipment is not yet available in any sales version on the Spanish market, although it has already been tested in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
It is tomorrow that the Parliamentary Congress will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without “peeptoes”
With British accuracy, at 17.40 p.m., as it was scheduled, an aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in Mexico D.F. in which the Prince and Princess of Asturia arrived.
The sun just sinked, but its rays have yet forced the eyes to close their hands to see the successor's pair coming out of the plane.
Under the meetings stood a Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess are coming to a state visit.
- Yes, so it’s great, it’s not going to get to the airport to get people... She’s from here or what...
“No, no, she is a Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
Yes, so it is...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which forms 27 naval soldiers ready to shoot the honorary salva.
The prince appears with a smile on the lips in a dress of a dark blue color and the princess, very variedly dressed and with broken hair, has its usual "peeptoes", apparently she was that in D.F. there is a storm threat.
Before they go to the hall, where the official delegation is waiting, they smile to the photographers and unnecessarily call them.
At the door of the hotel, where they will accommodate one of the four largest in the city, a spoken Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Best Supported Fashion Price
Per there is no more suitable place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris and there is no more prestigious designer and bonvivana than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidized by €300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, saw her proposals in the Manga exhibition on the Haussmann Boulevard number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried with an impression.
Of course, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and was just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is located in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designers Valentine for taking the presidency of the competition jury, caused us to eventually take a pleasant dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango’s ceremonially decorated chair table looked a little more amazing alongside the most notable Chagall works.
Nati, who, with her heart-breaking sadness because of her brother's recent death, did not reveal anything, dressed the clothes of this brand and the jewellery of ELAH, above which the breath was hidden, and hanged into her son Luis - a almost two-meter elegan - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at a dinner for his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and as a real gentleman remained with the baron Rothschild without a stick, because they both offered them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived in the shop in - own-designed - pants and shorts and on dinner was dressed in long black sexy dresses, took a night walk to the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the ballet exams hall, and remembering other times, she took one of the bars and indicated "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stop visiting the side buildings of the palace, but before leaving, she showed us photos of her son on a mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to love the presence of Oliver Martinez – another young man riding on a motorcycle – and John Travolt, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and towels and asked in advance not to use any odors in his rooms.
The stars under the stars of the Paris sky.
Oh is there, c'est la vie.
1001 - Anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and angry everyday life.
And so that it is not a little, all are summarized in one book that will bring relax to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm climbs every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the accelerated rhythm that today’s life brings.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is no one or two methods to fight everyday exhaustion and to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number is no bigger or less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott out of yoga positions, classical massage and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book gathered a whole "menu" of options, adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 ways to relax" and thanks to the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone thinks it is impossible to peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "guide" denies this opinion.
In addition, it offers additional procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you have no adrenaline in the veins, which in the body re-establishes balance, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the sofa, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and chili tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, you may be crazy, but in fact it is meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvie.
It is very common, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly no one of you was told that at night he spoke out of sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fever), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the next day the child doesn’t remember anything.
There is not only one reason to explain its occurrence.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nocturna (night aiding) or meshness, but it may not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stressful or irritated situations.
In any case, this is a little overlooked phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak with a quiet voice, say individual words, scream, or exactly the opposite (writing, crying, long speeches...).
In cases when it manifests with great strength, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist to find out if he has any problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We have said that it is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by remembering a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the child before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV shows or series.
For very nervous children and those to whom the work is relaxed, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them get some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep calmly.
When somnilokvie appears, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and that from what happened, the next day he will no longer remember anything.
Useful advice
Do not be him.
It’s useless, because it’s not at consciousness and you interrupt him sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and thus rests.
Remember that if it seems to you several times in a row that it is very troubled, it would be advisable to ask for advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If he understands what he says (which is not so usual), avoid the temptation to question him and pull information from him.
It will not be useful, because when he is sleeping, he is not conscious to arrange his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you don’t know what he thinks about, and therefore why he says that, so be very careful about how you interpret information and what conclusions you make.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s nothing wrong, it’s just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern, finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory after a long weight loss period.
Without playing a big match, the yellow black created more chances and managed to win one of them.
The game did not have a too fast pace during this confrontation, in which the attackers were hard to pursue.
After the first attempt of the captain guest Kauffmanna, who shot from a distance just a flaw passed the conjunction, began to have Illhaeusern slightly up and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the contrary, built a defense wave in the middle of the field and left only the agile Riahi on the hole of the attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, which was cared for by Marais, well situated for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
But Gólman Illhaeusernu did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his fellow players in weakness.
Dannemarie, however, failed to get out of it, and the eleven of Illhaeusern, which was just a little pulled down to "highten" the defense, did not cause any greater trouble, except for the last seconds of the match, when the ball after a great confusion fled very close to the bridge.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before the flight to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a trip through Britain.
To face the demonstration of the fishermen's strength, which on Monday violated the accessibility of several Bretton and Normandy ports, the French president decided to go on Tuesday morning to Guilvinec port in Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter appointed promised that it will be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and hope that it will "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the “crisis committee” created by Bretton fishermen in order to take measures against the drastic oil price rise, which has reached a peak exceeding an average of 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, “the president will talk to them about the solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and payments of sailors.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is fishermen expected with impatience.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out an operation of the "shell" (operation of slowly running vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing 10km constipation.
The resort port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Island were not interrupted.
In the Quiberon Peninsula, a filtering ceiling was operated.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, when on the morning in front of the fuel stores in Brest and Lorient, tires and palettes were burned, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Canal de la Manche, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trailers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisica in the Loire-Atlantique region during the evening stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they eventually decided to negotiate, until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry.
The “crisis committee” will decide on Tuesday in Guilvinec on how to continue the journey, and on its participation in the prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state fishing department, which did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue” because “fishermen will not leave anything” and “they don’t want to arrive in Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the diesel tax are currently paying around 50 cents per liter, but they judge that the profitability threshold of the ship is achieved only when the oil is below 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman is great.
The unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also praised the legend of the film and the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that rises over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, keeps its supply expectations for 2008 with 215 supplied devices, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially taking into account the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
AIG says it plans to transfer 15% of its assets
The American International Group, whom the U.S. monetary authorities have received over the water, is considering to transfer more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion that had been given as a deposit, the Sunday Financial Times writes.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, the newspaper, which quotes sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
The Board of Directors of the AIG, according to the FT, met on Sunday evening to examine the possible postponement.
It was not possible to obtain any confirming statement from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to get rid of include its air leasing affiliate International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and investment in private equity, FT supplies.
No final decision has yet been made on these submissions, FT continues.
AIG must quickly get cash in order to be able to pay back the loan of 85 billion dollars granted by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk that the U.S. authorities will confiscate 80 percent of its capital, while at the same time discarding the current shareholder’s appropriate ratio.
History of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
The biggest point decline in its history (of 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the rebuilding of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to final data after the closing date, 199,61 points and stabilized at 1 983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Collected since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally fell down after an unexpected rejection of a plan to save banks by the House of Representatives, a plan that was intended to enable to find a little stability on the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide the funds he requested to the Secretary of the State Treasury, Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is unable to adopt a certain plan," Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial believes.
“It shows how much the market relied on this plan,” she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days will not come “too late.”
“If this project is indeed condemned to disappear (...), the staff will be immediately transferred to the Fed and other central banks to burn the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, Global Insight’s chief economist.
And with the emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings the fall of one financial institution."
After Friday’s collapse, the Washington Mutual authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly turns back and demands immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that the markets are not “only faced with the American crisis, but with the global crisis,” FTN Financial said.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The 10-year cash output declined to 3,632% compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, the 30-year output to 4,161% compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House followed the second debate, the task of which was to find out who of the couple John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The headquarters of the Republican and Democratic campaigns did not be surprised when both announced their victory in a television duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in the surveys.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey published on Saturday attributes Obama a five-point advance (49 percent against 44 percent for McCain), judges that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the non-defined voters, Obama is the winner for 39 percent of the respondents, while, according to a CBS survey, 25 percent attribute victory to McCain.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and the only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It’s talented,” said Bill Clinton on Monday.
The 70-year-old McCain constantly highlighted his irreversible experience in the field of foreign policy, while emphasizing the "naivity" of his opponent in the issues that formed the core of the first confrontation.
“It seems that Senator Obama didn’t understand that...” the accusation was repeated.
“I don’t think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become a president,” he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, the Republican television spots have been carried since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it is the future.
He didn’t lose his head and showed himself short and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama did,” a democratic spot said last week, accusing the Republican of not taking sufficiently into account the impact of the crisis on the “ordinary American.”
"Thro the nine-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said before 20,000 people gathered at a presidential meeting in North Carolina during a sharp rain.
He didn’t even say the words as “middle class” or “working.”The financial breakdown clearly benefits Obama, who Americans consider more suitable to save the economy on the edge of the gap.
“The next week may be a decisive turning,” influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama’s “economic transparency” to what Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight-year bad economic policy, how it was conducted by George Bush and how it was supported by Senator McCain."
The Senator of Illinois again confirmed that despite the unexpected springs on Wall Street he should succeed in reducing taxes to 95% of the Americans, and also pointed out that the realization of the country’s possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions related to the $700 billion financial aid plan (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress yesterday night and which is highly unpopular.
“What do you see that there were any elections in Minsk?”
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night in the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday after the closure of the electoral rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the president’s regime: “dictator, resignation.”
Some acknowledge that they didn’t even go to the election: “What would it be if they do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which was friendly to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including the visa prohibition for 40 Belarusians and the freezing of some assets, could be abolished if the elections are considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
“We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in voting,” said Juri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” emphasizes Aleksandr Milinkievič, the former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, “because it’s important who counts the votes, and we’re the executive power.
If some opposition members come to parliament, they will be appointed and not elected.
But their entrance to parliament can mean space on television, meetings in regions and bills.”
The opposition, therefore, feels obliged to participate in political functioning, because “there is a need to begin dialogue with the European Union.
In fact, if our economy, deeply liable to Russia, is affected by a crisis and we do not reform, we are threatened to become a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the course of the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
He emphasizes that the participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of premature voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
“What do you see that some elections were held?” asks the social-democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
“There was no foot in the election rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in the parliament, those who most fit the regime."
The night’s silence came back to the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate for the success.
The Blood That Is Again Certain
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly glad that Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the trust of the public, which was seriously shocked after the polluted blood scandal in the 80s and 90s.
As generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross transfusion committee was contaminated by the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Due to this drama and the wave of public misconduct, the Canadian government in February 1994 launched a public investigation, which was chaired by Judge Horace Krever and which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not repeat.
While Judge Krever wiped up with the report, some provinces launched a committee aimed at planning a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebec this role was held by the Gélinea Committee.
According to the Gélineau and Krever report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be managed by Québec, and the Canadian Blood Company for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
“When Hema-Québec started its activities in 1998, just 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
“The situation was disgusting.
With continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area over the coming years, we have regained public confidence,” he says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008 Hema-Québec was trusted by almost 94% of the Québec population.
Dr. Decary, however, does not lose the mind that “confidence is something very fragile.”
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
"Then we were witnessing in Europe the occurrence of many cases of human form of disease of crazy cows, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says a woman who has led the company since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore rely on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which in the case when we don’t know it and when the spread of a serious disease is on the stake, in this case of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, is necessary to take exclusive measures.
In April 1999, therefore, we rejected blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safe to prove that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode, therefore, showed us that keeping the principle of caution was meaningful.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detection of HIV appeared on the market: tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect in the donor blood directly the presence of the virus itself, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests used before were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the foolish period between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, the specialist explains.
We could shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and without getting to know it.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of getting HIV-infected blood is now exposed to one in 12 million people.
In other words, this means that before someone is infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product appears.
I think that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary to heal,” said Head of Headquarters Hema-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what pathogenic element can appear in the system.
Just last year, the island of Réunion discovered the chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by bumping insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Decary, stressing that in addition to safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
“The needs are growing because the population is aging.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or blood plates.
The ageing population also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which in average consists of only 3 percent of Quebec people who are allowed to donate.”
Every healthy person aged at least 18 years, meeting the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of blood donors are unaccepted because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country where they are injured, they are excluded for a year.
With these 3% we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
The deficiencies are very rare.
Members of the donor network, however, should be supplemented proportionally to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, convincing people to donate blood is difficult, especially then keeping them and encouraging them to become regular donors.
“Life is so unconnected today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” Francine Decary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart clots, eye bulbs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed, and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Québek, which also manages the only public blood bank in Québek.
The pulmonary thread, which was previously considered biomedical waste, flows with blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood samples in the bank and we expect to take over a thousand each year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,” says Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program as a very popular one.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to it," as Héma-Québec has not enough funds to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québec.
Football - Impact in the semi-final
Impact Montréal qualified yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and at the same time decisive match of the quarterfinals played for the total number of goals to the semi-final round of the USL first division, thanks to a 3:1 victory (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders from Seattle.
Deputy Antonio Ribeiro gave a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the second half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to deal with Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Remember that on Friday, during the first of two quarterfinals, the Impact in the Starfire Complex in Tukville, in the suburb of Seattle, suffered a 2:1 defeat.
Impact will match his strength in the semi-final with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening in Minnnesot, Thunder matched the deficit 3:1 in the home match and eventually won 4:3, but Whitecaps still advanced to the semi-final round with a total number of goals 5:4.
Impact is expected to face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details about the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's victory goal
The first three Canadians are ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrey Kosticina last night in Centre Bell encouraged an attack to win the Canadian 3:2 on separate attacks.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev gathered one record in this fourth triple victory of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during the separate attacks.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russians said.
“I need another match to feel good.”
“In the first quarter he tried to manage too much,” said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a good praise.”
Charest bet on the north
The Prime Minister says he will call for early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the end of the Congress of the Liberal Party (Parti Liberal) Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Québec, where in today's complementary elections the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) candidates.
"Oddown the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually attractive way at the end of the Quebec Liberal Party summit in Levis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were displayed behind his back in a kind of image mill.
On the three enormous plates run a slide with remarkable images of hydroelectric gardens, down, Québec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
This is the same way as in the pre-election period.
In a press conference, the prime minister refused to exclude that he would trigger early elections in the autumn, although he noted that he had a very busy program.
The "Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister plans for Quebec, the vision of a "new economic space", which includes the workforce agreement with France, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Ontario agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the north territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of the presentation so far.
The prime minister, however, limited to explaining why the North represents a "glass with huge potential", but did not specify the term, the amount of investments, or a clear priority in future projects.
He highlighted several approaches to points that could be further divided: mainly water power plants, forests, but mainly the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's list, contains "nikel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This “territory twice as large as France is with us”, “is in Quebec.
And it’s not only with us, but it’s in us,” he emphasized, as if he wanted to show that he calls for a certain national founder myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister highlighted: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James' Bay.
"It's our, it's our future," he added after theatrally silenced to look at the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, covers a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all previous governments.
“There is one border line that has long been unconvention, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,” he said.
Otherwise, “in the context of climate change it is also necessary to reflect on our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the north-west transition, which will be opened throughout the year due to the thinning of the glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory becomes a duty.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuites?
He said that the Quebec government will be very attentive to them and that the project will benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist MP from Hungary), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was initiated by the Inter-Ministry Committee, which is chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Traffic and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be drawn up."
The development of the North should be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as fluently following the vision of the liberal prime ministers that preceded him.
“Like the liberals that preceded us, we changed our mindset to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the still overwhelming topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a great cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's entry into the party's headquarters.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to cross Beauharnois' center on the Adélard-Godbout coast.
“From Godbut who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the Nationalization of Water Electricity, to Bourass who created the Bay of James, our party has been able to shape the future,” Jean Charest said.
At a press conference he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely to the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When the line came to Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stressed that it was planned to launch in 2012.
"I'm saying it only between us, but I'm planning to be there," he entrusted his membership base, causing a significant compliment.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there will be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly even in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of raising elections in the autumn of this year, which is permitted by the law.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially with the Federal Council missions in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the leader of the liberals a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "strengths to amend the constitution", which passed very smoothly: the PLQ (Quebec Liberal Party) demands the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint a part of the Canadian Radio and Television Council members who would have the right of veto in case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the Northern Plan in its main features was accepted skeptically.
PQ (Parti Québecois) chairman Pauline Marois resumed the North Québec Development Policy, which Landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, she renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she adhered to her, "we would be on today," Marois noted alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Francis Mercure.
ADQ said it will support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we hope it's not just a theater," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is back from the holidays today.

It was Vic Toews, the former "Justice" (or irony) minister in Harper's cabinet who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour in the summer of last year that he was a "shame" for Canada.
In this way, insulting a woman who has led an endless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, it tells a lot about the Prime Minister’s surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government in front of us, which, as the only of all Western countries involved, has not brought back to their homeland its citizen closed in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
The government, which did not take into account that at the time the actions that were to be committed to him, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-sold in unhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the guilt of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers are defending the repatriation of Omar Khadra in order for a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little depends on the fact that this young man is psychologically destroyed next time, undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don’t realize this, but we are just witnessing the flourishing erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy”, the words that Harper so much swallowed and which sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him according to the will of the boss to the minority government (as it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in the party that proclaims Honor, Law and Order: they don’t see that this government has renounced what formed the reputation and seriousness of our country.
It is a shame, Mr. Toewsi, in this abandonment, and not elsewhere.
Orwell's Discourse by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir printed a letter to Patrick J. Garver, the executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell’s logic, he confirms that the world’s largest gold maker has begun the prosecution of three authors and a poor small publisher for honour insult in order to trigger a “transparent public debate” and demands six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they will not judge truth, especially in the case of prosecution for insult on honor, but the law.
It is not surprising that Garver completely misses this fundamental resolution.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, to bring down anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process will happen, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectful amounts to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced struggle with an army of lawyers supported by almost unhealthy pockets of the mining society.
The tactics in these unbalanced struggles, in other words, often consists in destroying the defendants in order to implement a reconciliation procedure that will take the mouth of the opponent and, in addition, frighten anyone who would dare to deal with this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it had to present its view on the whole matter to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate is in normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, and not in the wounds of the obesity.
The mining society, therefore, is not enough to open its books, its documentation and set up a real debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole matter.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no trust in the public opinion and shmahem rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Per Garver could explain how he could demand a “public debate” and at the same time deny the opinions of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president’s world refers only to fat-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, the Nazis have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution, in which the prosecutor should be stuck in the mouth (in the framework of his prosecution “public debate” Barrick, by the way, just submitted an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
If we ignore Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom of investigation and the search for the truth, which is essential for every democratic society.
In general, it denies the right to quote trusted sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that are the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If it will be impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could form it if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to guide debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated appeal clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has not the least desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit this type of unlawful prosecution.
Operation to Save Wall Street: Democrats and Republicans Understand
Bush’s administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the largest rescue economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, using $700 billion to remove the financial crisis that has been hurting Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control of the elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the deposited public money, new measures to capture the number of houses caught due to non-payment and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to the managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiation table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
“We’ve made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything was done so that the real economy and the ordinary Americans were safe from the crisis just on Wall Street,” the Democrat explained.
“This is a key point: if we don’t do it, trauma, chaos and disturbances in the everyday life of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have gone to a maximum turn from fear of the effect, which would have a further failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both presidential candidates were later invited to negotiate and both expressed themselves in favour of the agreement, without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to seek such a extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama signed a supplement to the agreement on a number of measures, in particular the one aimed at allowing owners to maintain their residence, and the salary measures of the working-state leaders of rescued companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there’s nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of the television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes."
“The thick features I’ve read [how] that it’s something we all have to spend and with which it will be possible to move forward.
Choosing an inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to acquire for the money of the taxpayers doubtful claims and risky and non-sales assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the breakdown of a bubble on the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to another, more wider forms of loans (PCAAs) and resulted in the frozen cash and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The fall of the first draft agreement last week is on the conscience of the Republican parliament.
From the moment that the Democrats have come to the fact that for some “toxic” assets of troubled societies the government will only guarantee, but will not buy them, there is a belief that the uneastern situation is burned.
In an effort to close the contradictory opinions in Congress, a measure was attached that the government would be able to introduce new fees that would help it obtain its deposit back if the result of the program will have to recover losses for a period of five years.
The new plan expects to deposit the first amount of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
Additional $350 billion is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will gain shares in the rescued companies, which will pay dividends to him in case of profit and which will be able to sell again when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings for the confiscation of property related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits for the amount of assessment and compensation paid to the managers of affected companies.
The planners would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts spent, it is still uncertain whether their plan will be green.
On the other hand, votes continue to rise against this project both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“It’s absolutely obvious that Washington doesn’t hear you,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s financial committee.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, paying on taxpayers is not a solution.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen called the "committee of skeptics", presented the whole matter differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred valued economists, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to rush too quickly and carefully examine which path to go,” he said.
At the same time, Europe has reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced its withdrawal from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the edge of collapse since it lost €2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the risk loans crisis on the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, it is among the 20 largest banks in Europe and among the 10 largest insurance companies.
“These money will not come,” said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos.
In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that’s what the contractors and households can appreciate in these uncertain times.”
On the other side of the La Manche channel so far, the British government seems to have started nationalizing another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to take over all existing loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) formed loans to buy real estate.
According to its last announcement, the Bank of Spain Santander will acquire its branches and accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with the blue eyes long represented his trumph, according to others weakness.
Did this American actor get rid of narcissism with a charming smile?
Yes and not.
The shamefulness, sensitivity, and the untouching talent that was his own, also removed him from the power category that produces true stars.
But what a long runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his farm in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less magnificent than Brando, whom he was similar and for a long time was somewhat his rival on the film plate, Newman was a more cautious actor, a fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it looked all this country in love with the self-made man, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in the battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television and soon in the film.
The same man, who fought for civil rights, was also a car rider, who was second on the 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also leave the shadows of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the swing of its own show-business, which will forever remain to a certain extent mysterious.
A good man in the greatest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused the hurt for film lovers, while his great roles compete together on the black plate of memories.
It follows more than half a century of constantly changing American Seventh Art.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a burned roof, the 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From the less ancient past (1990) we equip our sensitive Mr. Bridge, worried at an advanced age with a marriage that did not meet all the expectations.
So many other Paul's Newman have entered history.
The Boxer Rocky Graziano, a disappeared, violent, unforgettable criminal from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the Sign of Hate) Robert Wise, the role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 Newman revealed to a real familiarity.
Simpatic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for Best Movie in 1973.
The fierce and revenge billard player in the amazing The Hustler of Robert Rosen (1961), the same character will appear in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which will bring him in 1987 the only Oscar of seven nominations.
This face of the journey of the ages, it was him.
And again he.
In his career, various ages compete together.
Young people know him primarily thanks to the cult Slap Shot George Roye Hilla (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen's Brothers.
He finished his career as an Irish mafia master in the 2003 Road to Perdition Sam Mendes.
Unlike several film legends, which relatively soon left the craft, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with his blasphemy, excellence, and dismissal.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "for the live challenge of underplaying", judging that he had too much pressure on the pile in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as on the floor, the profession was not always so gentle.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lump and desperates whose falls and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed the few known sides of his shy sensitivity.
His film Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, provides a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, whom he lost due to overdose, was dedicated in 1984 to the film Harry and Son, a work full of sadness and sadness.
In the praise of honor to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former fighter Robert Redford (playing together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Genocide, love for life, such are the main qualities of the dead actor.
If we ignore his legendary career, a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of the Hollywood bankruptcy is also leaving.
His image we were used to see on bottles of wine ointment, sauces, cookies and other foods, which could seem quite unpleasant to us, although initially it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to his hard childhood foundation account.
Newman thus, rather than leaving himself coveted by glory, engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Every time and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was a honor that I could be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to watch the life track of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
And in addition, in the end, a model citizen.
What was produced in the factory Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings conducted against Jánosi Zuschlag and his companions.
The politician and his associates are accused, in addition to other crimes, including falsification of documents, of a long-term and systematic fraud by a criminal organization, resulting in extremely significant damages.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained in public competitions was used for their own purposes and the performance of the tasks was often proven by fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and the government — a total of approximately 65 million forint — was partly put into the Fiatal Baloldal’s cash, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The method, which the investigative authority also informed, was that the money obtained in public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual countervalue, and the association never received the commitments taken.
According to the accusation, a large part of the bills were false.
The printing of these invoices came from the yossefváros market, the round stamp was made in Kiskunhalasi.
On the name of which companies the production of the invoices is to be carried out, it was decided, among other things, on the circular road along the northern coast of Balaton, which was sent by Ladose János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, the first appointed was to look at pensions and restaurants.
In these, he requested accounts for his consumption, according to the model of which the accounts submitted in the framework of public competitions issued, among other things, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, by the Metropolitan Municipality.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his partner András Őrim, who, according to our information, often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study journey" Lados looked at one bedroom.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this hospitality facility provided food for a group of 90 members from the Biztos Pont association.
However, so many people, according to the company’s claim, would not come to this facility suddenly.
Similarly, the formal and content errors were removed by the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The Pension in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
The fillers of the print with a rich imagination, however, exaggerated this even when they pointed to the documents the company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the Prosecutor's Office, the documents sounding on the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even figure.
Győző Farkas, head of the company, said that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and showed his invoices, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the seal in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to formalities, it did not agree that, according to the invoice, a hundred people were accommodated, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the bill also included foods, with their restaurants not working for a long time.
Furious invoicing manufacturers did not even convince themselves that the outlooked Budapest travel agency organizes only foreign trips, and on the invoice with cash payment, which was also uncompatible with the invoicing practice of the company, they said stupidly as a service of travel intermediation throughout Hungary.
Furthermore, as it came out during the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, although the organization of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On the four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. did not agree, among other things, the amount of VAT. The activity of the company is not subject to the 25 percent, but 15 percent VAT, in addition, the staff of the hotel only issued printed invoices, but the facture made was written by hand.
In addition, the “publishers” destroyed the invoice, for example, by stating in one company, how it came out due to the investigation of the State Prosecutor’s Office, as the carried out activity of road transport of goods, which the company based originally on investment consultancy did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false, has also passed through formal deviations – inadequate to the invoice format and false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that the invoices were issued by them.
For example, the counterfeit did not notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation in the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating at it, and this is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that the paper would be issued by him.
The facts are made consciously.
The second group of invoicers are those who knew they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
Esély Budapestért Foundation issued accounts for approximately four million forint for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Socialisták.
The head of Collab s.r.o. was forced by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictional account.
With Zuschlag and its partners, Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices of approximately five million forint under which there was no actual economic activity.
Neither the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations forgot to indicate in their documents.
The other group of invoicing companies include those that had links to the accused.
For instance, Ivan Kubatov was a commissioned representative of the Ukrainian operator of the company Delta Trió s.r.o., which deals with fuel and motor vehicles, with its headquarters in Budapest, but the company is not to be found.
The company issued in October, November and December 2005 a number of invoices for the sale of computing funds worth approximately 18 million forint.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, to whom in the years 2002-2005 Iván Kubatov had to submit documents relating to the company as well.
As we know, during the investigation Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company he issued the invoices to the associations Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and himself accepted their countervalue.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian walls founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the companies did not work, according to the accused because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the were in his favour, since at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, issued in the name of the companies the invoices to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció attached to Zuschlaga.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forint.
The State Prosecutor's Office ruled that Kubatov came to 10 percent of the amounts listed on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time to the selection procedure for the Biztos Pont association, the man also used the Szi-Beri k.t. firm.
The associations Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted in January 2006 proposals for the public competition of the Mihálye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They earned over 500 thousand forins, but the amounts were not spent on the goals set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a home check in the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the process of making the invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
Interesting can be rather that if he decides to reveal everything himself the main prosecutor János Zuschlag.
His upcoming statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the payment of a large part of the damage, fifty million forint, with him the socialists have concluded an agreement and Zusi takes it on.
He may have been offended, since his requests to relieve the conditions of his detention, namely to place him in a house imprisonment, have not yet been heard.
While criminals who have committed much greater damages, which they have not yet paid, can freely go through or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Trumphing Psychology: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At the auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have managed to reveal to researchers from the Neurology and Economics Department of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don’t want to get behind in an eBay auction type competition, so they prefer to pay too high price.
Research using an experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers waged, the other group participated in a game auction, using the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) to explore the active areas of the brain of the experiments.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, the important element of which is to break the other side, the whole under the cortex of the brain, called the striatum, began to work intensely when losing.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-revaluation" mechanism of the nervous system.
The price scrolling is therefore, according to the researchers, possible to explain by an attempt to avoid a sharp striate reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team of economists conducted a financial cutting-edge investigation.
At the same time, there were three contracts against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply informed what the actual value of the product was, and they made the bets.
Additionally, the other group members were promised that if they get out of the game victoriously, they will receive another $15 in reward.
The third group received $15 on the contrary before the auction, but in case of loss, its members also lost the money.
Therefore, the difference between the two groups was all in the fact that one was emphasized in victory and the other in loss.
Members of the group playing "contra loss" were, however, willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These findings cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
These have so far explained the phenomena observable in the auctions of joy of victory and avoiding risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped us solve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now reached a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to look for a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name of hepatitis is a summary name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, characteristic is inflammation of the liver and yellowstone, but the causes of the disease and the disease caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the causes of the disease, spread in two main ways: type A and type E hepatitis through the digestive system (e.g. infected foods, water), type B, C, D hepatitis and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccinating against viruses A and B, against viruses type C vaccine does not exist.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal difficulties, desire to vomit.
Then, on the skin and eye whites, a yellowness will be formed, the stools will shine and the urine will be dark.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more severe type of disease, hepatic cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected is medically treated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells malignantly, so the first symptoms come in many cases until in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, regular depistation is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than the average: among people who suffered blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoo.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with the virus of chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should, in case of any symptoms of unknown origin, contact his practical doctor.
With timely detection, the disease is healable, the virus can be removed from the body, thereby preventing infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized worldwide by organizations representing the sick in 2004.
It aims to highlight the chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of timely diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God is not so painful.
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could facilitate death for already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, exploring how faith in God affects the perception of pain, the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of a fairly bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate a large part of the pain.
Through the technique that thoroughly examined the human brain, it was also shown that Catholics were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
Research is the first of a series of research, which, in addition to academics, participates scientists, philosophers and theologists from different parts of the university.
Exactly the test was conducted by attaching a flashing tool to the left hand of the experimental subject, which issued electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with Leonard da Vinci's border, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would trigger a certain state of worship among the believers, while the image of Da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the first and they thought it was a calming impression.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while separately monitoring the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said they felt “safe” when they looked at the Virgin Mary, as if they were “careful” and “calmed, peace was filled.”
When they watched a religious image, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strongly impressive image even in the atheists, only it is necessary to find the right photo.
“We should find a picture that they will perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright added.
After such great results, it’s just a question what effect it would have on the pain regulation of the believers if they show them some Madonna from Leonard or a painter of a similar calibre.
Would a look at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share with yourself.
On its 10th birthday, Google can declare that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in heaven above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what special examinations are going on, and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s chiefs, this is still not enough.
However, as regards the skeptics, which are parallel to Orwell’s dark vision, the nature of the Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather even more personal data about users, which is necessary so that Google’s founders can follow their original intention, which was: “Let us order all the information in the world!”
According to a spokesman for Google, even after ten years of worldwide work, the company is just at the beginning of working with all the information.
Asked what it will be in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What work would actually fit me?" - to such seemingly simple questions, however, the software will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all internet users well know that during the internet search, the searched words are accurately captured and from what IP addresses were searched and to what pages the interested people moved after the search.
Thanks to the Customized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep their surfing history, look back on what they searched and what they clicked, thus in the long run they generate findings much more directly to them – on the same logic the Recommendations service will be based, through which the system will offer products and services to us on the basis of the above mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I am dealing with? - users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the scope of the potential power represented by the company is terribly more influential, the counterreaction does not cause guilt consciousness, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all searched expressions are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example of recent times was a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from Orkut community sites, established through it.
However, Internet users, who are concerned about personal rights, could still rest in May when the company hand in hand with the electronic rights organization EFF successfully proved their truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google should not be forced, even in the future, by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully gained almost fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand searched expressions, which it obtained with reference to the strengthening of the year ago adopted Child Protection Act, yet it failed to get lists of searched items from individual users, respectively full lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view on Google is so quite contradictory: it is beat by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be damaged by starting to use the services of Google, and appear against it with the revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild foot, gathering around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see a new generation of big companies, “the company that is now cracking,” unlike its rival Microsoft, considered because of Windows as the conquerors of the world, even if they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require its users an identification code and does not want them money for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and program packages act as much more accessible, younger, “cooler” than the practice of the official software work.
However, this can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with themselves just one of the most slated keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing else than cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces behind us and use the communication channels we have available, and although their scope is different to each other, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young man can keep a profile on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which he can peacefully link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording his listened music, all this can then link to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to writing a blog on which will automatically appear his latest photo galleries, which he stores on Flickr or Picase.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she illuminates: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of common friends, easily find out with whom her crazy friend spent the evening, or a company can throw out her employee just because she tells her honest opinion about the top leadership on her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely re-assessed today.
The one who lives online life consists of what it will show out, so we could define the basic thesis hiding behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid Google's monopoly, has the option (from Scrooglem, which uses Google's search system, but does not deliberately leave traces).
Google’s online applications from a text editor to a photo editor and a news portal can be replaced with alternative versions that are not connected to the giant server parks and which do not make us the highest quality profile possible.
The public opinion is not too secretly expecting when Google will show the tears.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is more expensive than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening advertising agencies’ investments and the continuously accelerating services are seriously discomforting the lives of not only Microsoft, but also numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find controversy that makes an annoying impression: the top leadership, for example, completely rejected employees’ protests after he raised the corporate school fee twice, the employees’ frequent daily eating was too expensive, according to the company’s leadership, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google even in 2006 slept in front of the Chinese government and in the sense of their agreement filters any findings that are opposed to the good taste, respectively the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds that it never announces new services in advance, only when it can be used, but it’s certain that the expected problems of the next months and years can overthrow the world in new places: while some believe that Google’s project to scan and archive books and magazines is getting such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of its Health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database, then can serve as a good default material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel of Cory's Doctorow "Scroogled" describes with Orwell's reminders the future in which one can be terribly well approached only with the help of data from Google.
Two young people removed the traces of the double killer
Two young people were heard by the police in the case of double murder in Oz, according to reasonable suspicion they helped with the removal of the traces of this crime, the spokesman of the Supreme Police Directorate of the Borsod County said on Tuesday.
The persons have acknowledged the activity of which they were suspected and are currently accused of helping the crime.
The two young people, according to the MTI two girls, are prosecuted for freedom.
Assisting a criminal offence is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of a double murder in Oz, a 23-year-old man, was arrested on Sunday.
He is suspected of a previously planned murder.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old man owes a greater amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he pulled his borrower last Wednesday into one facility in Oz, where he first killed a man and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, which is also evidence that the murder was committed with a weapon hidden on the site of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros – approximately five billion Czech crowns – were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The fact is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the offer of the Poles is the highest amount that has been offered to interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse submitted the offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not exclude that this could lead to the extinction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts to be 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with an approximately 25 percent share, followed by the Czech Savings Company with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European papers
In their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deepening of the international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers already remind "third September 11".
For the global financial catastrophe we can thank the U.S. President, the Romanian La Repubblica accuses.The President was not even able to shake his own party to support that rapidly paid bill aimed at removing this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September 11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees a guilty in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the edge of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is constantly increasing, which will ultimately be paid by the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after Congress voting there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – just in the moment one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be overlooked, the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Individual states can still throw a rescue circle on curling monetary institutions and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
But if other banks collapse like the dome, then no money or further improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union move through their national egoism and unite control over the divided financial markets.
Only on Monday the postponing monetary institutions received more than €100 billion, the Vienna Der Standard reminds that the concerns that, like the Americans, the European taxpayers will have to go deep into their pockets in order to resolve the crisis, are increasingly realistic.
The European Union has not yet been seriously dealing with the crisis, which is like a tsunami on the old continent.
“Rescue workers” do not need to pay hundreds of billions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they fixed in a firm way in which case it is reasonable to take the money of taxpayers to avoid even greater damages.
Intelligent car imitates flight
What would probably be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, unless the imitation of the detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, in the bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC exhibition, was introduced to engineers from the Nissan company. It was about how to build a new generation of collapse preventive systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a biomimetic BR23C robotic control system, a robotic mini car equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate goal to help create a system that can eliminate any collapse.
“In the course of the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging,” said Kazuhiro Doi, the brand’s chief executive for technological PR and research and development.
An important role is played by the complex eyes, which allow birds to see in all directions in a view angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, the engineers sought the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters before BR23C in the 180-degree vision field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the board microprocessor that immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to imitate the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels in the scope necessary to prevent collision immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this moving maneuver is conducted in a completely instinctive way.
“If not so, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Tošijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety packaging, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other birds.
This process should not take longer than the blindness of the eye.
However, unlike the bees, this movement cannot go up, down or angle, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction by which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the infinite possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, in the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of rotative movement, acceleration and slowing was applied.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, meaning they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, instinctive, intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, the less then data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few input signals per second.
It is not necessary to store and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuver, therefore it constantly uses only a memory of a few kilobytes size.
It does not need memory with a gigabyte or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan’s estimates, could get into serial cars within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles on the road, would lead the driver to the end target.
The old child has a name.
The bill on a $700 billion economy rescue package, which is to be divided into several payments and aimed at the recovery of bank loans of poor quality, has already written form.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further talks, which ended until Saturday after midnight US Eastern Time, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days-long debate on a $700 billion rescue package, Reuters said.
“We’ve made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Chairman of the House of Representatives, saying that only the agreement remains to be signed.
The package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson on the result of the compromise stated: "The program will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the Asian markets opened on Sunday at 8 p.m. in the evening of Washington time (i.e. on Monday at 2 p.m. in the morning of Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
The draft legal standard, which is called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which the programme is to set up, will be voted first by the House of Representatives on Monday, then the seat will be in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, after the news of the deal was also welcomed in the White House.
“We are satisfied with the progress that was made tonight and we appreciate both sides’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, in which it was intended to spend a total of $700 billion at once on the purchase of low-quality securities secured by mortgages.
Now it is possible to spend in the first round a maximum half of the amount of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matter as expected will be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them securities secured by mortgages, which are assessed as poor, the fate of the remaining $100 billion then will depend on the decision of the President.
The program will be controlled by a special body, a member of which will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may, in the sense of the law, apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time buy low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, respectively, other "toxic" loans.
The purchase can also be carried out in the framework of the auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry said.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance program, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee on funds that are a reason for concern, for which then the companies will pay the price corresponding to the amount of expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary funds to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance or the prevention of the systemic risk associated with the collapse of any of the major monetary institutions.
“We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed,” he added.
The chiefs of the banks, who have come into trouble and are waiting for the aid of the state, can, on the contrary, count on the fact that the government will reduce their departure fees - which in the overseas slang is simply called "the golden paddle".
The limitation of their remuneration will only occur in certain cases, in addition, these limitations will depend on the way of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The limitation in essence means that if the ministry will shop in the framework of the auction, a tax allowance will be imposed on the golden paddles, unless the bank directors will be sent directly into retirement.
In the case of a direct purchase of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively proceed in order to ensure that money for the leadership is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the already existing gold paddles contracts will not change, the limitation applies only to new contracts, which is to be another incentive to participate in the program.
“This is the first case in U.S. history when a legal restriction on the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer will be in force,” said Barney Frank, President of the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee.
Furthermore, the state will have the right to gain a share in the program-participating banks, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since once the economy and the rescued bank stands on their feet, they can also earn on this transaction.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years the President must submit a proposal to the Congress to determine how taxpayers can reimburse the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also votes on both sides in connection with the plan of doubt.
“This is what the American citizens did not ask us, this is what the taxpayer’s dollars will not protect,” said Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman from California.
His Democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Kaptur judges that the provisions were urged by exactly those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Are you going to the United States without a visa next year?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a great hope that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Foreign Minister talked about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, “now almost everything depends only on whether an electronic system of road permits, respectively controls, will be built in time behind the sea.”
She also noted that there will be no entrance permits in the new system, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, who will deliver the Central Cross with the Star of Order for Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and will conduct talks with Foreign Policy Advisors of the Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday to support the government's $700 billion rescue package, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few-day marathon of Congress and administrative talks, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement on a package to rescue banks was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to overthrow the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree to be the most suitable of the two candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys at the same time as they came to the forefront of economic issues, Obama gained a certain advantage again and McCain's advance, which he secured after the Republican convention of nomination of Sarah Palin to the post of vice president, broke down.
Obama said on Sunday at a presidential meeting in Detroit he hoped that the 700-billion-worth package law will be promptly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
“We have to act immediately, responsibly (...) to your places, to your savings, to the entire industry, to the stability of the entire economy is in danger,” he said to the 35,000 people.
He didn’t miss the opportunity to call McCain’s ideas of economics outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC: "It will be a little overwhelming to everyone (...) but doing nothing is simply not a possible way."
As the Republican Senator said, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the departure for the top representatives he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no more important role in the negotiations, he himself, on the contrary, was in daily contact with the minister.
Parliamentary Chairman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press Release of German Language Area
The right camp is unbreakable, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyzes the weak CSU outcome in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haider are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the left German news magazine, Franz Walter discovers in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU’s erosion began much earlier than the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its office.
The Christian socialists have rebuilt Bavaria for decades—and now these modern citizens are withdrawn from it.
The change of periods is a problem for the whole Christian democracy, and thus Angela Merkel.
Debacle was not completely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process, which could be predicted for exactly ten years, ended: the unquestionable hegemony of one state party ended.
10 years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, in the so often reminded Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU in this country has consistently carried out and which is eating its parents.
The secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the Germans from the east and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without consequences to the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is unbreakable, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more self-righteous.
It is also clear that in recent weeks CSU has been the most distant from the classical civil layers; people in the freedom of profession, businessmen, individuals with graduation and higher education.
Thus, CSU’s support has fallen below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? the Chairmen of the Parties are withholding in coalition issues," addresses the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens still don’t want to agree on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything turns around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties have not allowed much to look into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is possible - in some federal countries and in social partnership exists.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current Chairman of the ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
The Schüssel-Molterer course was announced on every fall.
Repeating this direction is not considered.
Molterer responded to the red offers cautiously.
As he said, cooperation will not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still completely open in the party, these questions must be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ Chairman Jörg Haider again appeared open to all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibilities,” Haider said.
We must break the wicked circle of poverty and segregation.
The European Equality Summit, which will be hosted by France, the current President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People’s Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional negotiations in her message addressed to the Plenum, addressed the attention to the segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was launched - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was held by guest leaders, European social partners, the leading European rights organizations and civil associations working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the European Parliament group, Fidesz Járóková noted that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of labour, Roms are pulled out of the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
“The vast majority of young Romans have no secondary education, and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small portion of them can higher education.”
Járóková also emphasized that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to strengthen the consciousness of these connections in the broadest circles – between Roma and Roma children.
The earlier the Rom student begins school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income tax and consumer tax they contribute to the national budget.
“Romans are the right of their nationality of the European Union need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their non-quality and separate education,” Lívia Járóková said.
According to the deputy, the cohesion of the European Union with an emphasis on the objective and the action is necessary in order to accelerate the processes of the desegregation of schools, which is primarily important for the proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
“It is necessary to break the wicked circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Rom children the opportunities given by the democratic space, so that they can participate as full-righteous citizens in the future of Europe,” Yáróková said.
Everyone is guaranteed by the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" the objective of the European Summit of Equal Opportunities, held annually since the last meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination set at the European level and at the national level.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided in late October.
Despite the shameful election debacle, the debate on personal issues was still delayed by the Bavarian CSU.
The party chairman Erwin Huber and land prime minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their places, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party’s extraordinary congress on the last October weekend.
Members of the highly criticized duo, in any case, let themselves hear that they will not stick with all their strength on their positions.
Thus they tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the “Bayern tsunami” personal consequences.
Five years ago – the truth, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber standing at the top of his career – the Christian-social union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but its strength was only 43.4 percent.
The CSU has been a “self-governant” in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP for 46 years.
Although the conservatives in the southern federal country, which has a key importance for the Hungarian economy, continue to have a high position, they will be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of the narrow intelligence team, which will start the sonding talks on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-oriented group of Free voters, will also be the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered the possible successor of Huber.
It is an irony for the fate that the candidate for the Free Electors came to the parliament by Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to make a coup, but then with an ambitious municipal politician they made an immaculately short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how Beckstein stabilizes.
In the transitional period, the active role will also appear to Stoiber, who until now has arranged nits from the background, the former country prime minister and former CSU chairman called September 28 the most suffering day in his political career.
On Monday, Huber sparked a few sensitive comments on the CDU address, according to him, they would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, unfolds with joint forces.
According to Merkel, which was hard to hide its disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
This is, of course, relatively: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the social-democratic crisis continues.
The SPD reached the lowest outcome in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukasenko: Opposition - 110:0
No one of the opposition members came to the parliament on Sunday.
This can be explained by Russian observers by the well-being and stability ruling in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) by the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the election.
Although the 110-member legislative body of a 10 million country has been missing the opposition for well ten years, the opposition united in the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of the constitutional change in the elections with a controversial course in 2006 and for the fourth time to renew his presidential mandate, this time will " allow" to appear in the parliament several opposition members.
The ODS has also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition expectations was that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia – which took a loan to mitigate the impact of the constantly increasing Russian natural gas imports and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, which owns gas pipelines across the country, gets into Russian hands – wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where due to the Belarusian political establishment assessed as an anti-democratic Lukasenko and other high-level politicians did not receive entry permits.
The release previously pointed out that the OBSE, when evaluating the pre-election campaign, emphasized positive shifts, and not the shortcomings – for example, the ban of candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
On Monday, however, the OBSE’s lightning report already had reservations to the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press, especially to the fact that the opposition cannot be present in the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, the political system can only improve: political prisoners have been released for freedom and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow even in smaller confrontations, while it continues to refuse to recognize the separated South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms on paper a coalition state, has regarded these two territories as independent for a month.
“We’ve made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Alexander Milinkević told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, even though "the power has fallen to put one member of the opposition into the unimportant parliament."
In view of the results, the opposition does not plan a protest action, rather it is trying to deliver to the voters its message about the need for economic reforms.
“With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is blocked by local authorities, yet I see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the elderly,” Milinkević said, pointing to the fact that the Lukasenkov regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not consider the right or officially most supported layer of retirees.
“Because of the country’s debt and the growth of trade deficit, it’s just a matter of time when the social security ‘inducing the silence of the cemetery’ will collapse,” Milinkević says.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian observers assessed the election as democratic.
The head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States Sergey Lebedev told the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti that "People don't believe in words but acts", so the absence of the opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that the rotating door has been introduced when employees arrive and leave.
But from now on, this new measure will begin to work against smoked people, against those who drink and then go to coffee at work time.
The news was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renate Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Mauer Masi.
“Oturing doors – says Brunetta – are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services,” the minister said.
Now we are opening a new period of responsibility and transparency.
This is a reformism,” Brunetta emphasizes.
The Chigi Palace will complete the introduction in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the staff, the Secretary-General assures: “It was a common process with the staff and the cooperation of all.”
In short, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a good cappuccino at seven in the morning."

In Rome, the minister will finally announce that over the course of three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people per year at work.”
He added that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient.
“His salary dynamics has doubled over the past 8-10 years with regard to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered to reject the standards of the Brunett Decree in accordance with the request supported by Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration today will present figures related to lower absence at work due to illness – writes the Consumer Protection Association – the nation of ‘uppressed linen’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees who have gathered together to declare war on the illegal norms contained in the decree.”
In Tara, protests will be mainly against the exclusion of medical fees, which are dependent on activities; the extension of the period in which the patient can be checked, in which time range control visits will be carried out, and against the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Employment Accidents, Napolitano: “Resolute Prevention”
Every day there are 2,500 work accidents in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanent disabled.
According to Inail, in 2007 there were approximately 1,200 deaths from work accidents.
These values indicate the severity of the incident, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes twice the deaths compared to murders.
In order to regain the attention of the institutions, social and media on this dramatic issue, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of the Victims of Occupational Accidents established on the second Sunday of October.
“The annoying data spread by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of work safety is,” the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms in a report sent to President of Anmil, the National Association for Morded and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the state expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint efforts for safety at work, for the protection of the wounded workers, for the assistance of the families of the victims and for the participation of the public opinion.
“Naturally, an angry ‘tough’ has been raised, honestly shared face-to-face with tragedies, which in their scale trigger disturbance in the media and the participation of the public opinion, but the everyday reality again offers dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly the problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
The numerous initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance, so that young people facing the world of work gain clearer awareness.
It is necessary to notice this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social severity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
President Gianfranco Fini, from his part, emphasized “how the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolute critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state.”
“As for the work accidents data, it seems that they show some positive turnover, but it does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from the work accidents is in any way alarming,” said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t just want this ‘success to decrease’ to lead to less attention, because at the moment the attention stops, a tragedy will explode.
“We believe that in general there is still too little to do to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase the controls and inspections, but also to interfere more strongly with the training of employees, right from school age.”
“There is still a need for further efforts – he added – with regard to communication and co-participation of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the employers is needed to face a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon.”
In the end, Mercandelli stated that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation expected for the working victims and a “release of support care” to which the system has reached in recent years.
“The goal is, therefore, to return the insurance guarantee to the employee, because the fate of those who hurt themselves should not depend on spontaneity or donation from time to time by the legislator.”
MP3 players accused of exposing hearing risk
Listening to loud music for a longer time and using portable music devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to the announcement published today by the European Commission, which in an official report extended in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Science Committee on health risks that have emerged recently and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
“This scientific opinion – we read in the notes – shows that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable music devices, more than an hour a week and keep the device at high volume, are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I am worried that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” Meglena Kuneva acknowledges.
“Scientific findings – continues the leader – have a clear risk and need to be reacted quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and disclose this information.
We need to continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery, so that they are fully effective and that they keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this problem due to the high use of portable music instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"The scientists confirm that there is a need to be concerned, and now the European Commission will, together with the other members and parties that have raised the problem, examine what measures could eventually be implemented and thus better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable music devices and similar devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but there are increased concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its belief, the Scientific Committee of the European Union states that users of portable music devices, if they use sound music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, will exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a longer period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves free course to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we will start, in March we will close, in June we will have amounts.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracall Baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will draw up guidelines for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipality will evaluate the analysis and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the “official seal” of Campidoglia and its counselor Gianni Alemanna.
“The Commission is entirely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included – wants to emphasize Alemanno – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political judges who remain Giunta e General Council.
It’s not about any exchange of functions, but just about an effort to have some place to process a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved, as this institution must have a precise timeline.
In June, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work carried out by the Commission on the future of the capital of Rome.”
To the one who accuses the Commission of unnecessary consideration that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: “All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, like the proposals of the Attali Commission, and I am sure that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics plagues on everyday problems and on emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that “this Commission is neither an unnecessary enterprise nor a blaf: it is completely free, the Romanian citizens will not cost neither the euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence that the capital has.”
For Alemanna, in essence, it is necessary to have a strategic design as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, so that it is possible to allow our city an authentic rise to the level it necessarily needs, and to think in a united spirit about its future.
The future, which, clarifies the mayor of Rome "will not be limited only to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status capital, but also "will include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama: The First Anti-American President
One famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy andined relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
The attacks on Obama are rising just as the date of the election is approaching.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has a boldness: he thinks he will get to the highest post of a nation that has two governors and five black senators!
In fact, these attacks don’t say much; they’re attacks of clearly racial origin and don’t answer the voter’s question: will he be a good president?
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
Some newspapers from Mississippi, from the U.S. south, wrote a comment: at least once in the electoral cabin we know well to whom the American patriot will give his voice.
One side of the American mentality, which remained stained until the last moment, will come out.
Say what you want, we’ll ultimately take care of it ourselves, who we’ll mark, whether Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama had to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been stated so far, it seems almost certain success of a black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a coat in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers were killed and the US was not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq has become a majority Bush’s weakness.
Whoever goes to the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: in the newspapers there is a period of investigation. and many accuse the internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center has questioned five hundred journalists about the status of their profession and the presumption of their future.
Nowadays, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say they were less concerned about reliability.
They don’t feel isolated like before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of the destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, are a huge problem.
According to the questioned journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved, whether we do not want traditional journalism to be substantially changed as the general public understands it.
The American journalist has a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Pressed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The larger publishers are driving the way to the internet, which many see as a “mortem” of printing.
The “economic pressure” that the journalists are warning has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists have admitted that they are using technology in the hope that they will “do something good for their journalism.”
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while on local level the value falls to 23%.
This has to do with someone’s “security of work”.
Leaders who think they will lose a job within three years is at national level 47%.
As for journalists, they are up to 30%.
When it comes to "sure work" related to staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and the internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s the question of taking or leaving.
Leaders get almost always huge wages and the editor can earn even ten thousand dollars a month out of paying pensions and insurance.
When it comes to holidays, the argument becomes complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to the reach of fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It is just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: Court in Rome, Danilo Copola remains in Grotaferrata
The President of the Second Criminal Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the submission of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferraty, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with an anti-offs in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released last week from home imprisonment, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked the real estate entrepreneur to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (which he spoke against) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon appeared a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against a rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a large portion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis disintegrates the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, more mild, friendly to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to “the Washington” and to the world of finance, strong primarily in the states in the middle and south.
A soul that arrogantly manifested itself by the vote I talked about at the beginning..
But this just quoted thing is merely an example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and not only here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe, this crisis seems to work as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, which in the new climate are tightened and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary market resuscitation, the double category of state-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed the crisis of banking financial institutions, which of course have strong bonds abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state are primarily included.
This has at the same time created a political problem for those who lead it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are among other things voters.
The crisis is economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of play or it has nothing to add: an obvious proof has been given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which is unable to choose for one common political line.
And so everyone awaits the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and most importantly the distribution of funds: at the moment we get into a tension, only the states have economic resources, a lot of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And they also own the necessary resources and authorizations to use them: two resources of extreme value, under certain circumstances which no market and no international organization will never be able to possess in the same extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on the state-national element, is in complete consistency with the increasing importance that the latest economic progress is trying to attribute to one factor closely connected to it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we entered the kingdom of silk, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance had already been predestined to rule the world, from nothing we realized that our future will, on the contrary, have to face more and more with such little immaterial things as water, grain, oil.
All things, who would be said, can be transferred from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to the bordered space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has much more cards in the handheld than whoever is not, and whoever has the luck that he lives in a place without grain, without diesel and without water.
I get to the second news, which, however, predicts a break.
Whoever speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
With regard to the economic crisis, it seems that two convergence phenomena are created.
On the one hand, the consciousness that there is an objectively need for authoritative leadership, the request for someone who could take the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditation towards the existing leadership, especially the economic, which has proved equally inadequate and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discreditation, intolerance, the feeling of inability and absence, which attempts to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
In fact, it seems that the beliefs are spreading more and more in the wide masses of the population than that their actions are the same as the ideas of the so far popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already overcome its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds out of the underground one branch, but a strong movement for the removal of ruling classes and traditional political arrangement manifests itself in sudden elections or in unexpected changes in collective mood in recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bayern to the fall of the Labourists in the UK, to the U.S. Congressmen's rebellion against Bush (and the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasingly problems to understand, i.e. to represent, which, not from today, is forming in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinforcing, growing, potentially overwhelming.
Before this, it would be overwhelming to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we can’t say that it means to have open eyes.
Super clothes to walk by the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to the super adhesive and in the future walk through the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various U.S. research centers and now a team of four institutes has been very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a hundred-kilogram body attached to a vertical wall using a label of just 2.5 square centimeters.
The American Science magazine published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of already existing materials that use a special carbon structure called the carbon dwarf tube.
“The foundation of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes placed as an arranged set of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the gekon, covered with microscopic haircuts, which enable the animal to ensure a perfect attachment.
Tests carried out on different materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these puzzles and at the same time"it simply leaves off the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive" will be provided by Liming Dai.
Per to walk through the walls like Spiderman? Per yes, but researchers think of much less fascinating use as a connection of electrical instruments, because the dwarf carbon pipe is the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications may concern aeronautical space engineering.
There are no superheroes.
Further Research – Also the University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to the research of a new adhesive.
In one article from the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a micro-fiber-formed adhesive as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving to the surface to keep the perfect adhesive.
Remedies: Never with Juice
Be careful with grape, orange and apple juice.
If you take these beverages, which are consumed primarily in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their intake changes increasing or decreasing efficiency with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London to emphasize the risks of both finished and fresh juices in combination with the intake of some medicines, at the current 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he raises a new alarm: one glass of grape, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, to cancel their beneficial effects and expos the health of patients to risk.
Grep juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to the toxic level of effects of some antiaritmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolithic, antihistaminic and neurological drugs.
This was by the Italian medical agency in a bulletin two years ago and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medications such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that remove drugs.
A long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
From here, the call of Michele Carruby, director of the pharmacological department of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries are mostly immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which eventually will arrange and exchange the information instructions for medications.
So always read the illustrative leaves of the drugs you get and if you find something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” said an expert for the agency Ansa.
Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novoken who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important critics regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, the days when Enron collapsed, Krugman predicted in a comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be much more important in terms of the consequences on the history of the United States than the first.
The forecast, which caused little controversy and which has been blamed for him for years, however, turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and shocked by how fast the collapse like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public’s interest,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenza Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great importance", but also a popularizer who has"very aggressive style, especially critical against the excesses of Bush's liberal administration".
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the release day of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source package of personal production that aims to penetrate to more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After approximately a year of voluntary work, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office appears to the broad public with a variety of novelty: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window are added to another, far more important, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
The focus is also on collaboration with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document even with the new Microsoft add-on (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the specific features of some models such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer the PDF folder to the graphic design model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrid" documents that resemble the typical Adobe format graphics and have the characteristics of a table processor or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has gained many improvements within the application programs: in excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to the comments so that the identification is clearer in the review phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should rebuild a definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the theme of free can be a tracker to expand in the households, it is on the business area of the Open Office package a lot to bet, and it can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a table processor that is aimed at replacing Excel; Impress for presentations similar to PowerPoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, in the end, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to 5 million downloads, and when we consider that to this day we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version it is possible that this predicted number can be overcome.
Coal results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: it is Rakušana Bernhard Kohla, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the T-shirt of the best topman.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider positive on Cer, Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohla blood samples fall into those that have been performed in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity on Cer, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohla on the Epo of the third generation is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he has already the outcome to the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the winning stages after the Spanish Carlos Sastro and the American Cadel Evansema, also won the pointed t-shirt of the best topman.
The New York Times says Italy is a racist.
Italy "as a country of immigrants only in the last house has become the priority target of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists?So it goes in one long New York Times article that dedicated this article to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy, and started with the case of the young Abdula William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case reveals what the New York Times defines as "the paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also "the strongest anti-immigration thought in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League."
To confirm the growing tensions between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by the Lega, which seeks to block immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is quoted as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend emphasized both by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the Church to work together on the defeat of racism."
Students victims of expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, unions for renters, renting a single bedroom can the student state in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“Jev has already reached such dimensions that the whole layers of students have lost their right to study due to the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear – explains the head of the Sunia Studies, Laura Mariani – in this city the high demand by students deformed the market in such a way that it stimulated the price rise process that spread to residents.”
In most cases, rental offers contain several violations: free contracts, unregistered, without limited rental, associated rental.
Sunji needs an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices thanks to the tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it is needed for one bed about 450 euros, for a single bed room it is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) through the average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the university, you need 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single bedroom, 450 beds in double bedroom.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single bed) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will only save if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single bedroom in the Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, for a bed it is 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single bedroom.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rental for students from countries outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of approximately 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italian.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the city ruins historical halls
The historic cinema halls are closed in favour of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is like a blind, it is like a face without eyes.”
The picture offered by Giuseppe Tornator successfully documented what is happening in the big Italian city centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of limiting the cinemas, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosals in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
“It’s like we’re losing a friend, a friend, with whom we shared a bit of journey and a lot of emotions,” the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that twenty years ago won the Tornator’s Oscar and the Grand Prize of the Jury in Cannes, and that tells the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness for the way of life that the cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anece, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the door has been closed by 316 cines of the traditional type, and the highest account paid primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna is first with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the emergence of the multiplex, are these three Italian regions that have recorded the highest number of new cinematic multisals: 195 platen more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian process has evolved irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of Anecu,"it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the already existing survive, because when one cinema in the city is closed, not all its visitors are willing to move into the multiplex.
Then let’s not even talk about the fund’s insufficient subsidy in favour of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would require between 16 and 18 million euros per year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city that is concerned with closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historic centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps in favour of operators and advantages for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to get into a zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and on some parking spaces.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to stand up against the great power of the multiplex, the traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more challenging.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a brick that convinced me to set up "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in the Nazionale Street, where I shared so many emotions that I don’t have to look at the black-pure inscriptions, I turn to the other side.”
Relationships between politics and the 'ndrangheta' mafia group, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city office elections according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The accusations that the Directorate Against the Mafia in Calabria raise against Mayor and Deputy Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, detained this morning for external cooperation with the mafia organization, are severe.
In the rail also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, a chief appointed, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as a healthy reason," the prosecutors wrote when two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to the lawyer Piromallim.
"So they would allow the mafia group to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the already enormous possibilities of control and management of public administration."
Calabria Regional Commission President Agazio Loiero does not hide that “there is a lot of secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his country: “There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndranghety, heroes who are still impurished."
The prisons of this morning follow after the prison of July last year, by which the police showed that the Piromalli mafia group had received the final intervention.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro was dissolved since 1991, the reason was even the then-presumed link between organized crime and the local government - the local politicians were deprived of the functions in the municipal government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of dissolution was elected as the head of the right center coalition after a closer election in May.
He screamed because of the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called to the responsibility of then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marc Minniti, and accused him of founding everything for political reasons, but judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even reached so far that it has requested a change of the A3 highway project.
Out of the further inquiries ordered against Dal Torrion, the prosecutors write, came out “the willingness to move the claims of the entrepreneur, the representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to the Piromallimu and to adapt the public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group.”
When energy is born from waves, the great ones enter into the game.
It is an infinite storage that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now beginning to be discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, flows, flows, flows are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the sight of colossals like Chevron, who is now trying to stretch his hands on these sources, has fallen.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price dropped around 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy went away. but now the ecological organization and the new increase in the oil price gave the sector a new impulse.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
This amount would be twice the amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear centers.
There are also flows and flows.
The Giants Attack.
The company that was waging on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than on traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – said a spokesman for a company linked to the U.S. oil colossal in the Economic Daily Wall Street Journal – and they are thinking about the possibility of working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering involves obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially if we take into account that the U.S. continues to extract oil in Alaska and that President Bush has recently come with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested amounts, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology is needed to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology that is still in the beginning, because it is unknown what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
Currently, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and don’t seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technologies with greater impact on the middle.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a fighting system that is connected to each other.
The power of the waves, which moves with the boya up and down, is changed by the help of wheels and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these boya.
The pressure dissolves the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy comes to the shore by underwater cables.
Currently, four of this type of facilities are in the project phase, waiting only for federal approval and a portion of energy could be used for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping center and parking space using six submarine turbines in the East River, New York.
The movement of water during the flow and flow causes the turbine to rotate, which the generator feeds with this rotative movement.
Verdant said they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorization due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the flow and after the flow.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of flow and flow, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is an unrelated factor, flows and flows are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
New York, Maine, Alaska and other coastal states have already invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and predicted $35 million in 2009.
