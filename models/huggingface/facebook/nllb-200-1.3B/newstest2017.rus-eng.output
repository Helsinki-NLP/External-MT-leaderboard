28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting: "Finally, things were going well for him".
The body found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galizia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death has been classified as a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a former Boston delivery line cook, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a close-knit family and he will be greatly missed", the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank was staying at hostels at first, but lately, "it was finally getting better".
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl", Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with the family was always to cook us a meal, to cook us dinner", said Luis Galizia.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
"With all the bad things that were happening to this world, it was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day", he said.

Italy 's public debt has risen to record levels
The size of Italy's public debt in June 2016 exceeded 2.248 trillion euros.
The central bank said that this amount is the historic maximum, RIA Novosti reports.
The previous record was set in May of this year.
The size of the public debt then reached 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year, Italy's debt load increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier, it was reported that at the end of 2015, Italy's public debt was 132.7% of the country's GDP.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, RT reports.
Scientists have analyzed the crystals of the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks using radiocarbon.
The largest shark, which is over five meters long, may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a shark's low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays a major role in its longevity.
Female Greenland sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are 150 years old.
It was once thought that the Greenland whale, a shark's "neighbor", lived the longest of all vertebrates.
The oldest known individual was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Russian Security Council.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made changes to the composition of the Russian Security Council, the Kremlin press service reported.
Earlier it became known that Putin removed the head of the presidential administration Sergey Ivanov, his successor appointed Anton Vaino.
Ivanov will now serve as the president's special representative on environmental protection, ecology and transportation.
Deputy Secretary of the Council Rashid Nurgaliyev was excluded from the list of permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
The Council includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Vaino, the President's representative in the SFSR Sergey Menaylo and the representative in the SFSR Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of his duties as head of the presidential administration.
By the decree of the President, Sergey Ivanov was released from the post of head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov is appointed special representative of the Russian Federation for environmental protection, ecology and transport.
Anton Vaino, who previously held the post of deputy of Sergei Ivanov, was appointed as the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to transfer to another job.
Is it worth going to a sanatorium if you have no health problems?
Our expert is the head doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired from work, should he go to a sanatorium?
We need health and recreation centers not only for treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get advice from a doctor on how to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"I'm just tired of work" is an important signal from the body, and it's not something you should ignore.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of the people who come here are stressed.
The most vulnerable are those in the big cities, aged 45 to 55.
So it's best to keep things simple and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern spas offer a comfortable holiday for the whole family.
So if you want to spend the holidays with your kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are well-being programmes, which include diagnostic services, consultations with a pediatrician, tests and treatment.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and therapeutic physical education.
The course of treatment is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, there is usually a children's club with animators, where children can attend games, various master classes.
Some health centres open their doors even to guests with babies, provide the nurses with the necessary facilities and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, long summer, abundant sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So you don't have to worry about the weather outside, especially since most procedures are done indoors and are not seasonally adjusted.
In general, it is advisable to treat people in health resorts twice a year, especially for older people.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region is, of course, the therapeutic mineral springs: Slavyansk, Smirnov, Yesentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various body systems.
Water varies in temperature, amount of salts, overall mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water according to the patient's condition.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers the level of sugar.
"Essentials New" has anti-inflammatory, bile and urine action.
The same effect is the water of the Slavyanskaya.
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he picks up less salt water because the salts retain the fluid, which leads to increased blood pressure.
Mineral water is a regimen: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a certain temperature.
Now, in health resorts, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are available.
What types of health care based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the salt lake Tambukan, the silt mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has anti-inflammatory, absorbent, immunomodulating effects.
These are wellness walks along individually designed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral spring "Narzan".
You can also take wine baths, pearls, iodine baths, selenium baths, saline baths, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
We'll keep the fruit growing.
What can we do to keep the harvest going?
It is narrated by Yulia Belopuhova, an agronomist and a dacha.
The tomatoes are now to be trimmed: the new shoots must be removed, the buds must be cut, the leaves must be removed, and the flowers with the small buds will not be ripe.
All tomatoes, regardless of their "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with asphalt-superphosphate extraction, processed with biological preparations (Dozrevalet - for accelerating the pouring and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamayr, Baktofit - from diseases, Immunocytofit - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacilin, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
In the late summer, only copper copper, colloidal sulfur and green soap are used.
We're doing the last watering of the plants.
The long-plety cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wall so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and Zircon solution, sprinkle the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
It is easy to extend the fruit-bearing period of the cabbage: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, and put fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against nighttime cold, place a curtain wall over the curtain wall.
Keep the plants open during the day and close them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia emerging from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive dynamic - in the second quarter, the GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This is the lowest level since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from the Russian state, the decline in the Russian economy slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development also recently announced a stabilization of the situation.
Ahead is slow growth.
According to the CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
"The index of Russian GDP indicates that the recession is behind us, and the slow growth of the economy is ahead", the Bank of Russia's "Trends Are on the Rise" bulletin says.
Regulator specialists have raised the modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter to 0.4 percent , and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 percent .
According to the Ministry of Economic Development, the decline in GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted decline in GDP was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15", - quotes the representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of RIA "Novosti".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that the "time is up".
Among other markers indicating signs of a revival in the national economy, Bloomberg calls the rise in demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of business.
If you adjust for the fact that the year is leap year, it's clear that the dynamics of the plus 1% of electricity consumption could be half due to the extra working day.
Add to that the lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and the plus-minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality", explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2%, compared with 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, for the last two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by the indicators from the real sector of the economy", Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April, the Russian Federation has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline of foreign trade turnover slows from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The situation on the labour market is also positive, with the unemployment rate falling to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5,2%).
Despite the good situation on the labour market, the question of real disposable income is a matter for the best.
In annual terms, the figure is down 4.8%.
This can be a drag on economic recovery, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy is more than 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's strict policies can also be cited as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which doesn't look good for the real sector.
The negative factor is also the insufficient level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015", - says analyst of the Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalisation of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly adapted in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners are representing Russia at the Olympic Games in Rio, then in most cases it is the natives of the former Soviet republics.
In Rio de Janeiro, we can see the opposite process - a fairly large number of Russians marching under the flags of other countries.
Each case has a different history of change of citizenship.
Some were taken to another country by their parents as children, leaving them no choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a spot on the Russian national team.
And someone thought that abroad would be better conditions for the development of sports.
AiF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The 27-year-old German passport says her name is Lisa the Red.
But before that, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps by taking up athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose the six-pointers.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to "move off the throne" Elena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be the only one of our country, even if she's a former, in the pole vault section.
Her best achievements in this sport are bronze at the 2010 European Championship and silver at the 2016 continental championships, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Piroshkov was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are evangelical religious propagandists.
It was largely because of their faith that they left for the United States when she was only three years old.
Besides Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started wrestling in high school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her training at the U.S. Wrestling Training Center under the guidance of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost in her very first fight.
But at the World Cup that year, it was a win.
Before that, she had won silver at the 2010 world championships.
After that came the 2013 bronze and the 2014 silver.
The 26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first learned about synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our trainers in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon she was on the U.S. team and had great results at the Pan American Games.
It's clear that on a serious international level, it can't compete with Russian synchronists, but for America, its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Kristina Shaldina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue her artistic gymnastics training overseas.
Until then, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the youth national team of that country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She didn't have to fight for first place on the world stage, but she made a real breakthrough for the U.S. by leading the all-star team to the Rio Olympics.
Another former artist is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Jana was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when she was 13, the family decided to move to Germany - there she had more prospects of getting into the national team.
Soon she represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, however, she was only able to take 17th place, not enough to qualify for the final competition in the individual championship.
But two years earlier, she had won a bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, but this time a sportswoman - Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration paths of the athletes mentioned above can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student at the Volgograd sports school.
Of course, in Iceland, she was instantly national champion.
True, Ira is trained in Russia - he comes to his homeland specifically so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she'd like.
Best place is 40 in the individual all-around.
There is very little information about Maria Ugołkowa's swimming in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a national record at 200 meters with a batterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4×100 relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, which helped her raise about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for her preparation for the Olympics.
The 31-year-old free-style wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavyrut managed to become a three-time European championship winner, Russian champion, Russian master of international class sports.
When he stopped making the national team, it was time to consider changing his nationality.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports pitches.
Batirov's triumphant return came at the 2016 Asian Championships, where he represented Bahrain, winning a gold medal and a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less well known in his homeland than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to practice sports gymnastics.
He did not achieve great success on the international stage.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the parallel bars qualifying.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
Born in Moscow in 1985, Nasté was only 9 years old when her family emigrated to Israel.
There, she continued her swimming training, achieving high results at the national level.
In 2014, she took 6th place in synchronized swimming at the European Championships in Berlin.
In the duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter is a member of the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the country's champion.
That same year he won the world junior championship.
A year later, Kreuter won gold at the Singapore Youth Olympic Games.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry also does long jumps and triple jumps.
Albert, 31, is another native of Hasavyrt who, after long performances for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sports, and in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR national volleyball player Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before his son was born, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there permanently.
In 2015, he won the bronze medal at the European Championship in his new homeland.
Hajiyev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and came with his family during the height of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but we couldn't get to that northern country - we had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelymhan continued his training in free wrestling.
Soon he won the world junior championship, and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only French representative in the wrestling tournament.
And again wrestling, and again ex-Russian.
This time we're talking about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain, about Taimurase Freieva.
In late December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently plays for the Spanish national team.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete had already achieved high results in Russia.
He won the bronze medal at the 2007 and 2008 world championships.
Tired of not being able to make the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last in our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, - Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been Canada's three-time champion, and in 2012 he became the world champion among youth.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the Pan American Games gold, his first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "Kazakh should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically".
They must grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But for now, I think it's a formal thing, and I suspect it's more on paper.
If the Cossack classes take all the positive things that have been accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everyone is going to go crazy, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are attacks on the funds allocated to the needs of the communal sector from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing and community sector.
As a result , consumers in the region overpaid energy companies more than 170 million rubles .
The day before, the Prosecutor's Office of the Krasnodar Territory also identified the fact of including in the tariffs unjustified costs.
And in the expenses of the LLC "IV-consulting" (provides cold water) were put 4 million rubles for the rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
And there are plenty of examples of this across the country.
People pay the last money for the "communal" and pay correctly, according to the Russian Ministry of Construction, the average collection rate of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged with several criminal offences: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds obtained by crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of city objects, Makarov signed contracts with entrepreneurs, the work was not actually performed, but paid.
Businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
As the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent it on his needs.
The result is millions of rubles in damage to the budget and residents.
The scheme of Makarov's machinations, alas, is typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions of the heads of the criminal justice system who were embezzling money from the citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, also a former city council deputy, continues, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, he established 6 management companies and 3 limited liability companies in Elizavo, Kamchatka.
One of them performed contract work for the UK, the other two played the role of cash-cashing centers, that is, they took money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not transfer funds to the energy companies, but spent them on himself, his beloved.
It's pretty hard to judge in the housing sector.
Things are not getting any better, they're getting late.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvotneva, executive director of the NP "Local Housing Control".
We don't have time to make one law work, as we invent a new one that should make the old one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, in housing and community development.
The lawyers themselves admit that housing law is not given much attention in higher education.
The prosecutor general's office is talking about refusal to prosecute, about the drag in the course of investigations.
Of the 3,5 thousand crimes under investigation in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
The rest of the investigation has been delayed, and one in five has been suspended due to the failure to identify the accused.
Often, the shortcomings of law enforcement agencies are attributed to loopholes in the existing legislation.
The law is there, but the investigators are in no hurry to start and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were opened.
In the last five months, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
What's a forgery of the minutes of the tenants' meeting?
That means the change in management, the financials and other issues are getting by the wayside.
And it also means that the housing market is not open to normal companies that want to work honestly, not to feed the population.
So, the residents are down, and so are the small and medium-sized businesses.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the entire state, - says Anton Zharkov, member of the State Duma Committee on Property.
And now this work is going on.
This is not just a one-off action, it is a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad situation.
Especially in the capital, scandals do not smell.
Why is there no housing scandal in Moscow like in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed iron will and brought order, - said Anatoly Vyborny, member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean the personnel issue, and the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
The management companies are under close supervision, and they've all gone through licensing.
The city's complaints are quickly resolved in the public space (and the appeals of the residents, and the measures of response are placed on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many do not simply pay the monthly receipts but carefully follow the listing of the house.
The awareness of the population about the rights of owners and the obligations of resource-providing and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of the tariffs for housing and utilities - a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I guess that's what makes Moscow so quiet.
So, it's against the wishes of the regional authorities?
Maybe the unwilling should change jobs.
The Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum to the United States, offering to choose between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to stop supporting the "terrorist organization of the Fethullahists".
This is not the first statement from Turkey that calls for the US to change its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt at a change of power in the country.
"Sooner or later America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO.
Either the FETÖ coup or democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice", Anatolian Agency quoted Erdogan's speech in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The Turkish president once again, but more forcefully, demanded that the United States fulfill his demand, which he first voiced immediately after the suppression of the uprising.
We remind you that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the uprising was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
A total of about 8 thousand people were suspected, including teachers and scientists, in addition to the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania, USA.
Also, Erdogan's supporters admitted that the coup could involve the Americans themselves.
The US denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement by State Department officials on this matter came during Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
But that doesn't stop the Turkish president from insisting on his own and also making demands on his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name the date of the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens", said Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik on August 9.
He said Ankara's amendment of the anti-terror law, as demanded by the EU, would put Europe's own security at risk.
On August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open borders for migrants in order to ease visa arrangements with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative statement by Cavusoglu was made last Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish foreign minister did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign countries in the defense sphere, - they import missiles", - said Cavusoglu in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member states, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have started looking for others", the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates Turkey's serious disagreements with the West and the country's reorientation towards the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see a completely obedient person in this post", the expert explained to AIF.ru.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about non-payment of EU compensation, about the demand for visa-free space with Europe and extradition of Gülen from the United States) he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on", - believes Minchenko.
The head of the Political Information Center, Alexei Mukhin, believes that the Turkish president will change his mind about relations with Russia as soon as it is convenient for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was taking a very tough stance on Russia and was looking for favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed.
No guarantee that the Turkish president will not change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
He will try to get the maximum benefit for himself, being between two poles - the West and Russia", - says Mukhin.
He believes that the main task for the Turkish president today is to maintain political power in the country, and for that he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin so that the US will stop supporting Gülen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached", the expert believes.
The head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glasova, is of a different view.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are currently tense, primarily because of the internal policies of Erdogan himself.
I think this crisis in relations will get worse, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the Turkish president, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, are saying that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, there is an active political interaction with Iran", explained Aif.ru Glasova, who admits that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is pursuing now is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively on the basis of the position of 'no problems with neighbors'.
The Turkish president has made very successful visits to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's positions both in the regional and international arena", the expert believes.
Glasova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relationship with the EU, and the question is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which may open its borders to migrants and create serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for new collective protests
Junior doctors have appealed to the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new labor contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the employment agreement agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in a secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government continued to be "persistent in silence" about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "Given the current situation, the head of the JDC has voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and has called for formal renegotiation of all your issues".
In response to the government's silence, the JDC leader today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuing program to expand the collective protests, starting in early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by young doctors this year, including the first general strike in the history of the National Health Service.
The leader of the BMA's junior doctors, Dr Joan Malavana, has resigned after voting to scrap the agreed terms of the employment contract that the BMA recommended.
He told the BMA members that the deal was a good one to accept, during the meetings in advance of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that this employment contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the sustained impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked stretched, and he barely exuded warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by contrast, has repeatedly referred to his "dear friend" Mr. Putin  five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the prolonged cooling off coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that moment was furious.
Mr. Putin erupted in a rage, blaming Ankara for Moscow's back-stroke.
The insult was even stronger, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media has been conducting a stunning, all-out offensive on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be blamed for everything.
The most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had made money from the illegal oil trade from the areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its own.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted from office last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There's also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The numbers have dropped dramatically by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They're putting the peak of the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television was predicting cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", as the Vedomosti newspaper reported.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her protracted dissatisfaction with the turtle-like pace of EU accession talks and Mr. Putin's move  who is seeking to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support from elected officials after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit in this glittering palace on the seafront allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the bad guys": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have substantial differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they didn't even bring up the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility and considering the possibility of total catastrophe when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter, it's definitely better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been backing away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed a bailout.
During this period, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds of sponsorship aid to international sports, from the Six Nations Cup in rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales all references to RBS, including external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that will get more influence  Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewing clients and employees on a tour of Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and something that our staff will be engaged in, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank".
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their respective demographics, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"This is a good time for us to move the brand bank, because basically (we asked ourselves) how are we focusing on improving the bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we were going to be a great customer bank and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of the customers rather than our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a win at Newmarket on the Prairie.
Dettori sprinkles champagne after a double at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori has secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Priestly, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in the smooth race.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm really excited because my family's here too.
I'm really glad that this happened in Newmarket, because that's where I moved 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not Royal Ascot. It's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free and very unpretentious.
Dettori receives a standing ovation when he brings up the mood after a win.
Two jockeys have achieved this mark in the steeplechase: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 wins in his career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it's no wonder he's reached a mark so few have before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical dexterity that sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a great racing pro, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he'd have brought in 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and big-time racing!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing winners to the UK for most of the last 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a dynamic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this remarkable mark with a signature swift jump off a horse .
From fast finishes to fast breaks, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many big-race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back into shape.
And he may not have finished for a while. Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least age 50.
Putin fired the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his administration chief, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's inner circle for years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Environment and Transportation Commissioner.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vayno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy in Tokyo.
He later served as head of the presidential protocol and government department, the Kremlin's website reports (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Is the smile convincing?
It's a move that baffled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters for a long time and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin that was shown on state television, both men said the head of the administration had resigned of his own free will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, that hasn't convinced many people here, especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, these are the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that the man once touted as a potential president suddenly wanted to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with a great deal of skepticism.
In comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, you could say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the chief of staff for the president for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He's a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become the president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after only three and a half years.
"Think Like a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with producer
Gibson was involved in a brawl on the set of a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on set and disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened", he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darth and Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Thinking Like a Criminal and have been putting my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of it, but now it's impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our amazing team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
It is reported that the show will return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: the fish landed in Banff's garden
A man from Banff asked for help identifying fish that had appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that 75 fish could be sand dunes left by a water storm.
Bain, who lives 500 yards from the sea, posted the footage of this scene to Periscope in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: the bridge is now connected to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern span to the Queensferry Crossing viaduct which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four joints between the "canvas beams" that are now coming to completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the Fife Bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bridges.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing the engineering of truly epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used to build this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the joining between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise assumptions for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the bridge's canvas is now in place, and for the final section of the canvas, the concrete is being poured into the Rosate today, which means that all the canvas is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first link in every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this twisting represents the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it to the expanding roadway of the North Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern  or shore-facing  side.
This was done by pulling the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale operation, but at the same time a very elegant one.
Scalable, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be raised at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
It's elegant because the spaces the team was working on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue at Moelfr Gulf: Three men 'lucky enough to stay alive'
Three men 'lucky enough to stay alive' after being thrown from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 UK time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
Three men struggled to get to safety as their ship continued its course.
"We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst", said the lifeboat's steward, Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, the strong winds had carried him away from them", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to the buoy without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a shore rescue boat and taken to a rescue station .
Jones said: "Three men who were thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but it somehow got loose from the man who was steering the boat when it capsized.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a dignified hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and gets them into some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to TV, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I'm, of course, referring to the underground hobby that is Pokémon Go, a character-based application originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, game maps, and other spin-offs).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, this all lost its relevance a little before this new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, smartphone gamers go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, when detected, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the falling passion by getting off the couch to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps the "average" person takes each day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported in the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people it tracks who exercise 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, they just see the initial data on the level passage.
Many health campaigns that encourage people to "get 30 minutes", "get out of the couch", and "be active every day" have failed because most of the health messages are boring and are delivered by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of other benefits that are too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out into the street to do what they love.
So, the three pillars of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring assholes looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might come through the door.
So what?
The breakthrough has happened.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our physical activity in the past, they haven't given us the kind of motivation to exercise that this game does.
The new stuff will come along, and the use will fade with time.
But with the success of Pokemon, more games will come along that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world physical activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simon Baimonalz wins the gold medal in women 's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the fuss.
Simonales is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic in the jump.
Freely on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast ascended to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, placing the gap between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under the watchful eye of the Olympics.
Her total score of 62.198 was a good distance from silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Eli Riceman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Byles of the United States performs on the gymnastics beam during the final of the women's individual all-around artistic gymnastics competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth American woman to win the overall championship and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps of all time.
She cried when her final score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare track and field athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to new heights:
Byles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
One final test was waiting in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the field, but between her and the load of over-expectations.
Anything less than heading back to my family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered an unwarranted expectation.
Simone Baimonalz of the United States, left, and Eli Reisman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual all-around artistic gymnastics competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming the beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retiring national team coordinator Martha Caroli.
While Biles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long climb to the top, that's not entirely true.
Part of her exercise program -- which includes her signature walk -- is set to Latin music that would fit right in the house on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and revealed by her mother to trainer Amy Burman during a visit to the gym where Burman was a trainer, became a force.
She hasn't lost an absolute championship since the summer of 2013 - a streak that's meant to last as long as Bales wants it.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
The gymnastics pole vault and free practice where Bails is defending his world championship are in an ambush.
She came out ahead again with 15,433 on the board and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Rysman hugged her gently as they waited for the final bill  pure formality  and tears appeared around the shiny red with white and blue eye sockets for Byles when the idea she had once recorded in the album for the cuts was realized.
Rysman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago when she shared third place but lost to Mustafina for the bronze in the tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call "Grandma", was way ahead.
She would send kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, surrounded by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the viral tweet from the 19-year-old earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Leiner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12 when their car was parked on the sidewalk, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car, then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple homicide doesn't appear to be the result of a robbery, as the perpetrator failed to take the wallet or $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to investigate whether it was related to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house", Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to disclose evidence that leads them to conclude that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were killed on the spot.
A witness told police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple homicide and is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and extracted a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly - the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which, in fact, is not true. Of course you're signing up for that", she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized treatment facility.
"My first response was, 'I didn't think people would do that anymore,'" explained Pixivto.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund has come up with for "please sing to me".
"We are teaching him sign language", Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language -- she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different things: genetic, such as Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It's too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional loss due to an uncertain future.
Did I tell you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't actually ask for a lifetime prognosis, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has some encouraging advice for mothers of children with Zika birth defects.
It's getting better.
You know things will get better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and flooding are causing rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi.
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana have forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected to fall over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from the shore and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid has already been sent to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests are coming in for high-water transport, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tanjipahoa parish alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning remains in effect through Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3.5 inches could pour into the area.
In southern Alabama, flood watch was in effect until Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Emit River near Dane Springs, both in Louisiana, were expected to record record flooding levels this past weekend.
Weatherman Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding downstream in the Assenshen Pass is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Morp Lake.
The Tickfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amity and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday outside Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another kid who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming", said Hansford.
It's gotten to the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the biggest flood she'd seen in the 48 years she'd lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members are disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with the help of an army truck and took them to the Gloucester fire station, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was over-saturated by the rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding have led to rescue efforts in the parish of Tangipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, CBS affiliate, reports that Tanjipahoa's councilman has reported 200 homes flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both flooding now.
Robbie Miller, the parish president, said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets from the high water.
Shelters were opened in the towns of Amity and Hammond to take in those who had been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water starts to recede", he said.
In the parish town of Hammond, Tangipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for residents to hand out in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Harrison County, Mississippi, the head of the Emergency Management Agency, Rupert Lacey, said that heavy rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
He said several homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.
Kate Towson, the manager of Shopper Value Foods in Aymith, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", said Towson, "and it still pours down to the ground".
Mahad Brown, 6, "bullet-riddled", survives after a shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, recording the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaad Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He was badly hurt, his little body was ripped apart by bullets", his grandmother Delores Meléndez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to be in first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Also shot three men: two 29-year-old and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Semi-automatic weapons, which were used in various semi-automatic weapons, were used to cover the scene.
It definitely seems like a long battle.
There were shells on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it looks like there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly looking through security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was shot in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabby and Lori
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, and for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts who are key players on this team: Simone Byles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Lauri" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many young girls.
The lineup, with Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, is a source of pride.
This team finally looks like America.
It also reinforced the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the last four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprise Olympic champion, and America welcomed her.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez, performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And my teammate, Eli Reisman, won the silver.
We're seeing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like that in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They're the "final five", because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's coaching.
But in reality gymnastics  is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train at private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents who pay for tuition, equipment, travel, uniforms, fees for competitions, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get the most out of their training, and that's an expensive and long-term obligation for gymnasts' families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Lori Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable, affordable gymnastics training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we've already provided free, low-cost gymnastics classes, located in Harlem, to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latino) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as endurance for strenuous work, discipline, and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive effect on good health, school and work performance.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Doing sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simon, Allie, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of Women's Power in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls from all backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors have taken it upon themselves to announce further strikes after Jeremy Hunt 's proposal was rejected .
Ministers hoped to end the debate over the changes by agreeing to a revised treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would hurt staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to their nighttime work and weekend hours to improve their after-hours service.
Dr Ellen McCott, chair of the BMA's Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly".
We're only eight weeks away from the first group of doctors being transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The attempt by the VMA to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to act and sometimes complete silence on the part of the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then junior doctors are clear that they're ready to organize further strikes.
The latest strike in late April delayed about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nursing visits, while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure replacement of doctors on picket lines.
Ministers hoped to end the debate over the changes by agreeing to the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The VMA wants better paid weekends for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, has urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: "Strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on already working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, nurses and their families".
Over the last two months, we've been talking to the Junior Physicians Committee and working with the Department of Health and others to respond positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate disclosure policies.
Employees hoped that the continued positive support on other important issues  such as staff allocation, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, the cost of training, mutual recognition of curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine  were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the terms agreed in November, February and May.
A £2 a day drug can reduce the risk of heart attack .
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to take the drug for £2 a day after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for longer.
The anti-reversible drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent seizures for people with heart disease.
It's prescribed 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another attack.
The NICE surveillance service of the UK National Health Service advised giving it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE surveillance service of the UK's National Health Service has recommended giving it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Heart attack affects about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Center for Medical Technology Assessment, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke  often with devastating consequences".
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By pre-commending ticagrelor, we're excited to be able to expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
As information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor  especially the risk of bleeding  after three years is limited, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond this time.
The PC culture allows for the falsification of voting in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Luthfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting a government report
The culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye, which has resulted in widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles is criticized by police, election observers and city officials for ignoring evidence of election violations because of "excessive sensitivity to race and religion".
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so strong that police should be allowed to put cordonings outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take IDs to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, voters just need to state their name and address.
The report even suggests applying unwashed ink to people's fingers when they cast their ballots, in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
We need to provide better protection for whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Luftur Rahman should be removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of believing Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were questionable or were the result of personalization, when a person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the mail-in voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are,
Its report states: "Evidence has been presented of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and youth, to vote at the will of their elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that . . . government institutions were condoning such behavior because of the overly sensitive "political correctness" about ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from postal ballot papers to stop the "harvesting of votes".
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter checks on registration to prevent the use of voter rolls for immigration and privilege fraud.
It is being considered whether voters should be required to show their identity cards before voting.
Use unwashed ink on people's fingers as soon as they cast their ballots to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To systematically check people's nationality to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with filled out absentee ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
Give the police the authority to set cordonlines around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff are making voters go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric lashes out at the city police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions", he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt  the criminal standard of proof  on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "check for the cheque" of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten that good reputation.
The crazy bike-like Kate and other celebrities from the Rio Olympics .
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prêvo, who turns out to be remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete competing for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous double , at least according to social media posts.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities that are appearing on our screens right now, FEMAIL has put together a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's twin on the bike path, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison caused a Twitter storm after images emerged of him looking eerily similar to the Wall Street Wolf star.
And in fact, the archer learned about the social media craze and admitted that he'd heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, except maybe the vegetation on the face", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think that's a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012, will undoubtedly be pointed out even more this year: the striking similarity between British show jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be an exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Chorus, Matthew Morrison, for years.
Moving on to the more surprising: This user believes that Nathan  is the "sports version" of the "Start" actor.
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer Yulia Yefimova from Russia can boast not only the same tanned skin and light hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like "the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Women in rough: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have the same face and eyes.
Not only: One Twitter user was very happy that others also saw similarities
Theorising: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similarity of the pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to express her excitement that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
In fact, the U.S. soccer star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons have included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which resembles the smile of "Get Success" star Gabrielle Union.
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
The analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth-place finish by 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay has angered CBC viewers in the live broadcast of the Olympics.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stink" and "died like a pig" while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
You could hear McDonald, who was brought in to the CBC commentary team to "color it up", saying, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby".
Too excited, started off like a stink, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79  1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rake, allowing the Canadians to eliminate China's lead.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC anchorman really just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'????"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
About Ai Yanhan from China in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby".
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron McDonald, with many calling for his dismissal.
Twitter users couldn't help but notice how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'This is #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russell, who was hosting the CBC, apologized on live television for McDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize for the comment about the swimming performance being aired.'
That was a bad choice of words, and we're sorry that it happened.'
The SBS concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
Commentator friend Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald .
CBC then copied and sent their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network has also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her personality.
And yet it was a misplaced and misguided choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on live television and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on his personality.
'I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.'
'Of course, there was no disrespect intended, and I'm very sorry.'
A Primark customer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store.
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped to try on panties on the floor of the mall in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she tried on her looks, pulled them out and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and ended up measuring four pairs of underwear at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone.
Primark Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed herself and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw".
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties from the shop window, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a place to hide to do it. She just stood there, shameless".
"Everyone stared as she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them, because she put them back on the shelf".
She did the same thing with three other couples before finally deciding there was nothing she liked, getting dressed again and walking out.
"It didn't seem like she cared who was watching her, "or that she thought about the person who would end up buying the panties she was trying on".
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home underwear that someone else has already worn and that hasn't been washed".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I'm guessing that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from the sale after she left - well, all the better".
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they haven't been washed".
A Primark spokesperson said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9".
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks With Cow Magic
The world around us is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little bit safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the New York Cowboy Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If you come from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you do is turn around so you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you squeeze the gun firmly between your forearm and shoulder before striking them in the face with your free elbow.
Then you kneel in the groin, and while the assailant bends over in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the barrel, and walk back, with the gun pointed at him.
For an armed man, suitable for the front, the method of execution is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip before you step back and aim it.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mirrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery... unless you're a master cowboy... is to give your cash.
For the traveler , Jan Wright takes his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler put his immune system and vomiting reflex to a serious test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Travel presenter and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, put his tongue on a euro bill, Piccadilly Circus railings, a train toilet flush button and a Russian pay phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before he licked each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is going to be a movie called "The Lizun Traveler's Guide to the Inner Power", has produced some amazing results.
The thought of licking a washer button on a train that thousands of others use may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his European travels, Wright spoke to doctors and medical staff about the growth of gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked gave him more than a bad taste in the mouth.
Wright became famous for testing his gut's toughness, traveling the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railway rails to toilet flush buttons, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said: 'From my childhood I was completely careless about my health and I would pull a lot of things out of the ground into my mouth, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he turned down was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test scan showed a luminometer value of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the hands you just washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer read more than 4,000 units, while his newly washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy company Valio have made a traveler's video called "The Lizun Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, like the toilet.
In the film, he reported, 'This is close to one of the worst things I've smelled in the toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything, because it's disgusting.
"Lisune Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength" was filmed with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company gave Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains sour-milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help speed up the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories at Valio, said: 'We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that would be interesting to watch and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming session that ended with, "let's call Jan".
They're saying that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about food, we wanted to put it in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way: I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were pretty tough.
I'm glad we got some of those licks on tape.'
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84 percent of respondents linked sour milk bacteria exclusively to good stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent said they ate foods containing added sour milk bacteria at least occasionally.
A family of thugs destroyed Saltach, Cornwall's municipal house, on the eve of eviction.
A family of thugs left their municipal house at a loss of £50,000 after they were evicted for bullying their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilock were evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, the shocked housing cooperative officials found the property in a state requiring repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the half-sides were opened, garbage was scattered on the floor, and the walls were smeared with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, a tenant at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he wouldn't be rescued.
She said, 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh, because this property is probably going to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family is in bad shape, and their name is in bad shape.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property on and off, and police report that the family's reign of terror has included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, arguments and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
In several rooms of the house, which could be demolished, found old trash
Floorboards in a house that used to sell drugs were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw street fights and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of their home this week after they were granted an 11-week extension to leave voluntarily.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into hell.
One reported: 'They didn't bother anyone.'
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is unbelievable.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet - we weren't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Group, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they called the police regularly.
Garbage and old toys were scattered down the overgrown side of the municipal building
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant has failed to take any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and the community of Devon and Cornwall have put in to come forward and give us the information.
I hope this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three of his sons lived in the house at different times, but he said they were all in their early 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms after the eviction.
Resettlement workers will now have to clear the piles of rubbish that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, related accessories and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was used to pay for a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were made homeless, it's been reported that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were smeared with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they're going to try to evict tenants who don't comply with the rental rules.
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel they can behave without prosecution, as well as those who are harmed by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane nearly touched the beach
In the Portuguese city of Aveiro, sun-loving tourists feared for their lives
The Portuguese Air Force 's P-3C Orion flew incredibly low .
The Air Force said he was on a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when the plane is flying low over the crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military plane flying at close range of the hunters on a sandy strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but without being able to see what was moving toward them through the clouds.
The incident happened last night near Aveiro, Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the shocking flight on social media, said: "It flew very low twice, and there was a moment when it seemed like it was going to break".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear, I had a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me".
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were terrified when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the plane flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires have devastated mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the thick fog and the smog from the forest fires that made visibility worse.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was tasked with spotting fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
The checks are getting more active, and the business is facing fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - the analysis of risks and critical control points - has been mandatory for use by food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the food sector in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
The Rospotrebnadzor's business checks for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But for now, officials only issue fines for certain violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulation will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASCP is a system for identifying and preventing food safety risks that was developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
Now, this system is used in all the food companies, not just in the United States, but in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, the HASSP has been operating in the territory of the TC.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HASSP requirement appeared in the technical regulation of the TC in 2011).
But business owners and government officials admit that most companies have never even heard of the standard.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, not to restaurants, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsaretelli.
Now everyone's trying to make up for lost time.
The expected time for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August - early September.
But they won't be a big deal, because their target audience - families with children - are already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday asking for charter flights to be allowed now.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of selecting a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, since most accommodation facilities in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea have already been booked by the end of September", the authors of the letter note and stress that the opening of charter transportation in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian sea tourism products.
According to the North-Western Regional Branch of the Russian Union of Tourist Industries (RUSTI), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, charter flights to Turkey can be expected to resume within a month.
It's not clear when the charters will resume, but it depends on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the planes can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly build programs and agree with the airlines on the necessary destinations", - says Pavel Rumyantsev, deputy director for communications and international projects of the North-West regional branch of the Russian Federation Transportation Ministry.
He said the possible resumption of charters is good news, but won't affect the market because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or are spending their holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are mostly bought by solo travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously", says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it now offers very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours", says Valeria Rosenthal, general director of the tour agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, there's no need to worry about the hype - most of the travel has already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsov also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no need to wait for excitement.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season", says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season", agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The tax code provides for the exemption from the tax liability of compensation payments established by law within the limits of the approved norms, related to compensation for damage caused by disability or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers employed in work with harmful working conditions is provided for in Article 222 of the TC.
The rules and conditions for the issuance of the certificate are set out in the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, milk or other equivalent food products are given free of charge to workers on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions, due to the presence of harmful factors in the workplace.
Based on these norms, the FNS of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of article 217 of the NCC of the Russian Federation, the income in the form of the value of milk given to employees on the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions is exempt from taxation by the NFDL in accordance with the norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No 45n.
Moscow's Gazstroybank was left without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license for the implementation of banking operations from the credit organization Gazstroybank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the GAZSTROYBANK JSC has been conducting a high-risk credit policy, which is related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks accepted at the request of the supervisory body and reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led to the establishment of the credit organization's grounds for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in conducting questionable transit operations.
The Bank has appointed a temporary administration for a period of time until the appointment of the Bank as a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
"GASSTROYBANK" is a participant in the deposit insurance system.
We remind that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the remaining funds, but not more than 1,4 million rubles in total for one depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the data of the report, on August 1, 2016 the size of the assets of the GAZSTROYBANK JSC was 335th in the Russian banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadisha Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is reported to have been killed in Syria.
Tasnim Akundiji's lawyer said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was killed just as she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of all this - like a gravestone and a will to others, that these are the risks that are involved in going to a war zone - is to dissuade people from ever making the same choice",  said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as the nominee for Supreme Court justice if elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he's convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she's elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, which President Barack Obama nominated him for in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the man who can replace the last Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call Thursday that he predicted Clinton would pick Garland "with some degree of confidence".
Representative Reed later said that he had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and was merely making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "swing the boat" with a new election.
Garland  Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "swings" and "supporters" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats claims that erotic calendars are for 'women as well as men'
Treats is partnering with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of naked celebrities, they set themselves the goal of finding the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I make it for women.
He obviously thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to return to the eternal and classic nude figure show where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
The Muscovites will be given memos about dishonest online stores.
Moscow is about to release a memoir that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in the Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the department's specialists are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure is divided into several sections.
It's going to be general information and the legislative framework, the rules for delivering goods, the ways to protect your legal rights.
The application will give recommendations on how to properly compose a claim and so on", - told in the Rospotrebnadzor.
The memo is currently being finalized.
It will be posted on the website of the Russian Federal Consumer Protection Agency in Moscow, and a printed version will be distributed to the people of Moscow.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement naming the second suspect in organizing sabotage in Crimea.
People from Ukraine and Russia who helped prepare terrorist acts have been detained.
Among them are Panov, Yevgeny Alexandrovich and Zachtey, Andrey Romanovich.
"They all confess", the report said.
Earlier, a Zaporozhye resident, Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terror attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt during an interrogation.
The FAS is going to fine Google for 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, the agency's website says.
"The fine for Google for violating the anti-monopoly legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine in the near future", - said the Deputy Head of the FAS Alexei Docenko.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies the manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia with the Google Play app store only on condition that the device will be installed other corporate applications.
Among these applications is the search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates part 1 of article 10 of the Federal Law "On the protection of competition" (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the execution of the order will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law "On Competition Protection" must be observed by all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations", - said the head of the Department of regulation of communications and information technologies of the FAS of Russia, Elena Zaeva.
The bureau suspects 16 Russian stores in collusion.
New Books was fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide".
The New Bookstore chain has been fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide", Moscow news agency reports.
The Rospotrebnadzor reported that without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book could be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
The Ostanka District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor.
A source at New Books confirmed that it was a Stace Kramer work.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were checking for the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow, the evening of the memory of Ernst the Unknown will be held.
In Moscow, the sculptor Ernst Unknown will be remembered, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Literature.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember him on their native land", - said the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It said it was important to the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
The evening is invited close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Yevgeny Yevtuchenko, the artist Boris Messserer, the president of the Pushkin-named GMI Irina Antonova, the director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kiбовsky, the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Unknown plan to hold a funeral for the sculptor in New York, presumably until August 14.
The end consumer of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Single middle-aged men like vinyl.
And while you've not rushed to smear the comments section with gross insults under the alias Not All Single Men Middle-Age, that claim is based on factual evidence.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is not due to the boom among millennials who want to penetrate new material, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It 's also not just the act of collecting by amateurs - it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results accurate?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the busy Soho street in a modest gray suit and make a big gesture before a stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Well, let's see".
All right, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt  hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores now fill the buildings once occupied by independent vendors  a few music stores with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm in close proximity to different people in some of these stores and I'm trying to assess their age and emotional state of mind through observation.
Glasgow-born Stuart, 55, whom I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and walks around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask you?
"I suppose so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, pictured above (he e-mailed me pictures, I didn't follow him home), run lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for purchasing such a large number of albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records he could not afford when they first came out, and buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I buy is late '60s, early '70s stuff, stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12, stuff that I was probably too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my flaw.
Wes, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are YouGov profiles.
He did, however, notice a new wave of people, influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt obliged to buy back their old records.
From the conversations I've had, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records", he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional significance of the records?
It takes a few seconds to go to a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community for like-minded people.
According to Waze, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and prefer to retreat into the permanence of familiar record envelopes, objects that evoke memories of a troubled youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling in the void or having material things as a kind of comfort", says Wes.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's an easy way to keep your head.
"We're like their social workers!" a colleague from the record shelf said.
An ICM poll in April showed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month had not heard it.
The survey also found that 41 percent of those who bought vinyl had a player they never used, while 7 percent of those who bought vinyl had no record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously confused, leafing through a shelf of Bosanov's collections.
The "trophy" aspect of the renaissance is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, observed.
"Someone came in the other day and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of the ingredients, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
They're younger people, not older, in their early 20s, just getting to know it.
Fopp, who's now dedicated almost the entire floor to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above stores  the latest synth and sexy Wild Beast pop, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns  it's nice to see the diversity in your customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the excruciating psychological trauma is hard to pin down by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked through Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending the money.
She doesn't make much money, she says, so collecting records isn't a good idea.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is"... she plunges into dreams with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My last stop was a store that is said to have helped to create a new generation of vinyl lovers: the Urban Fashionists.
While I'm creating the illusion of looking at jeans with their shorts on, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley recorder.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is lined with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one looks  maybe because they are just ornaments, some are placed so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real art vinyl.
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for a while longer, there's hardly anything to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the one that spends the most money on luxury items like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's findings are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don't rule out the existence of a huge number of female vinyl collectors and lovers who exist in the real world, in record stores and on online forums.
These people are probably working all the time in school or in the office.
But they clearly don't spend Thursday mornings walking through Berwick Street record stores, flipping through records and avoiding the gaze of the nasty 30-year-old fake host who hovers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark  longest living vertebrate animal  video report
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says that a female, between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long, set the record
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected Calais's bid to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or the simplest dishes for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais has said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the people running the 72 brick-and-mortar stores, but said the problems of Calais Prefecture "were fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the spaces provided a peaceful meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Children's Cafe at the camp, which is a non-profit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and shelter counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 - the highest ever - after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Microround libraries are inviting young freedmen to educational programs.

Britain stops at silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's master class lets them take the gold
Great Britain's impressive Rugby 7 series was crushed by a final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in ball possession, unraveling, dodging, supporting the game, running the lines and brute force to win gold  their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of Britain's third silver in a day and they could boast of their efforts in the first ever Rugby 7 Olympic tournament, which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The Boks' painful 7-5 semi-final defeat earlier in the day could return to hurt them in the final.
But despite everything, Fiji in this form beat the best possible 15-man team.
It may be some consolation for Britain, but it's probably not that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England's head coach at Wimbledon.
It was a bit of a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji got off to a great start, just for fun, beating the British attempt to catch the ball.
It was like running into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0, when O.C. Collinsaw went into the corner.
With four minutes to go, Gerryr Tuvay added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant interception attempt kept mountain man Leon Nakarava from scoring the third, but it only held Fiji back.
In the seventh minute, Jassa Veremaluà scored a touchdown in the right corner, and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and the clock was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravowo then broke through through several more sluggish attempts to intercept Great Britain and stormed the line to score a point.
The implementation led to a 29-0 in the break.
It looked as if Fiji was born to play rugby sevens, while Britain was still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much true.
Great Britain were making massive substitutions at half-time, and they clogged the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton caught the try for Great Britain by scoring a touchdown in the left corner to make it 36-7, but the game had long been on the path of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
Fiji's approach was a joy to behold.
Mother William decorated a Fijian cake that didn't need decorating, another last-minute attempt.
The whistle was blown, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on the grass, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-final, and Great Britain narrowly outran South Africa in a tense semi-final by one try each.
Kyle Brown leads the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton with some great legwork broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last-ditch attempt by Marcus Watson, brother of the 15-man England team, Anthony, secured the victory and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by a coach's fight with cancer
There's no more exciting gold at these games, and that's saying something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy ascents in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added meaning of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there as they sought their second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such heights.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated season, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of a swan, does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold, there was a battalion of ready hands contributing to the incremental victories that matter, and no hands that played a more important role than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your vision for the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio is lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the time gap to a minimum, if that can be a correct expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get better fast.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said it was quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after the win, their first thoughts were of Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual, trying to get over his own feelings.
Stanning, a captain in the artillery regiment who served in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe a little bit overwhelming, but it means so much".
It just goes to show how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin has.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This couple sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams started to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were in a phase.
Helen was like, 'Stay in the process, stay in the process.'
It's important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't trying to do anything awesome.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just hoping we could row well and go out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover is supposed to be at her own wedding next month with TV adventurer Steve Bakshol.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so nervous.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better", she said.
The government extended the deadline for destroying sanctioned products
The government has extended the deadline for destroying foodstuffs banned from Russia until the end of 2017.
The relevant resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it was published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
The ban has been extended several times since then, and now it is in effect until December 31, 2017.
Some types of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs are banned from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
The Hunt for the Forbidden
Moscow is expected to experience heavy rain and thunderstorms on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, bringing rainfall and lowering air temperatures.
The air is heating up to 25 degrees Celsius during the day.
So, on Saturday night in Moscow, a short rain will pass, possible thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 15 m/s.
Rain is expected in the afternoon with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m/s.
Thunderstorms are also forecast in the Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
Rain is unlikely next week.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates are higher than the commitments Russia made when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation", the organization's official website said.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "of an all-encompassing nature".
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions, which has introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the US's behaviour in resolving disputes at the WTO undermines the organization's accepted principles of debate.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the US refusal to confirm South Korean judge Chan Son-hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now has 162 member countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
The President 's Administration has changed its head .
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Anton Vaino, former deputy of Sergei Ivanov, as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has made changes to the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vino said during the meeting that he considers important the anti-corruption work that he began to carry out as head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head who led the work in the presidential administration for a long time, effectively built the activities of the AP, has left.
He was replaced by Anton Vayno, the deputy head of the administration, a man who knows the specifics of the job.
In Poland, they're assuming they won't buy gas from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years, gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish company in finance, Boguslav Mažec.
His words are being reported by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply areas for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway", Majec said.
Currently, Gazprom holds a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas in the first half of 2016, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The Russian gas giant's share of purchases rose to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, the Polish anti-monopoly agency did not agree to the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners to build the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland had left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas through Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the power of the Nord Stream-2 will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its installation.
In late May, it was reported that Gazprom was not planning to take any action in connection with the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term contracts for gas supplies from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of the company's board.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased their gas purchases from Russia by 42%.
The deputy of Gazprom added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG has submitted a request to the Stockholm arbitration court does not mean that the negotiations have ended.
Earlier, the Polish company had appealed to the court to get the purchase price for Russian gas lowered.
Recall that the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, said that the Polish authorities decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for gas supply.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
"Northern Stream-2" envisages the construction of two strands of a sea gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany through the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area", he said, responding to a corresponding question from journalists, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers were monitoring the situation at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at the Ufa airport has appeared on the Internet, which rolled out of the runway by 400 meters and crashed into the left wing.
The video was published by the 360 TV channel.
The accident happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The KrasAvia flight came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to safety, no injuries.
The airship itself was transported to the parking lot.
The airport of Ufa is operating in the normal mode.
The Volga Investigative Department of the Russian Transportation Agency has been investigating the cause of the plane's hard landing.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides in the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN Special Envoy for Syria Stephane de Mistura believes the incident was undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation into reports of chemical weapons use in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, came out on August 2.
The opposition then claimed that the Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down and that the air force had dropped bombs containing a poisonous substance, but Moscow called the accusations a hoax.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry blamed the incident on the opposition group "Harakyat Nur ad-Din az-Zinki".
It soon became known that there were two toxic gas-laden bombs.
One of the victims confirmed this to the BBC.
"A few minutes later I smelled gas, my eyes started to burn, it was hard to breathe", the newspaper quoted a witness as saying.
At least seven people were killed in the attack, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened".
The prohibition of chlorine use in warfare is enshrined in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all sides in the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition".
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that its neighborhoods are shelled daily, and terrorists are preventing residents from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in military operations.
The organization says the three-hour daily curfew is "not enough to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped".
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egellan, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed to bring aid to the city and evacuate the sick and wounded each week.
"We have to send bulk cargoes from the truck column to areas where the roads are practically destroyed and the remaining ones are mined", Mr. Egellan said. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its willingness to sit down with us at the negotiating table".
Consultations in Geneva between U.S. and Russian officials on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are ongoing.
How Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the midst of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, Russia announced on August 11 that it would impose a three-hour ceasefire, which would be in effect daily from Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essential items to the city.
The decision of the Russian Defense Ministry was made against the background of the growing international pressure on Moscow to call off the military operation and help restart the negotiation process.
A series of explosions at a Thai resort have killed four people.
Several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 injured.
The epicenter of the blasts was Huá Hín.
Among the victims were 10 foreigners, citizens of four states, no Russians among them.
No terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the incident, but the Interior Ministry has quickly said that Islamists were not involved.
Several people have been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary reports from local police, the scale and nature of the explosions suggest that they were directed against the country's military leadership.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Tani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012 year) to 2.8% (2015 year), but tourism remained one of the few industries to show development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharyen said.
It's too early to say what the targets are, he added, but the country's interior ministry "is confident they are not linked to international extremist groups".
"It's too early to draw any conclusions", said Mr. Patanacharya.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local subversions, and we are trying to identify the people behind them.
The blasts occurred on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithischaip Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a half-hour difference.
They were hidden in trees in busy streets filled with dining tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German nationals, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the blasts, the press service of the Russian tourism ministry reported.
Local experts also link the blasts to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution-making commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters needed to decide whether they supported a system whereby the upper house of parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, Thailand was rocked by a military coup led by army commander Prayut Chan-och.
The army, he said, was moved to this step by the continuing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed curfew and censorship, and dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok came to be in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred near the Victory Monument in central Bangkok, where one of the main protests was held, injuring 28 people, five of them critically.
The blasts were made by unknown motorcyclists.
Authorities have stepped up security in the capital and mobilized military forces to protect the protesters.
The conditions were being worked out in the Dry Log.
As it became known to "Ъ", the government was offered to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the gold ore deposit of Sukhay Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed that companies with 25% or more foreign ownership and those bidders whose capital does not have at least 25% state participation are not allowed to participate in the auction.
Industry participants are not expecting the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not willing to take the risk of a complex and expensive project.
They can announce the auction in August, and hold it in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government the draft terms and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, the Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told "Ъ".
The draft was filed Wednesday night, one of them said.
The Ministry of Environment confirmed to "Ъ" that the project was submitted to the government.
A representative of the vice-premier's underground ministry, Alexander Khloponin, told "Ъ" that the project had not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the government's order, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held in October", - say in the Ministry of Nature.
According to "Ъ", the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, as outlined in the version that was sent to the ministries and the FIDFs for approval in July (it is with "Ъ").
The first is the presence of at least 25% of the state participation in the capital of the applicants.
The second is the denial of auction access to companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the FZ-57's understanding of foreign investment in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law, as "Ъ" wrote on August 2, the auction may not allow companies whose beneficiaries (25% shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log is a federal-value subsoil (the reserves are over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Environment confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on details until the government order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the participants of the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, the "Ъ" said in December 2015 in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroschenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with "Rostec".
The interlocutors of Kommersant do not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners.
"But it's in the spirit of the times: not to give up control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the backdrop of Western sanctions", - argues the interlocutor of "Ъ", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donsky, stated that foreigners "can go to the consortium", if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The people who interviewed Kommersant think it's unlikely that the government will adjust conditions.
The main contender for the Dry Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold producer of the Russian Federation PJSC "Polaris", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rostec".
In July, the partners created the joint venture "SL Zoloto", where "Polu" has a 51% share, and the structure of "Rostec" of the Republic of Tatarstan-Greece - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Pole told Kommersant that it was "certainly interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competencies and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the conditions are announced", the Polus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the Russian government, sources told "Ъ".
The possibility of participation in the development of the Dry Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "Ъ", are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of gold producers of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, estimated the investment of "Ъ" in Sukhaya Log in $2,5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are intimidated not only by the amount of investment, but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of reserves and technology of working with complex ores are needed, "Kommersant" interlocutors in the industry explain.
The largest M&A deal was launched on the pension market - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of uniting four NPFs under its control.
As a result, the National Pension Fund will be created on the basis of the "Gazfund Pension Savings" with a volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
The launch of the procedure of merging four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofund", "Natural Heritage" and "Gazfund Pension Savings" - was announced yesterday by the owner of 100% of the funds of the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" LLC.
"Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of not worsening the conditions of the existing contracts", the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of the "Pension Savings Fund".
As noted by the general director of this NPF Oleg Białoszycki, the association of funds allows to solve several problems: expanding the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, reproducing the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate management.
According to him, the estimated completion date of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, the Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
According to data as of March 31, the combined pension funds' pension savings exceeded 373 billion rubles.
According to the report on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled LLC owns 65%) and the NPF "Gazfund" (35%).
However, the group launched the merger much later than its competitors.
So, the group controlled by O1 NPF "Future" was absorbed by "Stalfund" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the foundations "Uralsib" and "Russian Standard".
"The unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems", - notes the general director of the NPF "Future" Nikolai Sidorov.
Since April, the consolidation of funds has been actively working in the "Safmar" pension group - the European, Education and Science and Regional funds should merge into the "Safmar" pension fund before the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the Trust National Investment Fund.
"The merger of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses", the Safmar pension group said.
The pause in the fund's merger, which was sustained by the KIT Financial Pension Administrator, could be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, the NPFs could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds issued by the group.
After amendments to the Central Bank's resolution in March this year, a number of issuers complying with the regulator's requirements no longer have such restrictions.
If necessary, one major player can buy the entire issue", says Yuri Nogin, director of the rating group of financial institutions of the AKRA.
Several top 15 NPF executives cited splitting of spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund, which the owners of the group had to agree on, as another possible reason for the pause.
Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment yesterday.
The Gazfond has not responded to the request of Kommersant.
While fund consolidation is a time-consuming and inexpensive endeavor, it will be justified in the long run.
According to the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okoleznov, "Gazfond Pensionne Zboroviny" has fewer outflows, the merger will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of the NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofund" in building retail sales of the PPP, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The Central Bank's demands on NPF processes and personnel are constantly growing, so it is not feasible to duplicate infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy, says Managing Director for Corporate Ratings of "Expert RA" Pavel Mitrofanov.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will definitely cover the possible costs of the merger", Mr. Mitrofanov notes.
The cost of uniting the four funds is estimated by Sergei Okolensov at 30-50 million rubles.
"The costs of maintaining four such funds amount to about 400 million rubles per year, and if consolidated, the budget will be cut in half in the medium term", Mr. Okoleznov said.
The Russian cinema has released the best Disney movie "Pit and his dragon".
Beautiful New Zealand scenery, a delightful dragon, heart-pounding stories and country-style songs are enough to make you believe in old-fashioned magic again, says ELENA KRAWZUN.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a tender nanny and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot after the puppy from the storybook, plays catch-up with him, and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, he's grown up and wearing a hip bandage, and you can't tell him from another woodsman, Mowgli.
This is how Pete is discovered by red-haired female warrior Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin's (Carl Urban), her husband's brother,'s brigade aggressively fells the forest.
Now she'll have to not only believe in the dragon, but help save him.
Pete is taking an accelerated course in "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code in their hearts and smile more dazzlingly than any commercial.
No character looks or acts so terrible that the viewer really starts to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who has opened up his hunt for the unusual inhabitant of his forest, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge, furry dragon turned out to be no threat, with a good-looking bulldog, a plane-like wing span, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, it snores, it purrs, it even snores, and fortunately it doesn't speak, but it's always wanted to be caressed, which makes it different from all the other famous movie dragons.
Elliot's visual image and manner of holding provides such a high degree of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, not only young viewers but adults too begin to cry desperately.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley as Pete, torn between a potential family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford is a masterful canonical grandfather that literally every child would love to have.
How did director David Lowery manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film "Dragon Pete", mediocre from nose to tail and remembered only for its mix of animation and gameplay, into the most soulful film of the summer?
It was a miracle.
In his painting, Lowry took only two things from the original: Pete's orphan and the dragon.
There's a lot of music and a lot of weird jokes.
This good tale takes a line from Bambi, Alien, and many other heartwarming children's pictures.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand its gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" isn't as stunningly beautiful as the original "Jungle Book", and it doesn't have the sleek villain that Kate Blanchett turned out to be in her new "Cinderella" as stepmother.
But this naive film is just as successful in helping us believe in miracles and goodness in the best of Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's Magic Castle are on the way to director Lowry's next film adaptation of Peter Pan.
The "Pete and His Dragon" tandem David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks have entered into a new ambitious project about a boy who is not growing up, based on the James Barry fairy tale of the same name.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov is facing a new charge
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor's office found flaws in the case of their defendant.
The fact that the D.A. made that statement, we learned from investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to attend a court session on the issue of limiting access to criminal case materials, but the meeting did not take place, and investigators informed us about the representation made by the prosecutor's office", - quotes RBC lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said the prosecutor's office pointed out to investigators that the case and the materials collected were not appropriate.
Now the investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and bring Alexander Sokolov a new charge.
Either a different article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
According to Kommersant, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation had removed the accusation of the RBC journalist of "squatting the political situation towards instability" and "overthrowing the government by illegal means".
"Kommersant" correspondent ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympic athlete in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian national team, had lunch in the local cafeteria and even passed the WADA test after that.
Life doesn't seem to stop here for a second.
Even at night.
The final races sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
Moreover, there is a constant process of settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and others, on the contrary, just arrive here.
And at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are drawn into one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings we usually discuss some urgent household issues, - says Igor Kazikov, head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team. - Despite the fact that the house in which we are located is an example - it was commissioned one of the first and demonstrated to all inspectors, even in it there are some imperfections.
The hot water problem, the toilet problem.
We've been fighting for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, nobody came to clean.
Then the cleaners started coming, but they just sprayed the floor with something, and that was it.
The floors they have, you see, are kind of innovative.
They say you can't wash them humanely.
We know these floors are plain laminate!
So, we've got the cleaning company changed, and now it's OK.
The Olympic Village is a sleepy area, surrounded on one side by mountains, on the other by an impressive moat, with places filled with water.
For safety, there is a two-meter-high iron fence along the perimeter, along which machine guns are used.
The village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments, located in 31 houses.
One of the 18-story buildings has a huge Russian flag hanging on it - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our national team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems are probably the most pressing for the national team.
There are two ads on the registration counter: the printed "Please do not throw paper in the toilet!" and the handwritten "I accept badges as a gift.
The rack itself is drowning in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of brochures: "Memorandum on Infectious Diseases for Travelers to Rio de Janeiro", "First Aid for Drowning, Strange Bodies in the Airways, Loss of Consciousness - Stages of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation", "First Aid for Burns, Heat Stroke, Fractures and Bleeding".
The text inside is pretty encouraging.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not all will be happy.
Of course, the Russian national team has a medical center, which is ready to provide qualified assistance, including relaxation and sports massage, to the residents of the house at any time.
The headquarters of our delegation is right across the street from the medical center.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!"
And of course, the lyrics:
All the arguments are complete nonsense!
Only those who fear Allah will believe in it.
The less we are, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And to further lift the spirits, the announcement hangs: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by the protoierry Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeyev.
You can order a prayer and other trebles by phone...
In general, there is a meditation and religious rites center for representatives of all confessions.
Well, the Russians are in a privileged position, they have their own chapel.
Because of the busy elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs that are recommended for use during a fire.
And in the dark, he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I think, ready to go to the innovative floor cleaning at any moment, they decided to have a quiet time right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I met an old friend, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batutists, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his student, European champion Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about, - shares impressions the honored coach of Russia. - We live in two, the beds, of course, almost in the closet, but this is uncritical.
The nozzle is one on four, but it's spacious.
The closet, of course, is funny, made of cloth, not very trustworthy, but you can put things in.
"No, you're pretending, they're out of tea!" shakes the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one because it is a space of 2,7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
They're giving away over 60,000 servings a day, absolutely free.
The menu options are "Best of Brazil", "World cuisine", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I've seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And I haven't found any soup in any of the departments of the giant restaurant.
What soup? - Kuznetsova is surprised. - There is no tea!
Good thing I brought some Chinese, boiled.
And the teapot.
But just so you know, we have worse food on the courts.
There's something to choose from, despite the intolerable monotony.
I personally chose the steamed cod and the fried chicken in tomato sauce.
A plate with the name of the food in English, French, and Portuguese is placed next to each dish, indicating the food's nutritional value and the presence of allergens.
Well, it was quite edible, to be honest.
I don't know why there's a line at the local McDonald's.
The well-fed, relaxed, "warm" athletes are waiting for our best friends at the restaurant - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're a clever trick, a quiz where the winner gets a T-shirt.
Provocative, you might say!
To get the gift, you have to answer at least eight of the ten questions correctly.
I have questions in Russian! - the girl from WADA attacked me.
But you didn't attack him.
I mean, I'm patriotically inclined, naturally.
The situation is exacerbated by the second question: "If I receive a notification of a doping check, should I go to a doping checkpoint immediately?"
I'm stuck with option B: "No, I have one hour".
I lost my temper, so to speak.
I forgot you don't have to wait for WADA to ease you.
So, we need to get there right away.
Well, in the seventh round of the quiz, I was in a pretty critical position.
I thought, if I'm having trouble keeping a balanced diet because of my busy schedule, which I am, by the way, having trouble doing, then I can use bio-supplements to get "extra nutrients to boost my performance".
No, they won't let you!
More precisely, the answer is worded in such a way that it does not prohibit categorically, but insistently, in several sentences.
It's not fair, WADA!
"How are things, Russia?" the quiz host asks.
There's nowhere to go, behind Yefimov, Isinbayev and our whole bloodless team.
So I focused and I won the unlucky T-shirt.
You know what they say, ours!
I went to the gym next door in a victorious mood.
I'm just busy counting the simulators.
I'm down to 250.
He noted with surprise that there was not a single Russian athlete in this accumulation of running tracks.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let those who cannot play, practise!
And in the clinic next door, there was a guy.
It's time for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
The clinic, however, like the whole village, has a condom machine hanging everywhere.
It has the heartwarming message: "Celebrate with a condom!"
All you have to do is twist the iron, which looks like a door lock handle, and the condom, made from natural Amazon latex, is ready to fall out of the machine.
I got one for myself, as a souvenir.
The athletes will not be short of them - they have brought 450 thousand .
There is a whole entertainment center in the Olympic Village just for the festive and leisure time.
There's a sign next to it, just in case, reminding you that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some weird video-trainer-like devices.
What is this? - I'm asking a comrade in Ukrainian national team uniform who actively uses a freaky toy.
He could, of course, just say he doesn't want to talk to a man in a Russian national team uniform, and that's it.
Here, by the way, some strange coincidence in the eyes of the guys in yellow and blue.
The most successful team, it turns out.
To go around the village, to look at every corner, takes at least three hours.
But if you walk instead of ride electric cars, you'll have a Canadian team house with moose in the front and a tent with a repair bathroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry room, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a grocery store, and a mailroom with a unique brand (only you can't wait for the Chinese philatelists to line up), and a bank, and a finds office, and a photo booth.
And late at night, you'll be sitting, exhausted, by an olive tree, hanging with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the deceased athletes.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that's splashing out a bug-killing liquid, thinking about eternity.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village never stops for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched as the Australians nearly punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: I was the first to hear that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the rap at the XXXI Olympic Games.
I may even be the only Muscovite who saw it happen - not counting, of course, those who watched the competition in Carioca that night.
Only a true fan can understand that.
Imagine this: the night of Moscow.
The neighbors downstairs - as usual at one o'clock at night - wake up and start yelling at each other, very loudly, but without any malice.
And threatening to move furniture.
The kitchen is running out of tap water, so I don't have time to go to the market and buy a new one, as the plumber asked.
The TV schedule is not clear, so I just kept the control of the channels "Match", "First" and just in case "Russia" - although it is almost pointless.
Russia is the home of repetition, all the sports there are recorded for some reason.
They're broadcasting live shows.
Hope, of course, for "Match" - all evening the young man shouted in news releases first about the great semi-final of Deriglazov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show it.
But instead, basketball is USA-Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were tied, won the first half at all.
They've replaced them with Americans who were stunned by their own greatness.
The result was a loss, but as they say now, the Olympic basketball tournament will never be the same.
That's all good, but there's a fight with Di Francesca coming up, and there's no change on the screen.
I'm starting to look through the channels in a slight panic.
It feels like the second time in a row.
All right, let's go in there, on the cable.
There's no fencing at any of the themed "Matches".
Oh, my feeling is that the fight is about to begin.
I'm not comfortable with the text and tweets of some sports sites.
The surfing convulsions give an unexpected but brilliant result.
The website of the "First", it turns out, is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that are taking place at this moment in time.
I click on the fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazova is a great counterattacker, he's going forwards on points - and he's obviously starting to drag time.
The Italian is almost the whole time.
We're one point ahead, just over two seconds to go.
Di Francesca throws herself at Deriglazova, she backs off, time runs out, the Italian woman gives the shot.
The win!
In a few seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone is announcing the fourth gold medal.
Turns out I'm the first one to see it.
The crazy, the loyal, the involved.
The Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Tatarstan (DUM) refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma obliged its imams to hold Friday sermons only in Tatar, to force young Tatars to "learn their native language".
The administration says that this "in no way infringes" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques in Kazan, people complain that up to 60% of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves, do not understand the Tatar language.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience".
Yesterday, the plenum of the Tatarstan Muslim Council unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language".
"For those who say that it is "difficult", we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language in every large mosque absolutely free of charge", - Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques the sermons "must be in the Tatar language".
He recalled that the Tatarstan Duma publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who does not speak Tatar well enough "can prepare thoroughly for them".
The Tatarstan Muslim Council unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, in the districts, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques used mostly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, the Zakkaban and the "Eniler".
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed that the government is setting the task for all students to master both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any violation of non-Tatar Muslims", Mr. Muhammadshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a mandatory, basic part of the prayer".
At the same time, the prayers themselves will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will continue in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafiq Mukhametshin told "Ъ" that there was no serious threat of the displacement of the Tatar language from the mosques.
Other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in sermons in the republic, he said.
The decision of the Duma was actively supported by the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC).
The head of the VKT executive committee, Rinat Zakirov, told "Kommersant": "Mosques are an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language were to leave this sphere.
He noted that only preaching in the Tatar language was "the wish of the imams themselves", but the WCT executive committee "considers it correct".
The imams who preached in Russian are ready to implement the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
They'll be upset, of course.
"We will have to rebuild", says the Imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mawleddinov.
According to him, sermons in Russian are even closer to many Tatars, since "the Russian language is everywhere, in schools, in kindergartens, on the radio".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show the way out of this situation", he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
They are Uzbeks, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
We have a lot of foreign students, Africans, Arabs.
"So we switched to Russian four years ago", says the imam.
He believes that in Tatar, the sermons will "reach a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience".
But we will comply with the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For me, for example, it will be easier because the Tatar language is my native language", concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
Former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was brought to trial
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has approved the indictment of the Russian Federal Security Service in a criminal case investigated by the Russian Federal Security Service.
Ex-head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rubles in damages to the Federal Penitentiary, will be brought to trial.
The capital prosecutor's office sent a criminal case against the former director of the Federal Sentencing Service of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unit "Center of information-technical support and communication of the Federal Service for the Execution of Penalties" (FDUT CITOS) Victor Odetelenow to the Zamoskvorecsky District Court.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the Moscow State Security Service of the SCR under part 3 of article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, which led to serious consequences), part 4 of article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using their official position, in the composition of an organized group, in a particularly large size).
In addition, Krivolopov is accused under part 1 of article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these individuals fraudulently stole from the state treasury the budget funds allocated by the FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems for the controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal the budget money, the group's participants developed a scheme according to which the enterprise under their control, the CITOS State Unit, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices several times higher.
Despite the fact that the Federal State Unit of the Central Statistical Office had no production equipment, buildings, facilities for placing production capacities, allowing to create a finished cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between it and the Federal Statistical Service of Russia were concluded five state contracts for the sum of more than 3,3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, the accounts of the Samara branch of the Federal State University of Pest amounted to more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, Mr. Reimer received more than 140 million rubles in cash in his office from one of the accomplices, against whom the criminal case has been assigned to a separate investigation.
Nikolay Krivolopov, who was involved in the machinations, was found to have an unknown origin of the reward pistol, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
According to the case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim against the accused for compensation of material damage in the amount of 2,7 billion rubles.
Soccer player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for former football player and then parliament member Hakan Şukur and searched two of his family's homes.
Turkish football star of the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Şukur is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with an attempted coup last month.
The forward, who ended his playing career in 2008, is accused of being a member of an "armed terrorist group".
The movement is "Hizmet", a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gülen.
It is his president Erdogan who is the organizer of the coup attempt on July 15.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for Hakan Shukur's arrest was issued today, and police have already searched two homes belonging to the former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gülen's organization included his father, besides Hasan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur represented several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he never played more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Şukur is still the most productive striker of the Turkish national team: in his assets 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his post as a deputy due to the corruption investigation that began around Erdogan's party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, on July 25 at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey.
They are accused of facilitating the military coup and of having ties to the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media workers could face lengthy prison terms ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for foreign films", he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are hard to compete for the audience with big Hollywood films.
We have over 100 paintings made in our country every year, and 20-25 films are on display.
"Even they have a hard time competing with the huge budgets of Transformers and Iron Man", the filmmaker said.
Recall that on July 1 in Crimea began work the All-Russian youth educational forum "Tavrida".
Among the participants - teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian directions from all over Russia and a number of countries of the near and far abroad.

The new general contractor promises to hand over the Zenit Arena by December 26.
The new general contractor of the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, which is to host the matches of the 2017 Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup, the "Metrostray" company promises to hand over the arena by December 26, reports "RIA Novosti" with reference to the head of the provisional commission of the Federation Council for preparation for the 2018 World Cup in football Vadim Tyalpanov.
"Today, together with the Minister of Sports of Russia Vitaly Mutko, we visited the construction site, with us was the General Director of "Metrostraya" Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd have the stadium ready by December 26.
It's a serious St. Petersburg company, it never breaks the deadline.
Vitaly Mutko and I were satisfied with what we saw and heard", the agency quoted the interlocutor.
Vitaly Mutko had earlier arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tyalpanov also noted that the Federation Council commission he heads will continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and will regularly visit the construction site.
Recall, yesterday it became known that the company "Metrostray" will complete the construction of "Zenit-Arena", the cost of the contract will be about 5,4 billion rubles. The same company won the bid for the landscaping of the territory around the stadium, the cost of the contract - 2,4 billion rubles. The contracts with the JSC "Corporation "Transstray", the LLC "Injiniering Corporation "Transstray-SPb"" and the JSC "Injiniering Corporation "Transstray"" were terminated.
Two more companies were not allowed to compete for the stadium.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region) the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolay Sandakov, Konstantin Akulic, was detained.
According to "Ъ-Южный Урал" another defendant's lawyer, Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulich was summoned to the investigation department of the Miass Criminal Court to face charges in a year-old case of beatings.
Then Konstantin Akulic went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of the participants.
"Initially it was raised against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to protect Nikolay Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulic", - says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulic became the lawyer of the ex-deputy governor in early August.
Half an hour before the lawyer was called to the Miass Criminal Court, the defense was notified that the deadline for the trial of the case against Nikolay Sandakov expired on Monday.
We remind you, two criminal cases have been opened against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (the case of fraud) he is accused of promising for 1.5 million rubles to assist in the appointment of the head of the administration of Ozersk, Yevgeny Tarasov, as mayor of Magnitogorsk.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe allegedly received by Nikolai Sandakov from the director of the Piton PLC Igor Kalugin in the form of illegal gratuitous provision of services of a property nature in the amount of at least 1.3 million rubles.

The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has taken up the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh copper-melting plant.
The Karabakh copper-melting plant was founded by an English joint-stock company headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the livelihood of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998 it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh copper-melting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - the environmental one.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedy began to change in 2004, after the company was taken over by the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited "Karabashmed" in the first months of July.
The head of the South Urals called the changes that have occurred with the enterprise since "Karabashmed" went into the group of RMK.
The main event for the modernization of "Karabashmed" in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99,9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company, Vsevolod Levin, the investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of the "Karabashmed" ZAO is the reconstruction of the converter partition.
The replacement of three converters, sprayers, gas-carrying tract is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016 it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes to the budget of Karabakh will increase.
For the entire project implementation period of the Tomsk State-Owned Gas Plant - from the start of construction to the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the GOK is put into operation , the revenue from taxes to all levels of budgets could be 80.9 billion rubles .
During the year of production in Varna district, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the enterprise is successful, the more the amount of the allowances can be", added Valery Ulanovsky.
The Ministry of Finance clarified that in 2015 tax deductions from the Miheyevsk State-Owned Company approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of SMC enterprises in the life and development of the territories where they are present is not limited to tax deductions.
The enterprises of the RMK help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve the landscape.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was the renovation of the N9 kindergarten for 95 children.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of disrepair.
Also on the territory of the "RMK Arena" will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
The RMK Arena will allow for spectacular professional sports events of international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports activities in comfortable conditions accessible to the residents of Chelyabinsk, first of all for children.

"Military personnel of anti-submarine-diversion units have worked out anti-submarine-diversion defense of the base of the fleet forces on the coast and adjacent sea area of the Black Sea", - said Digalo.
The exercises involved about 400 military personnel, more than 10 units of military equipment, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, anti-diversion boats "Grachonok" and patrol fast-moving boats "Raptor".
During the maneuvers, the force of the brigade ships using hydraulic acoustic means detected the conditional diversion groups and repelled the attack of "submarine diversionists" from the sea on the base of the ChF forces.
The Ka-27 helicopter landed a landing party, which blocked and destroyed the diversionists of the hostile force.
After that, the Black Sea Fleet trawlers went out to look for mines.

A Moscow court arrested a father for killing his adopted daughter: Investigation and trial: Law enforcement: Lenta.ru
The Moscow region's Lake City Court has authorized the arrest of Roman Chernykov, who confessed to killing his six-year-old adopted daughter.
This was reported by the press secretary of the court Nina Zhilkina on Thursday, August 11, according to the city news agency "Moscow".
"The court granted the request of the investigating authorities to choose a two-month detention period for Chernikov", she said.
Chernikov will be in custody until October 9.
On August 11, the Moscow Regional Criminal Investigation Department reported that the adoptive parents and grandmother of a six-year-old girl had confessed to her murder.
In particular, Roman Chernikov reported that he committed the murder of a child one day in April 2016 from personal hostile relations, while at home in a state of alcohol intoxication.
Then, in order to hide the child's body, he burned it and scattered the remains along with his wife in a large square.
On the evening of August 9, at the interrogation of the investigator, the foster parents reported that in April 2016, a six-year-old child drowned in a bathtub.
For a long time they managed to hide the disappearance of the girl from everyone, but in August, when they learned that the guardianship authorities were soon to come to their home, they decided to tell everyone that the child was missing.

The pensioner turned the beach house into a "budget beach tower".
Netizens laughed at photos of an elderly man installing a beach trampoline and turning it into a trampoline for water jumping.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the "My Taganrog" group on the social network "VKontakte", which led many to believe that the photo was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In comments, the "innovation" was dubbed "a budget tower" and "a mobile trampoline".
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "smeak", and some noted that the man risks serious injury when jumping from his tower because he installed it at a shallow depth.
However, one commentator on the Pikabu portal noted that one cannot judge the depth of the sea by the picture.
"One, we don't know how deep it is, the beach can be overcrowded with a steep descent of one meter right behind the stairs, and two, even if it is one meter deep, with the right skill you can jump from a couple of meters", wrote a user nicknamed C0JIbAMDJZ.

This was reported on Friday, August 12, on the court's website.
Migul was found guilty of committing crimes under articles 286 ("Overstepping authority"), 285.1 ("Undesirable spending of budget funds") and 285 ("Abuse of official authority") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that the official in December 2008 gave his acquaintance a land plot in Mukhinka village, violating the procedure established by the land legislation.
In 2006, he illegally issued a decree to acquire the city's ownership of a high-cost road bridge across the Chigiri River without competitive procedures and the conclusion of a municipal contract, Interfax clarifies.
In addition, in the period from 2007 to 2010, Miguel changed the terms of payment under the purchase and sale agreement of the land lease agreement, which was provided for the construction of housing, in the interests of the commercial organization under his control, and also released the company from the rent payment.
As a result, the budget of the region received less than 5 million rubles, and the city treasury about 21 million rubles.
On August 4, it became known that the former mayor, who is in custody on suspicion of corruption and who was a candidate for the deputy mandate, did not provide the signature sheets for the elections to the State Duma in time and was removed from the election race.

Owners of messengers and postal services must identify users and remove banned information - that's the brief content of a bill developed by the Media and Communications Union (MCS), which unites Russia's largest communications operators (Vedomosti has it).
Employees of the three member companies confirmed that such a project is under discussion.
In early autumn, it should be presented to a working group led by first vice-premier Igor Shuvalov, said the interlocutor of "Vedomosti" in the ISS.
It's about amendments to the Communications and Media Act.
They provide that any "Internet service provider providing electronic messaging" is obliged to identify users on the basis of information contained in the databases of the telecommunications operators, having previously concluded contracts with them.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering sanctions against Russia for hacking into the Democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party's servers, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources.
According to reports, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to officially accuse Russia or Russian-backed hackers of attacking the servers in order to impose sanctions.
Sources say the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are pretty sure Russia was involved in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the US generally prefers not to name the people who carry out the hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the DPRK was officially blamed.
But last year, Obama issued an executive order that simplified the process of imposing sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally aimed at China, but it could be used against other countries as well.
The decision-making process can be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers were operating with Russian support, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They will have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it could exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the Barack Obama administration is allowing sanctions against the state whose hackers hacked into the servers of the Democratic National Committee.
WikiLeaks published an email from the Democratic National Committee.
Media reports suggested that hackers working with Russian authorities may have been involved in the hack.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the competition in the mobile app market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google gave smartphone manufacturers access to Android components on terms that prohibited pre-installation of apps from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install other applications along with the Google Play store.
Following the results of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said Deputy Head of the FAS Alexey Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the law on competition protection should be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, for its part, intends to first study the decision and only then decide on further action: to implement it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in breach of the competition law back in September last year and ordered the contracts to be adjusted by December 18.
But Google didn't give it their approval.
The company and the agency have been in litigation ever since.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they are discussing the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement with Google.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion was expressed by the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat's "Anime" effect is criticized as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that the filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it is racially uneducated.
With the Lens tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to alter reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, or a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are rough, curved-line tools that create over 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of promoting dark facial skin or encouraging whitened faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered this week a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist caricature of Asian "yellowheads".
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions pointed to a more serious problem in the company, which is diversity.
The news spread on Wednesday, and anger followed in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company commented that the lens was conceived as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for experts who know about racism from the inside, the lens reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others have completely rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was heavily shared, said the lens was "offensive and at least embarrassing".
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side-by-side comparison of a very crude cartoon on Asians and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow lipstick, but highly degrading yellow lipstick.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the gadgets we all carry around with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- may mean that they're more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday, "this kind of process is much harder to go unnoticed than it used to be".
On Thursday, Ju, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes racial tensions are the reason for the lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, herself a Chinese American, wrote: "Either they didn't have enough non-white people in the state to make those decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they don't have positions where they can speak out safely and openly".
Other reviewers share her view, expressing displeasure that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origin of its staff on Thursday, but according to a source, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and to actively try to engage internal resources.
For her part, Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say that it's not going to work".
Military leadership misrepresents ISIS intelligence, reports congressional committee
U.S. Central Command officials have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the evidence on the ground, a congressional commission said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by an operational team established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts who claimed that the leaders had misrepresented their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as the Center, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the Central Command's high command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism than was supported by actual data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies", the report's news release said.
"What happened at the Central Committee is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with a false analysis, our military suffers", said House of Representatives Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The problems with the leadership at the Central Committee are reaching the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the shortcomings that have been consistently identified in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of U.S. actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration's leadership ordered the falsification of the reports, it does state that analysts felt that the leadership of the Central Committee forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command to Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events", the report said.
For example, a Central Committee official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at retaking Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, we know for sure", said House Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officers of the U.S. Central Command falsified intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on ISIS was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more detailed data will follow the report released Thursday.
An additional, unfinished investigation of the Central Intelligence Agency's intelligence is being conducted by the Department of Defense's chief inspector.
The Democratic representatives on the House Intelligence Committee released their own data Thursday, which is consistent with some of the Republican task force's findings.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the Center created an overly closed-door procedure for conducting intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and Iraqi security forces", House of Representatives Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic Party's top representative on the committee, said in a statement.
This procedure, Schiff said, "has delayed the release of intelligence documents", has damaged the morale of analysts, and "does not adequately reflect differing views".
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to force the Centcom analysts to match their findings to "a biased or political interpretation".
The preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation were released Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, opened after complaints from the CIA's analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues".
The results of the investigation go beyond whether the American bombing of Iraq and Syria is achieving its goals (as more and more Defense Department officials are now claiming).
But last year's statements have made it questionable whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hot spots.
The criticism of the intelligence community on the Islamic State echoes the controversy that occurred more than a decade ago when CIA analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that the administration of President George Walker Bush, in response to the protests of many analysts, had backed a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic State intelligence protest.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes on Islamic State oil refineries did not significantly impair the terrorist group's financial position because it built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not spread outside of Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then commander of the Central Command, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after testimony in the Senate that many lawmakers found to be an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
USA wins 4 straight in women's field hockey, bringing them closer to a decisive match against Britain
Having once scored three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the scoring on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team as the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bamm says she's not sure she'd ever do something like this.
"I can't think", she said.
I'm not really the type of person to track my goals.
Here's what she knows: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they're competing for first place in their group with Britain, who remain undefeated after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and the Americans will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their six-team group and who will be second.
The winner will avoid a strong Dutch team, the leaders of the other group, a little while before the quarter-final games begin.
But Saturday's game shows the Americans here have made a splash with their surprise series, four years after they finished last out of 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a grass hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at age 16, becoming its youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to make the final team.
Then came 2012, when things didn't go well for her and her teammates.
The following year, Coyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical fitness", said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a throw from an uncomfortable short-handed pitcher.
India came into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative into his own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiralled into the middle and sent the ball sharply into the goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The win was the first on the tour for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now", Parnham said, "but how good it is depends on the result of Saturday's game".
In the midst of the Olympic Games ' unrest - the дзен jumps on the batute
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympics.
What's happening in Rio de Janeiro seems unchangeable and inevitable, a mad mix of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic flame itself is that burning torch that's passed from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or eavesdrop on your next-door neighbors in the coffee shop and not hear about Simone Biles or Kathy Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Kloe.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympian, the handsome guy with the cheek holes, could easily be among the celebrities being shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencing champion.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the Olympic gold in the pole vault.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reign.
But if I may speak in defense of my personal bias, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of the hops on the bat.
Although the long jump has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that it was an Olympic sport at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in the pole vault, and their athletes did not reach the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share men's awards, and Chinese and Canadians share women's awards.
Dun Dun from China and Rosey McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the bat-jumping has an outsider's charm, in part because to the uneducated ear, it's more associated with a circus college than the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm no expert here, just a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They really have comic potential -- it's a cartoonish twist on endless jumps -- but also the grace of gymnastics and water jumping, two sports that they basically combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", meaning "trampoline for jumping into the water".
The contestants jump on a giant batute, soaring almost 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic stunts (turns, bends, and jumps) before finally landing on their feet.
They are rated by performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
The medal contenders have to go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They're not just trying to get to the finish line or the starting line, but also, in front of the camera, to another annoying milestone: the world or Olympic record.
It's a noble, admirable, even fanatical, persistence that's enough to make even the viewer cry.
But it's a little tiring watching the Games, I think.
He's a breath of fresh air for the trampoline jumps.
The direction of the batutista is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
And they're not without competition or difficulty, of course, but there's no crazy rush to the finish, no long jumps throughout the program, just the amazing, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest thing to Zen to an Olympic sport.
The women's qualifying competition, followed by the final, will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; the men's competition will be held on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daytime schedule beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, there's a quiet, beautiful moment that can easily be overlooked in the general dump.
And if the only way to raise awareness is to expose male athletes to desirable views and objectification -- as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymnasts in the United States -- Dooley is just waiting for his new, enthusiastic crowd.
"Generation protesting" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of disintegration?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a staunch ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights activists say the government's response was brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Video footage from the protest sites, believed to have been taken late last year or early this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks as they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations' top human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult", said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the international crisis research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no other country in Africa receives this kind of support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably  there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are generally quiet, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia has hardly been a model of democracy  human rights organizations constantly mention government repression - opposition on the state's territory was crushed, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven into remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly repressed and left with no other option but to protest, there will be a revolt", said Seyyum Teshomé, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, with fighting over the unclear, disputed border claiming hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less wiped out in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the unrest to rearm themselves.
There are a number of factors that explain why bitter feelings that have been boiling in the depths of the soul for years now flare up.
The first, which seems completely harmless, is smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have more Ethiopians been able to connect on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and internet services have improved.
Even when the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find ways to communicate through proxy servers that hide their location.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromo and the Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhara from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We will act together under one principle", said Mulatu Gemetsu, the Oromo leader.
The largest protests were held in Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military and intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third cause of concern is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see danger.
Analysts claim that he was especially adept at recognizing the first signals of discontent and used scouts to gather data and neutralize opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Haile Mariam Desalien, emerged from nowhere and took over from Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailema'riam is from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tiger.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was apparently an election that the government rigged and then rigged.
During the subsequent repressions, many Protestants were killed, though in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts commended Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure development, such as a new intercity train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously that hasn't stopped growing internal discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it's taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a town in Amhara, attacked Tiger-owned businesses, and anti-Tiger hate on social media is becoming pervasive.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it was shutting down the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose its power in an already unstable region.
"And this stretched rope will be hard to get through", said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the latest conflict that engulfed his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to address the American people intelligently.
It also put his deputies, who had tried to protect him during the turmoil, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements he probably did not mean.
Making the suggestion at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump insisted on his claim on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really meant that the president and Clinton had founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump said he was just driving.
This post was the exact opposite of the claim made just a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his tone by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a falling rating.
Trump and Clinton gave competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
Trump tried to return to the topic on Friday.
He took to Twitter again, warning that Clinton's plans would lead to higher taxes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism for practically voicing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's email, he later explained his comments by saying, "Of course I'm joking".
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing messages that are getting a response from his fans, watching how they act, and then explaining them one way or another, depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says and knows that it's vague enough to interpret it differently.
Instead of softening his tone for the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more bitter tone in recent days as his ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and closing in on her in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the focus of increased attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, his jokes have put his staunch allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump's most prominent vice presidents, made a serious effort to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment", Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that ISIS was a little, little, little organization that was almost unknown before Obama, and he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened, because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, with Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to flourish because it failed to crack down on the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania rally on Friday, Trump continued to tweet about the media's dismissive and biased attitude toward him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" TV experts who were trying to figure him out, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump's defense as further proof that he is unfit to be president.
Once-displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verbe was a cash-only, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of her window on Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri, which replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the rebuilding city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is torn down and The Werb is now a soap shop".
But while New York is constantly changing, it is also constantly being updated.
The rebuilt Verbe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but it's still got some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Plus, the coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started at Verbe in 2001 and stayed there till the end.
When one of his clients offered to sponsor him at a new location, he said he'd be happy to go.
Rodriguez, now 36, has left much of his life as it was.
The Verbe works with the same distributor of bagels and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has old Verba chandeliers.
But Rodriguez said he'd like to experiment, too.
He suggested new dishes.
The menu includes bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and there are capers or fried onion topping.
There's brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now makes freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many former customers were also squeezed out by Williamsburg prices", he shared.
One Sunday, Rebecca Olivier was one of those customers.
Olivier, now 34, used to live in Williamsburg and was a frequent visitor to The Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still came in.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verbe", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day she ordered a cuppage tea instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a loyal visitor to the Verb since 2003.
He'd come in before work and order the same thing over and over again.
"At fifteen minutes past eight, every day, as on the clock, I came, and they made me my bagel with butter and all the fillings", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but one day he'll change things up with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a beige with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended that the soap store once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Cherry suggested that a special soap be made for Verba, using cold-brewed coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer", said Rodriguez.
The Polish-born permanent residents of Greenpoint also loved the coffee.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for it in the showcase so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
A local juice store plans to pour bottles and sell cold-brew coffee.
There's a chance the coffee shop will be attached to the next building.
For many customers, the new Verb will be enough to include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in the new location, Whitt said that when he walked in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was back home.
"I've been wanting to smell this for a long time", he admitted.
Depressed food of depression at the Meat Lounge.
In March 1933, shortly after his inauguration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dinner in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: fried eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a blackcurrant pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering", Jane Siegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are experts in food history.
Kowa's latest book, Rag in Chinese, was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.
Their new collaborative work, "The Meal", to be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food during the Great Depression.
In a kind of culinary solidarity of their own, they met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple diner in Flatiron's neighborhood that has been open since 1929, the year of the stock market crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered a butter cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olive, and Coe, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple thought it was a good starting point for a discussion about food in the Depression.
"Roulette was in high demand", said Siegelman.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine you've eaten as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Cow is grumbling.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone", he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a dining table.
Groups of women cooked for the male farm workers, and freshly baked cakes were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "The Meal" describes how the country coped with the sudden loss of its status as a country of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally challenging: mysterious dishes like rolls and baked goods became staples; baking is "a great way to dispose of the crumbs", Siegelman observed, "because the chefs could hide the unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce".
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for many years was the staple of American food, has become a cheaply distributed luxury.
People tried strange blends because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of the era: baked onions, stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table has not been successful", said Coe.
Siegelman added: "It was very strange".
Peanut butter is not good for baked onions.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
Never before and never since, household experts - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Bureau from 1923 to 1943 - have been steering the nation's eating habits.
In their newspaper and magazine articles and recipes, they advised women to become "budget makers", to take up the challenge and turn the burdock of carrot-and-butter spaghetti into delicious dishes.
The "Dance" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Particularly piquant are the accounts of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let them eat cake" stance.
Publicly praising the humble farmhouse of his childhood in Iowa, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce", Coe said.
He ate in the almost gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife Eleanor not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested in taste, and as a result, the White House "used not only the most dismal food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked".
Many of the culinary tricks of the Depression were forgotten as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book they understood better the eating habits of Siegelman's mother - that she couldn't throw food away, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of carelessness about food", said Coe.
"It really poisoned people", Siegelman recalls.
There was one bad incident with the oil.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got a dessert they had made at home: the blackcurrant dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called musse from blackcurrant", Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes fancy names.
There was no whipped cream, just blackcurrant, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped the spoon into a sticky, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for more twice.
In a confident budget-maker's voice, he told his wife: "A few ruble walnuts would be good".
The arrest of the defendants in the case of the mass fight at the Khovan cemetery was extended until November 14
Presne court has left the defendants of the case of mass fighting at the Khovan cemetery under arrest until November 14, satisfying the relevant request of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
On May 14, a mass fight took place at the Khovan cemetery, in which several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus used weapons, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov were charged with organizing the murder.
The second indexation of pensions for 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have set specific parameters for how much we need to raise pensions in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All the calculations are done.
Now economists are summing up the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks", - quotes Interfax.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Center Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age by half a year every year, the vice-premier said that the Cabinet is not considering this topic.
In late July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it to the finals of the shooting competition from a small caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan have made it to the finals of the Olympic Games in Brazil, where they competed in shooting from a small caliber rifle while lying down.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan was second with 628.9 points.
Eight of the best athletes in the world made it to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen is demanding an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt", Gulen was quoted as saying by the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gülen denies any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had earlier arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
The coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of July 15 to 16.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of counsel in a patent dispute over hepatitis C with Merck.
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement for legal fees it incurred in a patent dispute over a hepatitis C drug with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc., a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was cleared of $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In her court appearance Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for the costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver disease patients.
The case was filed in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the lab work that underlies sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
The armed forces created with the support of the United States claim to have seized full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The armed forces, backed by the United States, have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city left.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are conducting a cleanup operation", he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State claimed an income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's potential vice president, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, and his wife, Anna Holton, released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency", Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind bogus excuses and breaking his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for candidates for president of the United States to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the IRS audit as the reason he refused to release his tax returns.
"Your move", tweeted Clinton campaign adviser Jan Sams, referring to the Democratic candidate's declaration.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the inspections were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raised questions about his wealth, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the issue and released an online video on Friday that highlighted prominent Republicans who were persuading Trump to release his tax returns.
She raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan on Thursday.
"He refuses to do what every single presidential candidate has done for decades: make his tax returns public", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that it may still be the case.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a debate in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would have guaranteed that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, offered Trump a meeting and an exchange of tax returns.
Buffett said he's under investigation by the IRS, too, and that Trump isn't "afraid" of the taxing agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign staff released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective gross tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from their salaries.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons reported a $109,000 dividend and capital gain.

Condoms with chile powder and fireworks increase protection for Tanzanian elephants
Environmental activists in Tanzania are using an unconventional method to prevent elephants from entering populated areas by throwing condoms filled with chili powder into them.
It worked, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Committee on Conservation, took it on board to promote it by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we invented the toolkit... we've seen a change in attitudes within these communities, which has resulted in them being much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming them", Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of the elephant that has broken the boundary and to signal with the horn.
If they can't scare him off, they throw what's called a "chilli cloud".
The chili powder is mixed with the soil, put with the cotton into the condom, and the end of the condom is twisted, leaving only the fuse on the outside.
When the condom is lit, it bursts with a roar, scattering fine powdered chili into the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant the other way.
The ultimate measure is a launch device that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Turkey has not yet returned 32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
This is what Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of them, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations", the head of the Turkish foreign ministry said.
In July, there was an attempted coup in Turkey.
The country's authorities officially declared that the coup had failed, and reported the detention of more than 6,000 people, including senior and middle-ranking military officers.
As a result of the coup attempt, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people were killed.
A Jewish filmmaker sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for deleting Israel's phone code at the "request" of Arabs, RT News reported.
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin has sparked a media scandal by discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel's telephone code on its list, with staff citing "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lantzman, author of the Holocaust documentary film "Shoah", expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lansman tried to find Israel on a telephone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
It was written by Lantzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to dial Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue on the hotel's administration desk.
The answer he received there, according to Lansman, "shocked him".
The hotel clerk said the move was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain".
The reason behind this move caused the director's anger even greater.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code for Israel be removed", said , according to Lanzmann, a hotel employee.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a terrible shame", reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's a shame, really.
What happened in Germany and in this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to come to the right conclusions", the official said.
The case caused a lot of buzz on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel was simply "taking the bait" of the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you",  said another post, which pointed out that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident "inspection" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast-track list", Kempinski's representative was quoted as saying by the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
She adds that the code is now added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
Under the proposals of the governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be reassigned to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against acting President Michael Temer.
This latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71 percent  RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagarian.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increased interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are re-establishing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran", Jagarian said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons", the ambassador said.
Jagarian also predicts that this year Russia will be visited by a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran has entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that the record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia last year will be broken", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, which have preserved monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
The state continues to tighten the noose in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was "systematic failure" to fulfill the instructions of the general director of the "Almaz-Antey" concern, "lack of work" and "loss of trust".
Head of the NGO for the next three years was appointed Gennady Bendersky.
News of Neskorodov's dismissal only came out Thursday night and did not cause widespread media coverage.
How can we explain such silence in the face of massive rearmament?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public sphere.
This once again confirms that the defense industrial complex (DIC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from the public.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly a significant event in terms of bringing order to the industry.
NPO "Almaz" is the head enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of sea and ground-based anti-aircraft missile systems (ASM).
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the ZRK "Poliment-Redut" and "Morpheus", which is planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of Military Russia portal Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the failure of the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the commissioning was expected in 2013.
The Polyment-Redut is to become the primary air defense system on the Navy's newest ships.
From the information I'm getting, there hasn't been a single really successful trial in years of testing.
True, as far as I can tell, there is no clear fault with the "Almaz", said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay with the commissioning of the S-500 can also occur.
The design and testing of the project is still not complete, but the first complexes are expected to enter service in 2016.
The Defense Ministry assures that "work is being carried out according to plan and everything will be completed within the set deadlines", although in 2014 the department admitted to having problems with the development of the S-500.
It's very difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been in charge of the "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev stated that deadline breaks on projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
According to him, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and the plans of the enterprise management.
The industry has received long-term orders worth tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as we know, loves silence.
As a rule, defense company directors leave their positions of their own volition, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension was public, although it didn't get a lot of traction.
This suggests that the head of the "Almaz" was perhaps a strict figure and resisted the "disarms" dropped from above.
It seems that this kind of behavior is no longer acceptable to the state.
It will remove those who prefer to dispute the Ministry of Defense's installations and fail to fulfill their tasks.
At the same time, the Russian leadership is seeking to punish the stewards who have been misled (the machinations at the "Zvezda" shipyard).
The President himself has given the sector a lot of attention.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and holds periodic meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the OPK's management, seeking to have a loyal board of directors who will carry out orders from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current defense situation is not catastrophic, of course, but the current geopolitical situation is stimulating the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of the managers in the defense industrial complex, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army's personnel acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigu as Minister of Defense.
It seems the president has adopted the well-known adage, "If you want peace, prepare for war".
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military might and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
For all the flaws in the bipolar system, it worked quite efficiently.
The absence of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved that.
The celebration of the "victorians" in the Cold War ultimately turned into a reinforcement of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no place left in the "civilized world" that is safe.
Despite the shared misery, the West refuses to talk to Russia on an equal level.
Under these conditions, the only allies of our country are the navy and the army.
The strengthening of its military might will allow Moscow to defend its national interests more effectively and to reach new frontiers in world politics.
Scot Callum Skinner races the finish line, leading the British to cycling gold
Scot Callum Skinner raced to victory in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, leading the British team trio to defend their 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the strongest, which his Scottish friend Sir Chris Howe made his own, and the youngster proudly made history by racing down the finish line to snatch the victory from the favourite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the surprise victory four years ago, winning when Hoye claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March track cycling world championships in London, despite the fact that Hoye had since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the expert contestant Jamie Staff.
They did that just around the time the Hinds came out.
Hoye's departure also created a void that Kean Emady and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held up by the British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scot, which was now realized.
Hindez, Kenny  champions with Hoye four years ago  and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold.
Hinds was right behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hinds was driving on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up.
Hoye was watching from his seat as a BBC guest expert and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped onto the podium.
"It's a flattering comparison", said Skinner, 23, from Glasgow.
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoye, Hinds admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a poor start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way for UK competitors to appeal.
There was no question of that this time in the greatest victory.
Hinds said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the stand".
We've all been meeting as a team for the last three months.
We'd lost so many world-class races, winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the Velo-Dummies are looking at five more successful days.
With the form Kenny has shown, it's not beyond the possibility of him repeating Hoya's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoye, who was also born on 23 March (which seems to be a holy date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Moh Farah and Roger Bannister) - bringing his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like with Hoya.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and runs for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competition is always the best.
You come here to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hinds said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
This was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified as the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record set at the 2012 London Olympics is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, the day before the qualifying race, when officials demanded he take his weight.
In the women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milwaukee improved the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the mid-Olympics and earn a stack of medals.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not least of which was the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures such as Hoye and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's race at the track, it seems that Britain's now legendary glory in reaching the summits at the right time may just be about to be repeated again.
Portland Metallurgical 's future at risk because of the power contract
The future of the Portland Aluminum Plant in Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, are at risk because the electric power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is a consequence of the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs  directly or indirectly  could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel mill consumes about 10 percent of all the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed its Point Henry steel plant, which led to the closure of the Englesey power plant last year.
The Portland steel plant of Alcoa is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of several years of deliberations about the future of the factory, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the factory's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expected the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling stake of the plant is held by a short-term joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with smaller stakes held by CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not cease", she said.
According to AGL, the contracts in question are so-called 'hedged contracts' that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they're actually due to expire in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring in their share of revenue in fiscal 2017", the electric utility said.
Any potential impact on AGL's earnings from the 2018 financial year onwards is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in view of the "coming termination".
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate a steel plant or provide electricity to a steel plant".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was due to expire in November, but it has yet to explain why it has terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the closure of both the Portland Metallurgical Plant in Victoria and the Tomaho Plant near Newcastle due to the industry's poor economic situation.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL's chief operating officer, Steven Mickelsen, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomaho uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants go out of business, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the market.
For us as a manufacturer, it will be bad", he said.
Not only is Kardashian a reality star, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue September.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of Kardashian-Jenner mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder and has walked the runway at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Sitting in a room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried", Kendall wrote.
The cover news was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of "The Kardashians") reality-video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the brothers Rob and Kaitlin, also joined by the show's favorite uncle, "The Kardashians" producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about the sister's appearance on the cover, and at the end - a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
This is a standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's television birthday shows (Sicrest says, "You thought we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the 8 a.m. show), but Chris needed to make sure that the glory somehow went to the other girls.
Because with this episode of Vogue September, we've definitely entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Kendall's older sister Kim has been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
The issue is more like a gift magazine than a fashion magazine, and attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages of last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
The news of which stars will be on the cover is so eagerly awaited that for the last two years the magazine's photos have merged before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrity models" than "celebrity models".
Oscar winner and face of Dior Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was given the honor.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, who the magazine described as the "top model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she's in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities, reality TV stars or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who are making it in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, it was one of the best years of her career, with the release of her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, due to her past as a reality TV star, was always supposed to remain shaky.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
That mood flared up again after news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there's no point in dwelling on the complaints.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's showing for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tonic from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you their photos on their own apps, which are available on a paid subscription.
She sells hand-drawn photos of her daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's on a reality TV show.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 vulnerable people refuse to be served by public legal centres as the sector prepares for the effect of further cutting funding for activities that are already running out of steam.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people who have no way to fight unjust dispossession, etc. - have already been turned away in their attempts to get free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, already operating beyond capacity, are preparing for further cuts.
By June of next year, these law centers are scheduled to lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Law Centres, said that according to the latest census report from the National Association of Community Law Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are constantly underfunded: this means that thousands of people are denied vital services", he said.
People who are leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, unfairly fired workers -- all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leaving thousands of less-protected Queenslanders to handle complex legal matters without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandes of Queensland to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to address the needs of the community legal centers and communities, their clients, and the Palachuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters has been sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters has been sued for allegedly failing to act after a report that its North Carolina operations director threatened an employee with a gun while they were riding in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he waited several months for the issue to be resolved internally, but realized "that's not going to happen".
Director Earl Phillip "picked out a pistol, placed his right index finger on the trigger and aimed the gun at Vincent's kneecap", Bordini claims in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal claims.
"Guns don't have to fire to cause damage", Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after the Republican presidential nominee made a splash by telling a North Carolina audience that "Second Amendment people" - understood as gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he did not speak out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for careless control, and from Phillip for threatening physical violence, acting out and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign headquarters.
When I called his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has campaigned controversially.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the District Court of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must redirect the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow .
Heathrow will also bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and to London as a whole, but to the whole country.
I think that was the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our people and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics have been a huge benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again, creating opportunities for the local people and businesses around Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we're going to create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case before London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heat is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered an 11 billion pound infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget, from T5 voted best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2 built in the middle of two of the busiest runways in the world.
Now they're ready to provide a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure the expansion of Heathrow will be too.
It is time for us to steer the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton  Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Trade Attorney to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat-and-mouse on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is a game of cat and mouse, according to one of the companies that makes such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users could update their filters in the app to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the labeling around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims they've been able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those who try to bypass it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking", and it's possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fray is a clear indication of how big an issue ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, almost four times the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who access Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for desktop ad blockers, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook's mobile apps for social networking and Instagram, according to the spokesperson.
But still, desktop advertising is a profitable enough item for Facebook to consider as a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are a concern, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"It will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this issue", a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway in an apparent suicide episode .
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was run over by multiple vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morge in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
In an apparent suicide attempt, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, struck multiple vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have been questioned, but the identities of some have yet to be established, police said, calling on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gille Hoffstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine", Hofsteiter said.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that the drivers will not be held accountable.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking in the dark on the highway - the ruling was that motorists cannot expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payne on a night in August 2014.
22-year-old victim was drinking and passed out on the road, court heard.
The court found that the female police officer who responded to the emergency call was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morge should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA's new climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Nashville have developed a model to study the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have had conditions similar to Earth.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus's low rotational speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But recent modeling suggests that Venus might have a thin atmosphere, like Earth, and still spin slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid regions than Earth, but it once had enough water and enough geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"According to the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation exposes its southern side to the sun for almost two months at a time", explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This heats up the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella that shields the planet's surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are, surprisingly, several degrees colder than on Earth today.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned up by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen was gone, all that was left was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche as head coach .
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and noted that the club will begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team, give it the depth it needed and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with the vision of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions affecting the team's work.
These conditions are not met at this time.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today", said Sakik.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs two years later.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record in the 2015-2016 season and were five points behind the Wild in the fight for the second seed in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers' strikes over the North Sea oil workers' salaries have been suspended and all sides to the discussion are embarking on a new round of negotiations, senior officials said.
Strikes against the oil services company Wood Group were sporadically organised on platforms in the North Sea, owned by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the current disputes", the joint statement said.
We're going to have a few full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week, to look at the issues in a fresh way.
The unions said their recent strike, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates paid to contractors working in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company's rate cut came after a 10 percent cut in rates for contract employees working on shore in 2014.
The company says the additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to cease oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, with the economic situation worsening after Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts to have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just a few", he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleiades.
The new data help astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades Cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning faster than they ever will again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these adult stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots  such as sunspots.
The latest rotation speed catalog suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Ryball compares stars to dancers: bigger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades ballet, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light", said Riball.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they are the perfect space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars", says Riball.
We want to know more about how, where and why stars slow down and hang their dancing shoes on the nail, so to speak.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotational velocities of the Pleiades in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are investigating the activities of a group of Ukrainian dissidents detained in Crimea, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is gathering evidence of the arrests' involvement in preparing sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Yevgeny Panov, agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Armenian chemical plant "Titan", the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as objects for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that they have not caught all the accomplices of the saboteurs.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov became head coach of Russia 's national football team
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be calculated for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive of the Russian Football Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a famous footballer, previously played in Moscow "Sparta" in the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a coach of such Russian teams as the same "Sparta", "Jemchuzhina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as the Warsaw "Legion", which became the winner of the national championship and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with Churchesov will be signed in the near future and is calculated for two years.
So he's the one who's got the responsibility of preparing the team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the salaries of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the Russian Federation's leadership has set Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of taking the Russian team to the semifinals and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers creating a competitive environment in the team as a priority and is going to give the players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he's glad the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Recall that earlier the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching in the club of CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the Russian national team's failed performance at Euro 2016 in France.
He took responsibility for the team's poor performance.
Squeezed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, the country of 2.4 million people has made tremendous progress, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government is paying a lot of attention to education.
While people in developed lands take for granted free primary and secondary education, many poor countries charge tuition fees for secondary and even primary schools.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to "reimburse the cost".
However, in Namibia, primary schooling is free.
Moreover, since 2015 secondary education has also become free.
The authorities are also actively working on other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the annual incidence of malaria by 97% in the last decade.
In contrast to the international trend of increasing inequality, Namibia is shrinking.
Compared with 1993, the Gini coefficient, the standard indicator of income inequality, has fallen by 15 points.
Back then, 23 years ago, it was one of the highest rates in the world.
And the poverty rate has dropped from 69 percent in 1993 to less than 30 percent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 a day) has also fallen from almost 53 percent to less than 23 percent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was well ahead of the United States and other rich nations.
It also has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index" compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even now, when raw materials prices are falling, Namibia is managing to maintain a high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, less than one-third of the level of debt in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has its problems.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional methods, remains fairly high, at almost 28%.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS with almost 17% of the population being infected.
The World Bank estimates Namibia to be among the countries with higher than average incomes, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the challenges that are inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the country's deserts, isolated nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes live, who must somehow be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the global economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
Namibia is even more challenging, as it is facing the effects of climate change, just like any other country in the world.
But Namibia has not given up, and the country is solving the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It's remarkable that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides affordable health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of the medical visitors in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that they were not choosing their neighbors, so they decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment and student exchange.
Furthermore, the Namibian government rightly reasoned that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, enriching the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the income from Namibia's natural resources must be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from the sale of the country's resources, and they are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that's the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Geingob has noted, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhaustive.
Some, like fishing, are renewable, and the government is doing everything it can to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low development - can set out on a path to shared prosperity.
Her achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna", the oldest gold objects ever made by man (4600-4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the most sensational archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand, weighing a total of 6 kilograms.
From one burial site, known as "Tomb No. 43", 990 gold objects weighing over 1.5 kg were recovered.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon be replaced by the ghostly bead that archaeologists found in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunitsit is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunitsit of the Pazarjik district.
The bead is a gold strip wrapped in a ring.
Javor Boyadjiev, the head of excavations at Tella Yunatsit, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The Varna treasures, we remind, date from approximately the same period, 4600-4200 years before our era.
No technology exists to date metal with perfect accuracy.
How can we be sure which gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyadjiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Yunatsis is older than the gold of Varna".
It is a find of extreme importance: small in appearance, yet large enough to occupy a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadjiev said that scientists will soon analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Junacite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Today, Tell Yunatsite is considered the oldest city in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, the region experienced a rapid development in metal processing, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpatian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, settlements of the city type began to appear around the centers of metalworking.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatsite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts dating back to 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunatsit a prototype of a modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Sumer", says Boyadjiev, referring to the commonly held view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia - modern-day Iraq.
There the first cities in the usual sense of the word arose.
The excavations of Tell Yunacite have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated nearly 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Remains of a fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
Little remains of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban density, "business center" and residential suburbs.
Tell Junacite is often called the "Birds' City": dozens of clay bird figures have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of rest, which suggests that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local cult.
The "Birds City" was destroyed about 4100 B.C.E. - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-meter-high fortified walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with marks of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts are emerging every year, changing the way we think about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
The "gold of Varna", discovered relatively recently, in 1972, was a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization.
Logically, Varna's golden luxury must have been preceded by something like a tiny golden bead created at Telle Juniati.
Porsche has artificially aged the 911 Targa
Officially, the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being hand-crafted by the department's specialists who work with the production cars.
The "retro-look" is, for example, the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received a brand-new white graphics along the boards and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some details of the body design, painted in "white-gold metallic".
The interior of the retro-lined rooms is noticeably smaller: it is distinguished, in large part, by gray-blue decoration, new chairs with expanded electrical adjustment ranges and black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, each buyer will receive a car case and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant was not touched by the Porsche Exclusive specialists: the retro-tank is quite similar to the serial one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 l, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited editions, but neither the volume nor the price of each specific sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers have launched an arms race
Facebook's recent introduction of technology to prevent ads from being hidden on social networking pages has prompted developers to block ads for retaliatory actions.
AdBlock Plus has released an "antidote", but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus is promoting their new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The social network said that in an attempt to trick the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, AdBlock Plus' solution, along with commercial ads, blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret over the policy and promised to resolve the issue soon.
A source within the social networking community told TechCrunch that the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop site will be ready within the next few hours.
So, the social network and the blockers have launched a kind of "arms race" to try to beat each other, while the victims have been users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw an advertisement where they weren't used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear before the court.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is a very serious one, sexual assault.
The investigation found that in late November 2015, the accused committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl in the Pavlov Street area of Murmansk.
The penalty for this article is a maximum sentence of up to six years in prison.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia the crossover Fengguang 370 and the pickup Rich New - site behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of a class of cars that is gaining popularity in China, combining the virtues of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms have decided to ignore this year's Moscow International Auto Show, so the empty exhibition halls of the Crocus Expo will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has a large view on the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting novelties in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring for 55 900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand rubles at current exchange rates).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, the Fengguang 370 managed to reach the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans in June, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic lining on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be quite well classified as a crossover.
The crossover is built on the front-wheel-drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, with the 370 having the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden panels, but the large vertical touchscreen "like Tesla's" on the center console was only on early exhibition copies of the crossover, and cars with "music" came into sale more easily.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading area with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the luggage compartment is 1500 l.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - a 1.5-liter petrol "atmospheric" engine with a power of 115 hp, coupled with a 5-speed mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a sparing budget of the owner's appetite at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly refined design by Chinese stylists.
Despite its morally outdated design, this model is still in steady demand among Chinese consumers as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse".
At a similar price, Rich New will surely interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become exorbitantly expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: petrol 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
The gearbox is mechanical only, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and a hard-wired "front".
The new flagship A9 sedan will be on the Dongfeng stand, and the Chinese firm's representative office announced its Russian premiere in June.
The Chinese market is becoming increasingly crowded with minivan-like crossovers, with the latest models being the Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian line of Dongfeng consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers have sold 696 cars in our country.
No more postal notifications for transport tax - www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the way property taxes are notified.
All Russian car owners are used to the scheme that has not changed for years: in summer and autumn they receive by mail a receipt for the payment of the transport tax for the previous year.
But this year, many will not.
The fact is, the tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for notifying citizens without much fuss.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Taxpayer's Office" on the official website nalog.ru will receive the notification electronically.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians to be online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mail.
The innovation will affect all vehicle and real estate owners.
Everyone else will still be getting the usual mail.
However, the old scheme is also available to those who have a website account.
They will have to go to the tax office during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the completion, whereas the letter will take several days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the tax office's Internet service has surpassed 18 million, which will allow the agency to save significantly on mail.
On the other hand, a modest news story on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform the public about the changed procedure.
Some could have registered in a "personal office" for a one-time service and forgot about it.
These people will not wait for the email notification and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of nonpayers with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal Cabinet of the taxpayer" is made in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
You can get it personally at any tax inspection office (regardless of where you put it on the record).
We remind you that this year, you have to pay the transportation tax before December 1st.
The notification started in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-Class tuning car, which has been modified to achieve very high performance, is a thing of the past.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the G-Power company, who set about modifying the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its fondness for BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its makers.
Indeed, why not upgrade the G 63 - a 571-horsepower flying car with tank aerodynamics and a sprint to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
By pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helix", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter super-inflatable "eight" opens.
But the dynamics of the displacement to the hundred improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 seconds, and now the flying brick is capable of a leap in 5.3 seconds.
However, the acceleration from medium speeds is probably much better.
The speed limit is intimidating: if the standard G 63 does not go faster than 210 km/h, then the tuning all-terrain vehicle with the deactivated electronic "collar" is capable of pushing 250 km/h.
On the outside, the car is virtually indistinguishable from its factory original, except for the other wheel discs - the 23-inch Hurricane RR, which is a 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a stunning concept coupe 6m long, which will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green sub-brand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate trademark.
At least four new environmental innovations are expected to emerge in the coming years.
