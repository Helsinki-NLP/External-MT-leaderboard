What should it do, the ČSSD? Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery."
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the City Council in general.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz once "tapped" members of the new ČSSD council on how to master the notorious slang that has become established in recent years, when the current coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the best-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils appeared to be somewhat in the dark about the terms.
Or so they claim.
"Who is Voldemort?"
'I don't know. '
"I am rather a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, reacted to the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
But councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golf hole."
'That's the only expression of what you're putting here that I use now and then. '
'Other than that, I don't think much of slang. '
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editors picked six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "biggest Prague golf hole," "go to the pastry shop," "bullneck," "betrayal of the capital" and "bleach."
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, and the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - initially promised to take part in the interview, but then did not even listen.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
'I don't care about these things and how the Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge them on that. '
"What matters to me is how we understand each other in our programs," he countered.
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not recognize in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, was being mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" means absolutely nothing to Kaucky, and the only word he correctly guessed in the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole."
"That's the tunnel," Kaucky says, but adds for safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly: 'I'll probably have to take a language course.'
Not only matador Karel Březina, but also Lukáš Plachý, Councillor for the Environment, deciphered the "golf hole" correctly as Tunnel Blanka.
But both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even guesses where this figure can be found, and thus what it means to "go to the confectionery."
"I think that means going to some restaurant in Prague," Plachý is quite close to solving the riddle, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than from his own vocabulary.
Judging by the test takers, there really does not seem to be any similarly naturalized slang among the social democrats.
'I've also asked my colleagues, but obviously we don't have anything like that. '
"We call each other by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says Prague ČSSD leader Petr Hulínský - nicknamed "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and lo and behold - it works.
Councillor Weinert is the "grandpa" or, less kindly, the "old man" to his party comrades. Representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention before the elections by sponsoring the party, is referred to by some colleagues as "Igráček" (a well-known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing the Social Democrats allow in internal party parlance.
Hulínský allegedly does not like to be called "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheon rights" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský obtained his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and has issued a pamphlet
Women who are branded witches in Burkina Faso usually share some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
If one of these women "becomes" a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared because they help at work and give birth to children," is how a nun describes the situation in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso for more than a hundred women who have been abandoned by their communities.
The local government decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason, it issued a pamphlet aimed at stopping the "witch hunt."
But there is a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they doused her with kerosene and simply set her on fire.
The incident was also reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the affair was just a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil was ignited and used for ritual anointing.
This was after the group had tried to "drive out" an "evil spirit" from the woman.
The people here support the isolation of "witches" without regard to their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Eaters of human souls are a danger, both in the past and now," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the President of the Gambia himself got involved last year.
'President Yahya Jammeh unleashed a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly participated in her death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic. '
"To this end, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, abducted women and men indiscriminately from Gambian villages and took them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, incarcerated people were forced to drink a decoction of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly one thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - but still pays higher rent
An elderly stocky man is leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a folder with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just had their rents increased as part of so-called "deregulation."
Instead of 3500 kronor monthly rent, the son is to fork out 4100 kronor next year for a two-room apartment with a second-class kitchen.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment, and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he angrily taps his finger at his son's new lease, which he has power of attorney to sign.
"But what - I signed it," he declares, half upset and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease conditions "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it intends to publish instructions on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man is just waving away.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region will thus become a great "deregulation laboratory."
After the New Year, this deregulation will apply to the majority of rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid rent in line with the market.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday it is full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with them an access device.
"Rent 2011," a special touch panel lights up on the touchscreen.
Just tap and the device spits out a numberplate.
No sooner have we deciphered the number "157" than it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room evidently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
From mid-November, envelopes with the new lease agreements will be sent to the letterboxes of most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio in the Ostrava region.
In the letters, the RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rents in the Client Centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action lasts a little over a week, which means that this is just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter answer after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners "housing are a hot topic.
Before the elections, Lubomír Zaorálek, a parliamentary vice-president from Ostrava, from the ČSSD, had raised this issue quite loudly, and it is no wonder that newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change some damn toilet goggles," the aforementioned man exclaims.
So far, according to the employees, it is mainly pensioners who are waiting at the counter to see if they really receive the promised tenant discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer on time.
Other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15 will also benefit from a half-price reduction in February rent.
So far, however, the "deregulation counter" in Havířov is anything but overburdened by demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were here for rent in 2011," the counter clerk estimates.
RPG offers individual rental agreements, where necessary, both on its websites and on blackboards.
However, if the parties fail to agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent tribunal.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal course of action," RPG explains on its website.
"Nobody is going to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client centre agrees with her, at least in part.
"I have a pension of 13,000 (kroner), of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court case," he says.
Then the employee becomes unsure.
'Let's see. '
"Mr. Zaorálek is telling them through the media not to sign, so people are still waiting," she said.
Regulated rent expires in most of the Czech Republic on New Year's Day 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty, argues that the existing level of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund. According to the landlords, neglect of the housing fund, which has been criticised by angry tenants, is the main reason for the increase in rents.
Whereas RPG was able to invest four billion from the rents it received in the years between 2005 and 2010, the figure for the four years from 2011 to 2014 is said to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the Havířov waiting room, a few pieces of illuminated red information keep popping up.
"The rent increases in 2011 of 15% or less affect 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre per month," says the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio will see rents rise by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, it's about raising extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square metre," RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not push rents up by leaps and bounds, but will be phased in over four and eight years.
What's more, the company has another obligation: The company wants to reinvest all income from the rent increase (see diagram) in apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - primarily - these should benefit those people who sign agreements to increase rents.
The architects took a look - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with all that goes with it: colourful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
From the very first designs for the new Avriopoint building, the design and architecture firm Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole range of well-known Brno buildings originate, counted on the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
Wise foresight, because most of its 90 employees are baby boomers, and the company is keen for the designers and architects to return to work as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shorter hours, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding profession with child care.
The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they were able to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and qualified personnel and operations provided for a period of 2 years.
After the funds have been used up (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, and Economy Rating provided active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are looked after by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can be attended by children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, although several children take turns during the day.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it concerns individual education and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten are nevertheless comparable to the supporting programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, and they also learn English at the same time.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a calculator available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can have a look at the children at any time and thus the stress of late pick-up of the children from a far away kindergarten is eliminated.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also developing here.
Arch.Design thus ranks among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are cracked fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house, with its organic shapes, was nicknamed the "bone house" by the local inhabitants.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the scales-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines are all typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures that recall nature and living creatures.
Only on closer inspection one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well thought-out order.
At night, the entire façade appears even more vivid and dramatic, and the special illumination intensifies the brilliance of the colours.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy-shaped wood copies window frames, railings, door trims, even peepholes and moldings.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district, on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43, was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new one, but in the end he agreed to Gaudí "s idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design Casa Batlló alone.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real owner were created and the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea.
Numerous other artists and artists also contributed to the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was also involved in the construction of Gaudí "s Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the local inhabitants nicknamed the house the "bone house" because of its organic shapes.
Others called it the "yawning house" because of its special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique at the time, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination already seems a bit bizarre.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all building codes of that time and did not let himself be deterred by them.
Prior to the start of construction, he obtained planning permission from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so appalled by the result when it was completed two years later that they demanded a remedy.
The councillors were also offended by the fact that the building, with its pillars, even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, no changes were made. On the contrary, Josep Batlló applied for permission to lease the two highest floors of the building just fifteen days after the neighbourhood asked him to do so, and it was promptly granted.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building goes up a flight of stairs to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reconstruction eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting rooms.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger company could chat comfortably, without having to renounce a certain intimacy in more intimate conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two further floors as a result of Gaudí "s reconstruction.
Gaudí "s play with light is also impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles that cover the courtyard and the atriums.
The interplay of these two colours lends maximum light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colours, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Casa Batlló, which was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is now open to the public.
On the first floor, the most spacious and sumptuous apartment is opened to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year to mark the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it became clear that this was a very profitable business, the tours were retained and extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for a visit to the monument is not a cardboard box, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its little dragon turrets, you should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - weight, height, state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which the mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where heating is not regular, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not impossible that mould may form underneath them.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the election.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Probably all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep properly here anymore."
"They simply need a soft layer of viscisco foam (a shape memory polymer) for their toned shoulders, heels and hips."
"Among others, I recommend them to people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they are unable to receive the" information "from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specialises in upholstered furniture.
For this reason, I have provided many ice hockey players, but also other customers with these mattresses with visco foam (memory foam) years ago.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by manufacturers such as Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of viscisco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally clings to the warm body.
Nowhere is it squeezing, at night you don't roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (gangrene).
When choosing the size of the mattress, the length of the soles of the feet should still be added to the height, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are about 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of lying width at their disposal, i.e. a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of convenience and also for eventual visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly bent arms," advises Helena Prokopová, guild master of upholstery and interior decorators, who has devoted herself for years to the problems of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and who also lectures on this topic at specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattress is the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grates at different heights and this is by no means possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be accounted for by the moulded layer and the fine upholstery.
"You should not feel the feathers with your hand or while sitting down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and mattress like conjoined Siamese twins have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already the norm today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve.
This is one of the reasons why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee, for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And here is some practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is still advisable to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Although nowadays mattress covers are usually made with a full zip so that once opened you get two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), tampering with larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often feels like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid slab in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, you should rather provide the board with ventilation holes (as long as there are no holes in it) and use mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with a pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slats with 14 to 18 spring strips (slats). Grates with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 or more spring strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility of regulating the slats hardness always pay off.
Adjustable slats are not suitable for mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring strips, which enables the spring strips to be pressed in or even angled in such a way that they permit the sleeper's shoulder to sink selectively.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft areas for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses."
The ladies are also thought of - you can treat them to these soft areas in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsional springs are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the advantages will be lost.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow, as the Scandinavians like it, seems ideal.
In the lateral position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
Also with mattresses the new magic word is called "bio."
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils - such as castor and soybean oil - are increasingly being used to produce polyurethane foams.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"For mattresses, organic means that their core is made of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread the scent of fresh forest or lavender when you sleep.
Here, too, a distinction is made between a man and a woman.
Whereas for men a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, for women the covers have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets pleasantly warm when sleeping.
And today's favourites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness of cold foams and viscous foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to fork out 7000 crowns or more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged less VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
As you can see, saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors offering two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with quilted Visco Memory foam for CZK 11,990.
The second one you get for free.
It was the Tempur material that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, since they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft at warmth, and solidifies in a cool environment.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but also increases overall sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to relieve the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people-monitoring devices to keep kids under control
Fear for their own children is growing, and more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, is just as capable of locating people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as in the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet, but will soon be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people are frightened by the case of Anička, who disappeared, and are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of compromising their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS positioning devices on the Czech market.
'I recognise that there can be misuse of such devices on a case-by-case basis, for example when you put it in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not had a case like this before. '
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
'Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things when they don't want to be controlled. '
"Even mobile phones aroused great expectations among parents at the beginning, but they are just as easy to switch off as these new monitoring devices," says Ms Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also debatable whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with him or her that could be used to locate him or her."
'Today it's the phone. '
'If such surveillance devices were more widely used, they'd be looking for them as well, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising. '
"In these cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she acknowledges that similar devices can be useful in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices, there is even a clinometer integrated, which means that if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also be provided by intelligent mobile phones with navigation, all you need to do is install special software.
The problem with current positioning devices is that they are either match-box-sized devices that resemble trailers, or smaller cell phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin of Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are currently being tested.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or positioning device.
"Or he only notices it after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a head start," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards wristbands or pendants, the same technology is always used as for vehicle location.
This is a combination of the positioning function with the help of the GPS system (just like with the sat nav in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The Army has so many fuses that you could wrap all over them but only last two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of fuses to be detonated with IEDs.
The year before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the Armed Forces have spent 225 years on the front line.
The only problem is the durability of the fuses - two years at most, but four years at most.
The army bought the fuses from the public company STV Group, a. s. for a paltry 40 million kroner.
In its justification for the purchase of this enormous quantity of fuse, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume about 60 kilometers of fuse annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES spoke to, this information indicates that the whole army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek were not exempt.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses be reasonably justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations, by the way.
But even so, these armies would last for more than ten years.
If, however, the old expert rule still applies that two metres of fuse are completely sufficient to train every new professional soldier, then the army has created a calming supply for itself for the 225 years already mentioned, also in view of the increased demand of the pioneering and special forces.
Soldiers from the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so shooting exercises are severely limited because of a lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
'I don't see why they buy such huge quantities of fuses from us. '
But at the end of the day, that's their decision, they'll know what they need it for. '
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as dealers want to meet as much as possible," says Jan Děcký, sales manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of fuse by saying that the army has been stocking up on this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year service life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"If stored perfectly, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, who wishes to remain unnamed so as not to be accused of criticising the army as a soldier.
At the end of their service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not free of charge, however, but cost additional money.
Another argument put forward by the Ministry of Defence is the volume discount for the 445 kilometres of fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pejšek tells us about the position of the Defense Ministry purchasers.
Just for comparison, the annual consumption of fuses by police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army has barely exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police only ever order such quantities of ammunition, which they can consume before the end of their useful life.
Already for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition one keeps the possibility for flexible purchases of modern and thus also reliable ignition lines open.
The Ministry of Defence already has huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty period, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians spoken to by MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces will face the same problem in liquidating hundreds of kilometres of old fuses that they bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day, the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition come in handy.
The winning placement in the Small Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year's winner of the Small Entrepreneur of the Year competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he became aware of the lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
With the savings from his holidays abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-year college student at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me, so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all the profits back into the house, which he then converted step by step into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has opened four boarding houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star "Pytloun Design Hotel."
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise have already come forward," says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
"The victory in the" Entrepreneur of the Year "competition was a major factor in this sale of licences to operate hotels," Mr Pytloun adds appreciatively.
Victory has brought him greater fame and even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognised me in the street, they often congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, any visibility is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would not have happened otherwise.
'I still have regular business relationships with some of the people I've met through the competition. '
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also has a little impact on each of his employees.
And since he has about seventy.
'I've noticed greater loyalty and pride in them being part of something that is universally recognised. '
I really don't see this as just a personal success, no, it's the result of all of us doing a good job. '
"My name has only come a little bit to the fore," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his single-mindedness, Farmet has put the worst behind him.
The award for the first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year went to Karel Žďárský, the owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated his efforts in turning the small tool shop in Česká Skalice into a company with hundreds of millions of turnover.
"I can say that this recognition has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees, and strengthened our self-confidence in the struggle with the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history there was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, abandoned his career in the company where he had worked until then and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs together with some of his father's comrades.
A short time later they started to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the whole of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only did our customers perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also started to attach greater value to the fact that they could cooperate with a company that had achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
At Farmet, however, the past year was not only marked by euphoria of victory.
The evaluation was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 in particular was the most difficult year for the sales of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at the time was shaking not so much citizens, but companies in particular, was just reaching its climax - many firms were forced to suspend their investment projects and restrict purchases of new facilities and technologies.
'Of course we couldn't escape that situation either. '
"Turnover fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and even make redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to cut back on investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have emerged from the crisis.
Turnover is growing again, and with it the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Žďárský says.
An Opinion Poll Clearing Up Nonsensical Rules
The "Absurdity of the Year" poll is part of the entrepreneurship contest for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already succeeded in getting rid of them.
The dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" poll was the obligation to create documents on agencies that are available online.
For example, more than a third of less than four thousand entrepreneurs who voted decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper excerpt from the Commercial Register, even if the official could have retrieved it with two clicks of the mouse.
Now, thanks to the opinion polls, that is changing.
"In future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register when inspecting social security payers," said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The purpose of the "Absurdity of the Year" survey is to examine all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to abolish the nonsensical ones.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech business newspaper (HN), which is enjoying growing popularity among the public.
If last year there were about three thousand people voting, this year there were four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"For example, in terms of the number of income tax forms, we are one of the world's leading companies," says Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2000 and takes place in the same scenario every year.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the competition closes at the end of September.
The website www.firmaroku.cz. The organizer of the competition then chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's opinion poll has already registered more than a hundred, or more precisely 105, pointless rules and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions requiring motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles to pay tolls or requiring entrepreneurs with twenty employees to install two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the competition's website.
The proclamation of the competition on Wenceslas Square in Prague at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, took part in the highlight of the competition.
"If the state throws clubs at entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, which is why my aim is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily hinder entrepreneurs in their endeavours," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical orders are having an effect.
In 2007, the most annoying thing for people was the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the Trade Office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or fair with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office business trips of employees of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "green card."
And - all good things are three:
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation that required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two bathroom scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat softened by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement was dropped.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010."
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafone, which is the promoter and guarantor of this competition, as well as of the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
This year, the first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year was attended by companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is highly inspiring and would provide enough material for a stand-alone article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have one common denominator - support and consideration.
We are talking, for example, about handicapped people, personal problems or the health of our own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, Prague software company Et Netera appeared, for example, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also provides exemplary care to its health-handicapped employees, who make up 70% of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it came third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the winner was MiRyz Soft, an accounting firm, which, among other things, introduced fluent working hours, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a disproportionate reduction in wages.
At the award ceremony, the jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens "initiatives in its vicinity and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We try to recycle as much as possible in order to minimize the impact of our entrepreneurial activities and administration on the environment," explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústí nad Labem, on the other hand, is concerned about the health of its employees, which is why it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, furthermore, it promotes homework among its employees and uses cartering services provided by a protected local workshop for company events.
"In addition, we support the foundation" People in Need, "which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with food, transport, upgrading their qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered for the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions on the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser no later than 15 August.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they were not disqualified in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to register separately only for this competition, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of police during a public tender
In recent days, anti-corruption police have made arrests at the Land Fund building in Pilsen.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was led away in handcuffs by the detectives.
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition currently taking place to settle restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party.
He is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraud in a public competition," Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsen prosecutor's office, told the newspaper "Právo," she could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by police 24 hours later.
How he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated upon, given the scant official information.
The spokeswoman of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá stated, in response to Právo's question on the matter, that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsen branch of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she said.
According to Ms Černá, the public competition had the correct name "Call for tenders for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the offered land.
"In the context of the request, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled through the transfer than the declared property value."
"The order of potential buyers will be determined in accordance with the claims being offered, and the land fund will then transfer the property to the person with the highest offer," says the fund's spokeswoman.
Luboš G. obviously had information about who had registered at the request and as he himself was a legitimate person, having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a real estate interest to withdraw from the competition.
Evidently against a fat severance payment.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had very good contacts with the Pilsen Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in substitute restitutions for which decisions had already been made on the location of construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also purchased land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access road to the Borské pole industrial estate was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give in with a heavy heart in order not to endanger the building project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred a month
As of January, households will not only face higher costs for all forms of energy, but also higher water and sewage charges, and rent increases for district heating and in some places.
Families will have to take several hundred kroner out of their wallets every month from January onwards.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent or more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places district heating supplies will also become more expensive.
Electricity prices alone cost households several hundred crowns more each year.
The high electricity prices have been lowered by all the main suppliers, which is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic systems.
Gas will only become moderately more expensive, but precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, we can expect several hundred kroner more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger towns, in particular, are planning price hikes.
For example, from January households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kronor more per month for district heating, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 kronor more per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, are threatened with a 9% increase in water and sewage charges if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague, however, is still one of the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge increases in rents are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rent regulation will cease to apply from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100 percent as of January.
Those who do not agree with this rent increase will be prosecuted by the company.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes, are expected to rise by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunken Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen most often need emergency treatment.
Children who repeatedly have to sleep off their hangovers in hospital are no exception.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the children's departments of clinics.
'Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk, 'she said.
"Today's trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head of the paediatric department at the Central Bohemian Clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if you manage to steal a bottle from your father's house bar, and if you don't, at least fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, so it doesn't smell as strong," explains the head doctor.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"It's mostly fernet or rum."
'That's the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools. '
"It was also about Slibowitz, who you take from home," Ms. Jurinová said.
According to Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are by no means an exception in hospital admissions.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Motol hospital, where ambulances delivered drunken pupils from near and far.
'One girl's had to be hospitalised four times. '
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was admitted for the first time with 3.5 per cent alcohol in her blood and in combination with" ectase, "" the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at some dance party in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief medical officer marvels.
It is precisely the lack of interest on the part of parents or their incredible tolerance when toasting their own offspring that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
Experts say that children are not really addicted in the true sense of the word.
'Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic addiction to alcohol and all that goes with it, and that's not the case with these children. '
Those who repeatedly drink alcohol tend to have a negative familial-social background, "explains Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Mrs. Jurinová, by mid-November, about forty drunken children had been admitted to the local Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospitalisation, are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after out-patient treatment by their parents or, if necessary, by the police are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children only drink a bottle of liquor in the classroom, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes that can be 100% relied on: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow because of the bad testimony or out of joy for the holidays."
"On Walpurgis Night, I have already seen seven drunken children at once in the recording," Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to deal with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency can be cured in the hospital with a fluid infusion of glucose and nutrients lacking in the body.
"They are clearly better off because after the" marvellous "experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without anything hurting."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, sometimes spoiling patients "good mood by telling them the cost of treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time I have used this as a means of education, when I have directly calculated to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it may well happen that they have to work all the holidays in order to earn the money for a single such party," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures in order to demand the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light combat aircraft out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defence has replaced with the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been owned by a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen at manoeuvres or air shows abroad.
This is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, which was taken over last week by the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol.
Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, said it was not yet known when the aircraft would physically leave Vodochody.
The single-seat L-159 fighter aircraft, on the other hand, were removed from long-term storage aircraft without any further input or investment on the part of the ministry.
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its present condition and appearance," Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the Army will not have to do without two-seater fighter jets since the Defense Ministry signed a $200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159s into a two-seater version.
The army took over one new aircraft in July, and plans to take over the second by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS is committed to integrating the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a purchaser of the L-159 aircraft and that these are to be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he implements the project," said Pejšek.
The business daily (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
Last year, the government of Mirek Topolánek approved the barter of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The Department of Defense at the time argued that the swap would support the future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 aircraft, of which it used only 24, and wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of the planes is also likely to have a legal fallout.
The European Commission has taken the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by targeting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes, the last of which is due to land at Kbely airport within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That's the surprising finding of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be linked to levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men up to 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health issues, Ms Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer in Britain, as well as 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men were as likely to develop prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and by 87 percent in men up to the age of sixty.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone equals a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was not aware of the study, but that the link between finger length and cancer risk had not yet been "fully proven."
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic lies under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and pavements are mostly covered with frozen snow, and winter workers were on the move throughout the night in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to a number of accidents involving lorries and cars, and the D1 motorway near Brno in the direction of Prague is also closed.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometre 91 a lorry crashed, at kilometre 93 two lorries collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems with kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two lorries collided.
Drivers should leave Brno at 190 km or drive over Brno and drive up to Kývalka at 182 km.
This is where miles of traffic jams form.
There was also an accident on the D11, right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Motorcades are formed, for example, in Prosek, and Štěrboholská Street is also completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Unit meets.
There are also problems with the railways and the airfield.
Czech State Railways had to cancel seven high-speed trains due to snow drifts.
Problems exist, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. since Wednesday.
Most roads in South Moravia are passable only with increased caution.
Three secondary roads around Vyškov are completely impassable, snow drifts form in places in the vicinity of Brno and in the vicinity of Blansko it is necessary to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There, three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too, snow blowers will have to be used to clear the snow.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will become passable again.
Caution should be exercised in the area of the White Carpathians in the Hodonín region.
On the roads, which for nature conservation reasons can only be spread with inert spreading agents, there is a snow cover up to five centimetres thick, ČTK explained.
Fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres in the Czech Republic, most of it in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimetres in places.
Up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
For the first time, American troops have deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only by its code name, XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed by lasers with a precision of only a few metres to the target.
The special bullets of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, they can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
Usually it is not protected from above, so the murderous rain of steel splinters from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who helped develop the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to harness "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact sight point, after which he corrects the angle of rise, then he only has to pull the trigger.
'Let's say they measured 543 metres. '
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires the bullet at a distance of 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs to be relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The industry giant, which specialises in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday that in July next year 400 men and women will move their workplaces from the existing office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, an additional 100 jobs of the group should be accommodated there, which have so far been spread across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in the Astro Park were better suited to the working methods of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Markus Frank, head of the Frankfurt Economic Affairs Department (CDU), said that once again a "global player" had been won.
He said it was a "great commitment."
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed of the intention by management at an early stage.
"We obviously offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
The friendly contacts, however, could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have been the decisive factor.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the house on the Town Hall Square used by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" together with the other buildings on Marienbad Square were among the most controversial building projects in the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city tree was created between the station and the town hall, which attracted criticism both for the massive development of the areas previously partly used as parking lots and for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still affiliated with Siemens, moved into the premises.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu describes itself as the third-largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu employs far more people in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square metres were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped layout - is home to, among others, the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronics Industry.
Amazon suspends servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is coming under increasing pressure.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind this, following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American servers and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks ousted from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
When publishing the secret diplomatic cables, Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
Commenting on the move, Wikileaks said via Twitter: 'Great - our dollars are now being spent on employing people in Europe.'
If Amazon has such a free-speech problem, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon halted Wikileaks' use of its servers after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the Guardian reported.
'I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner, given WikiLeaks' prior releases of classified information, 'the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from being used in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, egregious and reckless actions are putting our national security at risk and endangering lives around the globe," the nonpartisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, American or foreign, should help Wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
The 39-year-old Australian is in the UK and the exact location is known to Scotland Yard, according to a report by London newspaper The Independent.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
In London, Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there had been threats.
'There have even been calls for Julian Assange's assassination. '
That's why Assange is right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - obviously ironically - on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a fight broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent leaks of espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The US government is now undertaking a major review of the protection of its databases.
Russell Travers, the deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Policies, has been appointed as special envoy, the White House said.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that became necessary after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways the entire government shares and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the WikiLeaks release.
"We have made every effort to contact them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
'We stand ready to protect them should that become necessary, 'he said.
The Ice University
At the Gelato University near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri attracts the largest number of visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice actually come from?
From the gelatica and gelataio.
Gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter with a spatula, spreads it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't miss the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice Cream University was set up by the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri attracts the largest number of visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some people dream of a new career in their mid-life crisis, others simply dare to venture on the ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary and Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something of her own after years in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
What matters is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the icing on the cake of the national and generally southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is plenty of romance."
The first step to production seems very simple.
Luciano tips the basic ingredients milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cool it down to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you give free rein to your own experimentation?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who refers to ice cream as being "only made from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, ice can also be produced without a stabiliser, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will bite on nothing but grains of ice.
Certain variations on the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that can be bought in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
'Suppliers will all try to get you dozens of flavoured supplements, 'he says.
'But you should just experiment, 'he said.
Either with the fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or for the ice cream made from the white base mass, which turns into a yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Students are now allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
The fruit ice cream varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - the taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mixture really brings out the flavour of a gelato, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a arithmetic task: If peach puree with lots of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winegrowers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make calculating easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic preparation of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small glitches do not go unnoticed.
Brazilian Gustavo splashes himself and his fellow students from top to bottom with fruit puree as the oversized hand blender gets out of control.
"In any course," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European Food Authority (Efsa) has been infiltrated by the industry experimenting with genetically modified crops.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief executive Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyists "association Ilsi for years.
It is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper played a key role in the Efsa testing requirements for GM crops and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, he said.
The Efsa regulations are paragraph by paragraph identical to the position papers of the Ilsi and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has complained of a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager recently joined the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or transition period - and thus switched sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), too, recently revealed personal links between the controlling EU authority and the industry lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians eager to hear.
However, Efsa does not see a conflict of interest.
All reputable data, including those from the industry, should be accessed as long as they are of high technical quality, it said in a statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not expected to have no contacts with the industry.
But they would have to disclose them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
On the subject, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently approved in animals without any feeding experiment, and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in the field," he says.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how are you going to find them?" he asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the USA, industry is now trying more and more in Europe to influence or discredit critical scientists.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left who are not intertwined with corporations.
As a rule, critical studies for companies would not be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of Stones
Uli Gsell has also bought some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station with the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: by September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to demolish a large section of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multi-billion dollar lowering of the station.
When construction was halted, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, used between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
'They mustn't disappear. '
He enthuses: 'A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy.'
When he saw one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the chunks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones has time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen established his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He has bought all the ones that came up during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to rubble or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden bunker that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when it was reported in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remnants of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he has been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing for the demolition.
And if it happens, then surely it would be the most sensible thing if the stones were to be reused.
Around 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the cuboids, which weigh an average of 80 kilos, with a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to give it back when it is rebuilt.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half are still stored in the forest, the rest have long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscaper, house builder.
They had come from everywhere and towed away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of offense have long since been transformed into "walls" or into boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
'Wouldn't be the political component. '
He gets into his SUV, takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
He carts his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the biggest stone dealer in the republic.
He brakes.
Artistically carved sandstones lie in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Marienbrücke in Dresden," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
"My favourite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The cuboids once belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart's Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones used to be cut by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes very awe-inspiring.
"It would be scandalous to shred something like that."
He has not become rich, certainly not very rich.
But the stone merchant employs 14 people today, as well as stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a horticulturist.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the remainder.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent battle for high potentials
There is a bustle at the buffet.
Sixteen students jostle for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are to talk together with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they enter the labour market and are wooed by others.
And because universities do not publish lists of their students "achievements, they try to identify and retain exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is courting the talents.
A young lady from the human resources department distributes pens, gummy bears and folders with the VW logo.
She tells the promising young talents about internships and student jobs and shows them their way into the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is in charge of the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can meet students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who could be considered as an employee."
Such collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
What is new, he said, is that students are being booed so aggressively.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for the newly graduated is likely to be even fiercer.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
Instead, they must promote themselves and, in particular, courtship for highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained unfilled in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even larger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta is on the hunt for talent for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events, such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to take part will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants is flying to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger in the fight for the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to work.
"We are still in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to join us soon," he says.
Apart from the direct booing on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also go on the prowl at trade fairs in the classic way.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"At Intersolar, for example," reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young talent.
There are currently 35 vacancies advertised on the company website.
'It's very difficult to fill vacancies at the moment. '
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give hints that you can do internships or write your diploma thesis with us."
Expensive promotions are not announced at the solar specialist.
The company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often cannot offer this," says HR Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays a major role in job hunting.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute draws up an annual ranking of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the general conditions for employees.
Human Resources Manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also lead to positive points for job seekers.
"I think applicants are particularly looking for external reviews of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mainly internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, this means internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within the own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, then they would naturally advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with a gang," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The administration in Washington has enacted a similar ban - and thus permanently revoked its earlier plans.
New drilling off the Atlantic coast will also be prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced the news on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April.
Before the accident, which killed 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters want to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been fully clarified.
At the centre of the criticism is British energy company BP, which is facing billions in claims.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is scheduled to deliver its findings later in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to avoid another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which had fallen into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing fundamental reform.
At the same time, Obama has announced plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that stricter regulation would significantly reduce production in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," according to a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO - ahead of Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burnt down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at a petrol station: Billions of litres of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil boiling.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't be fooled," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to his chest in the water with the stripes surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
There is no sign of brown swaths of crude oil floating beneath the surface.
She used to gather buckets of prawns here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggish flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil poured out of a burst pipe into the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
Driving through the mangrove swamps crisscrossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motor boat digs up brown broth, and anyone who dips their hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude out of the ground like black licorice sticks, sadly isolated palms let their fronds hang.
Swarms of birds, as is usually the case in wetlands, are sought in vain: as soon as the outboard engine is silent, eerie tranquillity spreads through the former paradise, which smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," Celestine Akpobari says darkly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a contested battlefield for decades: it was here that the first explorers from Europe arrived more than 60 years ago; it was here that the first resistance was organised in the 1980s, with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed; it was here that the Shell group was forced to cease production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is still barred from returning to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oilfields in Ogoniland lie idle, and the situation is too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames jut out of the water like bizarre sculptures: the heads of the boreholes are called "little Christmas trees."
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the marrow.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil trickles into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have flowed into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that leaked into the sea off Alaska when the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" crashed 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the ongoing eco-meltdown is a matter of dispute.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90% of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting wells and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
In 2008, US scientist Richard Steiner accused Shell of applying considerably lower safety standards in Nigeria than is usually the case in the world: the rate of pipe defects alone was "many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open air, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are naked and smeared with oil up to their necks.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to pipes and partly arbitrarily scattered on the premises, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, said Michael, the group's chief executive.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later kerosene and finally diesel trickle out at the end of the line.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel a day: "That earns us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal stoves can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that tap into the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost to the country every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the provisionally stored raw material is processed illegally: organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military figures, fill the lion's share in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the activities of the population or the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell has deteriorated to such an extent that only a withdrawal of the group would be considered: "Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
That's when Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who come mainly from the north of the country, also want to profit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has put our country on the line in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction flaw in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major safety problem.
Investigators investigating an emergency landing have discovered a possible construction fault that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas is now planning to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus, which made an emergency landing in early November, seem to have had a lot more luck than previously known: The Australian aviation safety authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 aircraft during its investigation - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: an oil hose connection could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
Engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft were affected.
They include the Qantas Airbus, which made an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of claim in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which would allow him to pursue further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine parts had come loose and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce blamed an oil fire for the damage.
Following the incident, up to 40 engines will now have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced they will carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos fitted with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety issue was deemed sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
The airline had kept its A380 fleet grounded for weeks after the Qantas plane made an emergency landing.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precaution.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Snow fell almost all over the country overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, with trains and flights cancelled.
At least three people have died in car crashes.
The winter is freezing in Germany: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic snows on Thursday night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are partly 15 centimetres of snow.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly blowing snow.
In addition, strong gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning onwards, with water levels 1.2 metres above normal.
In Saxony, the snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the meteorological centre Meteomedia, a purple alert was therefore announced in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Partly 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind caused congestion and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead wires and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony the long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were provided with blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snowy winds swept across the roads.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service was in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, nearly 400 camp beds were still available for them.
Accidents were reported on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a lorry driver was killed in a collision with a train at a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a lorry was caught on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after her car rolled over on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists do have some good news: the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore swirl up even with light gusts.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea is afflicted by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - down to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Twin Towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part ways with its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could fetch up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished its corporate headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recoup the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always consider whether it makes more sense to own or sell property and then rent it back," he said.
Thus Germany's largest credit institute already gives up its company headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the twin towers from investors in an in-house fund for 272 million euros in mid-2007 and then extensively refurbished them.
According to the data, the energy conversion cost around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed "Greentowers," at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead pal
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have paid tribute to the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft remains precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
Twenty-nine miners, ranging in age from 17 to 62, were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the crash shaft but had found no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue workers were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the boys.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
Twenty-nine tables were set up in honor of the buried miners, with helmets, lamps and the names of their comrades.
Pictures and personal belongings, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told those attending the memorial service.
'But they've never come home. '
He could not conclude with his son's death until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
Miners of British and South African origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases have been displaced, the blazing temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool down, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Does Splatter fit in with art cinema?
With his fighter epic "Valhalla Rising," director Nicolas Winding Refn is pushing old genre boundaries anew.
What audience was Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn thinking of when he shot "Valhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his enemies in sequence with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to resort to brutal killing methods and sometimes rips the intestines out of his enemies when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word throughout the film, and the other characters don't let themselves get carried away with one or two sentences or a few agonizing screams of death.
Otherwise, people will remain silent and indulge in the creepily beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
It's nice if a film has several target groups, but it's only a pity if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," but stoically refuses to make his works available to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema fans will be put off by the splashing brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when Einauge, for reasons that can be interpreted freely, sets off by ship with a troupe of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem and is stuck in the doldrums and fog for an eternity, before the team apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Valhalla Rising" did not find a cinema distributor in Germany and is now only available on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-soaked façade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it's all atmosphere, a feverish dream made into a film.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly allows him a moment of relaxation and slowly closes his throat with his icy images and the sinister trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that beats from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, faithful to one eye, maintains something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes the warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for the already corrupted.
"Valhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to the annoyance, excitement and amazement.

Mysterious earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates River; the nearest major city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents relating to the reactor that Syria claims to have built with the help of North Korea in the block, hidden in a valley that runs out of electricity.
According to a briefing by the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
The technology from the fifties, on the other hand, is hardly suitable for other purposes.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
Using computer animation, it revealed where the components of the reactor, which is a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear power plant, were before it was destroyed.
In addition, she submitted photos that show the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was close to commissioning, it said, but had not yet been stocked with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known more than then, in fact, the mysteries have grown larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, while the CIA was reasonably certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor at el-Kibar, it saw little evidence that the country had "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied succinctly over the summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
Syrians hastily pulled aside the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly leveled the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
Furthermore, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from one Member State in the immediate aftermath of the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed never to have operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA dismissed that as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Damascus has since refused to discuss it - as have the satellite images.
It also denies inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed-out building.
But Israel, too, has been steadfastly silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently reiterated the official position.
As a result, the investigation into the case has been dragging on since June 2008, and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna acknowledges - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are said to be "functionally connected" to the suspected reactor - and, unlike it, still exist - as key to advances in intelligence.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations they are dealing with, what their function is or what makes them suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and identified a Masyaf building complex from satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly adjacent to a military base, which is precisely why Syria denies the IAEA access to the three sites.
Vienna says the Syrians fear an expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
The nuclear detectives had been alerted to the facilities by a tip from the US secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was being transported between the three locations and the Euphrates River cuboid.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
But he said there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," such as uranium enrichment or reprocessing, processes needed to build nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor runs on non-enriched uranium.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from, there are only plausible guesses on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the debris has gone.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which Syria tested in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste repository, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks at the three suspicious sites and removed large containers after the IAEA demanded access.
This may be coincidence, but it has done little to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus also brushed off the suggestion.
Whereas a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna reassured us that the reactor had been destroyed and that the matter was therefore not of great urgency, US Ambassador Glyn Davies, for example, has been using so-called special inspections, one of the strictest means available to the Vienna Atomic Energy Authority to enforce controls, for the past few months.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this path: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What if they end up finding nothing at all?"
Love in times of war
There has been trouble ever since Angelina Jolie began working on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut in the summer.
She wrote the screenplay herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We don't know much more about it - but that alone is enough to cause a stir.
The rumour persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, whereupon some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but protests are still taking place in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organisation has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, according to the UN Refugee Agency, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
After some back-and-forth, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author herself asserts that she has no political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard to familiarise herself with the Yugoslavia conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and that she wants to give a voice to all parties involved.
The content, however, remains vague.
A second synopsis on the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is abducted to a Serb camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds very different from the variant "rape victim has a crush on a torturer."
That Jolie's film actually begins before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can bring her peace: by illegally putting the script online, as so many have done before.
Get Me Out Of Here
This evening, things are finally going really well for the Irish.
Not a trace of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans howl with joy at cracking loud music, they stamp their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is shaking as players throw ping-pong balls over a three-metre distance into beer mugs - and hit them.
"Beer Pong" is the name of the bizarre spectacle, with 500 Euros in prize money plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Beer Pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this flashy drinking game and the low-key computer scientist don't really go together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself, distracting himself from the nagging question of what the future holds.
His plan is not to play in Las Vegas, he will be in New Zealand in January for job interviews.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
'It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there. '
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had her dream job as an events manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect as many as 200,000 emigrants.
This is a huge loss for the small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts are correct, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of boom that brought great prosperity to the Irish, dreariness is once again taking hold.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom the only way to date has been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was plentiful.
But now three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
The Irish Times is awash with letters from young emigrants complaining: "Everything is going wrong in Ireland."
'There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but if you can, you'll leave and our country will lose a whole generation. '
"The last one will turn off the lights, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, sees a bleak future ahead because the government is "window dressing" and no longer offers prospects to young people.
"They are reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students shimmy from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest worry, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years.
'It's a sad and depressing thought. '
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to cast the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo," a trade show that offers an all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For young professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take their first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known for six months what it feels like to build something elsewhere.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction site in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are pulling up a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan now rarely sees his home, as he does extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with manicured front gardens, large, expensive cars are parked in the driveways.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loan-financed.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he worried that things might go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if it all goes wrong, I can start all over again."
The civil engineer does not like the wailing he often hears nowadays.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is nowhere near as dramatic as it used to be here on the island," he says.
'Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish. '
He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life in Ireland went on, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
Leave the future open and let's see how it goes with life elsewhere.
He has already had a couple of years of work in London and why shouldn't things be going well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that really worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just not too much emotion," he says, sipping a sip of his beer.
'Farewell, that sounds scary, doesn't it? '
'Let's call it a walk-away party, relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games. '
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the findings of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in the region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's survey, which was conducted in September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In numerous countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has grown considerably (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown at an annual rate of about 6% since 2002, the number of pro-democracy activists has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend is also evident in Mexico, where the economy is recovering from last year's sharp slump.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are staunch Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practices, the same number as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% trust their government, both of which are in line with last year's levels, but represent a significant increase from 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to promote democracy.
That this persisted even during the Great Depression may be because Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession and recovered quickly.
Moreover, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social safety net.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009, and fell again by 32% this year.)
But there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more pronounced and violent crime has increased.
For only the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Graph 5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member have been a victim of crime in the last year, but this is down from 38% last year, the lowest level since 1995.
Rising economic output is reflected in increased support for the private and market economy: around 71% of respondents nationally said that the private sector is indispensable for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelans have maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of private enterprise), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is nationalizing many private companies.
Brazil holds the most weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
By contrast, respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries see the US as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over the role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electoral flop
Nobody expected that the elections in Haiti on 28 November would be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election workers who rushed to the aid of the stricken country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom had been made homeless by January's earthquake, roamed the streets in search of choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some presumed front-runners, demanded that the election results be overturned because of alleged fraud.
Protests, some of them violent, broke out across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, the head of the U.N. mission in Haiti, called the election "pretty good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, supposedly beholden to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for Jan.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claims.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is declared the winner of the runoff by the electoral commission, it could cause problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, some 250,000 ID cards needed to vote had not yet been issued.
The stakes are high.
Donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after her husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her approval rating up 20 points to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
But whether that helps her win re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to steer economic policy after his wife was elected, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue as they pleased.
On paper, Fernandez's administration lost its congressional majority last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27 led to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists rallied behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one lawmaker punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss it," she said.
The 2010 budget now applies to next year as well, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money as she sees fit.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
Official inflation currently stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and labor unions "wage demands - put it at close to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, made growth and poverty eradication his main objectives, not lowering inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullied the private sector, and purged the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC), which subsequently glossed over official inflation statistics.
Can Fernandez now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and union leaders to hold talks.
And officials say pay rises will be capped at 18% next year.
High world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt with a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be why Cristina Fernández wants to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had opposed the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernandez appears to be pushing for a deal with the Paris Club backers, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always opposed a review by the IMF, as was customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step in cleaning up INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernandez will continue to be politically active after her term ends, even without her husband's support.
If so, it will need the support of the middle class, which has largely had enough of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been shown to them will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to quietly overturn many of her husband's policies.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly moving toward closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, turned out to vote for mayors and city councilors in the five boroughs, which is considered a broad evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By forging ground-breaking business ties, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself has become a symbol of mainland relations, and his policies have changed relations with mainland China for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not win a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, that would have posed problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city councils.
During the election, there were the usual occurrences in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass parades, and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the gunman wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Separately, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, there was no mention of relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
That is why the KMT does not like to prioritise its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP avoided stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment too much.
She was responding to a new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
For his part, Ma wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing is first and foremost.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians emerged, and the DPP is fighting for the votes of working people and youth.
Tsai, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen, was widely endorsed as the DPP's presidential candidate.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it, too, is capable of establishing close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to set up a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this will require unbiased discussions.
Tsai has said publicly that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's rash rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about the change.
From his cell, he said the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to relinquish his presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is struggling to choose its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
An KMT spokesman said he would reshape his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong stance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan has limited support for rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly named in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star on the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza," the nomination seems a little unusual, but it complies with Grammy rules that allow an artist to release no more than three albums before the album that made him a household name.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward, and with her exuberant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can easily be compared to Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success as a jazz performer in this category comes closest to Spalding's nomination.
In addition, the Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" was nominated in the instrumental album category, a critical favorite.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," won in the contemporary jazz category, which usually features albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ by wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the large group category. He thus competes against the Billy Childs Ensemble with its chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bass player as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is topped by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his fourth symphony, "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, ranging from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
This year, five artists were nominated in the classical music producer category - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the Instrumental Solo with Orchestra category.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I've used sounds from the Middle East and a lot of North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Temecula mosque wins planning committee approval
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and congestion.
But according to a statement from the commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
'As an American, that's what makes me proud. '
'It shows that justice's prevailing. '
"There are few opponents," he added.
'They're just very loud. '
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one comment read.
'It's another planet of apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand. '
'America's finished. '
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented with a water filter manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 large Mediterranean-style mosque is to have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 property on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could pave way for new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements previously thought to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it very special, even though it's almost a kind of 'alien' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But as the scientists discovered, the bacterium in California's Mono Lake continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You do wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar, a co-author of the report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must identify life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study looks at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planetary systems can use other elements to initiate biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a first because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic has a different effect to phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears virtually everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more abundant.
According to Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from the Early Earth Age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Remaining stolen show dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four show dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared Tuesday when unidentified people stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were staying outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
'They're in good condition. '
'They've been returned to their rightful owners. '
Whitmore did not provide details of where the dogs were found or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
'The investigation is ongoing, 'he said.
"We don't want to say any more about that," Whitmore said.
'We're tracking some tracks. '
The dog's owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unavailable for comment on Thursday.
They took their two dogs to a Downey County Animal Shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs in separate locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was scheduled to compete.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans in front of their room windows.
They took three other dogs - a boxer pup, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-set Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6am on Tuesday.
Peek promised a reward for anyone who could give a clue to the corgis, and the animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
It was not yet clear on Thursday whether a finder's wage would be paid.
The Lion Roars Again After Court Approval of MGM Restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to make a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially rubber-stamped a creditors "plan to pay down $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan complies with the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so nothing stands in the way of the reboot of MGM, headed by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will serve as chief executives of the slimmed-down studio.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to approx. 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not take effect until JPMorgan Chase completes a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
A consortium of the investment bank, which is itself contributing $75 million, is currently leading the company, with financing due by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring began in May 2009 with the appointment of investment bank Moelis & Co to help the company's management, which was struggling with interest payments of $300 million a year, solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial woes and pay out the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
But the auction attracted few bidders and none wanted to pay the $2bn demanded by creditors.
This spring, it all started afresh when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors at the end of October after months of debate and infighting.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The stake for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and has drawn up an annual schedule of seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to co-produce two films after "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial stake in the two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not yield a result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gadgets can rip a sizable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is equivalent to about 10 classic skipping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can conserve your gift budget.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club - in search of three electronics toys under $80.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although there are fewer new toys with their own website, the most popular of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer a wider range.
More and more button-cell-powered toys are coming onto the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children 3 and older) are plush figurines the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when pressed on their bellies.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, pressing several times can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you cannot stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children 2 and older) is the best choice.
Drawing on Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll interacts like 'Simon says', and thanks to its innovative wheel-locked hinged feet, it masters the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerised educational toys.
Now it's back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children 3 and older), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with an auto-correction feature as a teacher.
If you don't want to entrust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games it contains are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12), which has a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster range.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and ebooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there's Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children 8 and older), which is no bigger than a matchbox and has its own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together to form words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to toy stores alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix'N Match figurine pack ($5 for children 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two additional parts at the Club Penguin Store.
This could be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head-cell-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5 and older) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even stayed in our dog's mouth for some time.
Police deployments in China are softening
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin strode across a city square, checking on his nervous subordinates, issuing orders with military authority and a muffled voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and propensity for violence - to impress viewers.
'Straight up! '
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely out of their teens, wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood taut.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on her hair, which was held together with blue and white striped bows.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang notes contemptuously.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with staring: In 2009, 50 officers reportedly circled an improperly positioned food truck and stared at the operator until he packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a municipality in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the city's police patrols. They have been specially selected on the basis of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are intended to give the rough-and-tumble police a softer, more feminine aspect.
But alas, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, say the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city laws through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely paint a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a bystander to death when he filmed them using his cell phone to crush a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon merchant suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officers.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the internet shows officers trained in China attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan frightens the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough clean-up."
Skeptics say the current approach is clearly inadequate.
When the district advertised its search for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real jobs or were just a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good figures and "harmonious features" were sought.
They should be above average in size - about 5 feet, 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment ends on reaching the age of 26.
Officials say the job is too physically demanding for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first of all on their appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female chengguan are like vases of flowers," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the District City Council, does not agree with this description.
However, he admitted that size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon in China.
The same applies to even features.
Whether that equates to good looks is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame or humpbacks here," Mr. Zheng said.
'Her image wouldn't be good. '
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't find it sexist that so much emphasis was placed on her looks.
"Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "It's our job to represent the image of the city."
They say they have no regrets about the short-term hiring, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply chasing traders around the streets to stop them doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many sandwiches and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please disappear here."
"We have told you so many times!" Miss Xu explained to a trader who had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen, which was fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the civil servants, the job is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," says Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in her spare time.
'It's all routine. '
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate traders "goods, as their male counterparts do.
All they can do is threaten offenders with is report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from the public hostility to which officials in China are often subjected.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the overnight incident, and 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that had been repaired, contrary to regulations, on the pavement instead of in a workshop.
The owner yelled abuse and murder.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the grim-faced officers made their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind, flipping over his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like their female counterparts, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
'Sometimes we're verbal. '
"Sometimes physically," Mr. Li explains matter-of-factly.
"Most of the time people start arguing."
Prosecutor won't indict Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges brought against him after his affair with a former campaign aide and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision brings to an end the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible 2012 Republican presidential candidate until the scandal that made national headlines and dampened his career.
Senator Ensign's office said he was "delighted" with the verdict after a year-long investigation.
But the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they have been informed by the Justice Department that the investigation into Senator Ensign has been closed and that no further charges have been filed in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 led to speculation that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign aides, win lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during Ensign's election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he lobbied for them after Hampton was hired.
Because Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called revolving-door lobbying ban.
According to the published evidence, "it appears to be collusion and a violation of revolving-door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed very cautious about accepting political charges after a series of defeats that have been followed with great interest by the media, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the attorney general.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead defense attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day informing him that the department would not bring charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator had "acted in accordance with the law," his office said in a statement on Wednesday.
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Justice Department and myself, let's just say we believe we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop its investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group alleging that a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that has long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work with the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the firm promoted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "knocking on the door" of the Interior Department about a matter.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transportation Secretary to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after it hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When information about the affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth among Republicans.
After many months out of the limelight, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police inquiries, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and close its investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work serving the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped away in the riots in the courtroom.
Within minutes, they were tweeting their accounts of gruesome testimonies.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, will come to an official end when the judge hands down the death sentence handed down by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed motions in court setting out reasons for an appeal that will keep the courts busy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that intense coverage of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has created a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, immediate penetration of seditious details that the jury has been unduly influenced by public outrage.
That objection could prompt the appellate courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules in the courtroom necessary.
"As I have seen during this trial, I believe that there is a real danger when the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes "lead defense attorney.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of Appeals, issued a terse ruling last week rejecting the requests, saying that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court filings have found that coverage of notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, saying in its ruling that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court objections that look at Mr. Hayes's sentencing a half-century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of new media in trials that are watched by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be intrigued by the idea that restricting instant communication from the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many that Mr. Hayes's lawyers have set out to discuss for years, delaying a conviction.
Defense attorneys also contend, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test potential jurors "reactions by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with revulsion.
Defense lawyers say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge erroneously replaced a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to vacate the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of extensive coverage of the trial are perhaps the most interesting.
In a judgment challenge filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by candidates during the campaign for governor and U.S. Senate.
They argued that the new media had continually rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
"Such a daily crush of media beeps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has never been seen before in New Haven and perhaps nationwide."
Her emphasis on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more inflammatory than reports that are delivered more slowly is an anti-technology view that impoverishes coverage of future trials.
But some attorneys said appellate courts often face the argument that social and technical changes require adjustment by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers back up that claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction on the basis of reporting, and made clear that new rules were needed in the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness unite those who divide?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it an omen of genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders failed to produce a breakthrough on the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the session at the end of a government term in which no decisions are made.
From what we hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibilities to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan point-scoring.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the policy differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that masks the ideological divide that continues to divide members.
That is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has dawned.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - with one demanding signs of cooperation and compromise from the other, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and voters "patience after another partisan war.
As a result, Tuesday's meeting itself and its assessment by attendees were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health care or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election has softened Washington, at least for a short time.
"There's no question the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
'This is inevitable after elections, 'he said.
Elections reawaken partisan passions that are dying away.
And that's a good thing. '
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is advocating them.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits can be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that favored tax cuts for the rich while denying assistance to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, optimism has grown that these issues can be agreed during the lame duck session, while also ratifying the New START treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done are done, that short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and many share this skepticism - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from now until 2012 as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the makeup of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped educate them.
However concerned Republican leaders may be that they are playing poker too much, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and repeal health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, by their own estimation, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation, and they are struggling to even get close to that number.
The greatest resistance is to be found in the elected representatives of the body, because, on financial issues, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take the form of partisan clashes next year, when Republicans challenge Obama on the federal budget, taxes, and health care, followed later by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, a majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to an impasse, as it did in 1995, both parties must be careful about public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
That may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990 "s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and congressional Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
Viewed in this light, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy," which hands over to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the State Security Service extort large sums of protection money in order to maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes its share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that he has been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous defamation lawsuits against such allegations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian television station: 'It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty.'
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to surveys.
But it is unusual for individuals to be named, as happened in the Ambassador's report, and it is unheard of for a diplomat from a foreign country to do so.
"The Moscow government's direct link to crime has led some to call it" disturbed "and conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / mafias, which literally means" roof "or protection), which extends to the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Service Inspectorate (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
'Luzhkov is at the top of the list, 'he said.
"The FSB, the MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
'At the end of the day, ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors are at the bottom of the list, 'he said.
'This is an incompetent system where criminal groups are closing a gap in some areas because the city isn't offering any help. '
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources, and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
'That's why protection by criminal gangs is not as much in demand as it used to be. '
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - for one reason or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo includes descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases believed to be full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, said in a recent interview.
'But he's part of this bureaucracy. '
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, he estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the American Embassy memo, which occurred late in the evening Moscow time, is certain to arouse resentment within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that it is solving the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
'But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know. '
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with filthy and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the future Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian tribunal sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Veng, hampering their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
'It's dividing families. '
During Cambodia's Khmer Rouge rule, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot's government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their bases in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990 "s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who did not yield, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the Phnom Penh prison, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their arms, ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
'They grew up without any professional knowledge, 'he said.
Sor Lim, 55, who joined Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
'But now life's hard because we have to take care of ourselves. '
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will prosecute further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to assuage fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who served as district chief in Manteay province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
On a hot evening Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her Khmer Rouge past.
If the court subpoenaed her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court indicted more suspects, though experts and historians have debated this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer era means collecting the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's high school history book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
'They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be convicted by the court. '
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are gradually gaining influence, "he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful appeal here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and filthy with plastic garbage leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been cremated on a heap of tyres here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned.
"But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she would lay a bush of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to stop stockpiling weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article from the Security Summit.
The US government had spent years trying to persuade Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium, and appeared to have hit a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret deals were struck with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about £500, according to an official who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the key outcomes of Obama's "47-nation Nuclear Security Summit" in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was evidently good enough to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (in 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons grade, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus moved closer to the US a few months ago when it expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily contaminated, officials say.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and carried out by plane, according to officials.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going to Belarusian research into low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable), adding that the former deputy prime minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "in order to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe denouncing complicity in human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega met.
The deputy prime minister admitted that the council's report "had Zapatero on the sidelines" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide on the matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "caught off guard," Aguirre said by cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, even though the government has little leverage, since it is in the hands of the judges."
For his part, the prosecutor Vicente González informed the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense concerning the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to ensure discretion between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a luncheon in March 2007 attended by the US ambassador and the Spanish interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely committed to their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his staff "to avoid pompous rhetorical comments in order to defuse the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience tells us that the PP will not doubt that the Zapatero government will capitalize on an indication that the US government has tolerated or willfully ignored actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations may have a negative impact on the US government," he said.
The child killer admits she has complained about the 'hardship' of motherhood on the internet.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki."
With this epithet, which she uses from an early age, she maintains contact with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand them, one needs to know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
It lasted a year.
Shortly after breaking up their relationship, it was revealed she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his wife never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she embarked on another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Cesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But the contents of their messages suggest their romance broke down and they parted ways.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he thought it was good, but now of course he realises what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free to do what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she has just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mum, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I am going there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job if I do not want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
"He will be with the one he needs to be with, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention considering their poor relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes them, it is assumed that the boy, who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
'On the one hand Cesar is happy, on the other hand he's not. '
'On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day. '
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
'He (the boy) will go to summer school there, so I'll have less expenses for the nanny. '
On the 17th: Memories and lamentations.
"A huge kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he finds me, such crap."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is doing well. He is going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
Of Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now blocked, in which she called herself "Muki, the prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (headline)."
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting warden, says he has remorse because he feels guilty.
He can't believe it all happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Palma Provincial Prison.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the course of events "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Earlier, however, she had confessed to having drowned Cesar in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
The defence and prosecution requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking ahead to the parliamentary elections - early or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party gets in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, compared with only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the PSC redirecting its vote share and retaining PP voters - continues, PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen in the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia to the PP and PSOE.
According to the Popular Party's analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could keep its MP or gain one more.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date for municipal elections will be May 2011, when the Popular Party (PP) will be able to hold the balance to put an end to socialist domination in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the Popular Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists have neither a majority nor traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not inconceivable that this party will lose its representation on the Barcelona City Council, where it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, increased its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona's turnaround, where they had ruled with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
The People's Party also recorded significant growth in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell supplied Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police from the Barcelona Police Intelligence Unit were part of a jihadist cell based in Thailand that supplied passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LTTE) - the latter behind the bombings in Bombay that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, going so far as to assure that "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus worldwide, and thus "its ability to act."
According to the researchers, in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation. It cannot be excluded that there will be attacks similar to the one carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday on the territory of the EU in the coming days.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had headed the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole passports from tourists in accordance with the instructions of the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This meant that the documents had to be issued in the names of men between 25 and 45 years of age and still valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigators stress that no link has yet been established between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, despite the fact that the author of the attack, Lashkar e-Taiba, was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack, several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia by means of a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commando" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone tax deal
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas her conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are no different from those made during the election campaign and can be summed up by the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party addressed Artur Mas with the assurance that the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure more than enough to make her feel indispensable, since the candidate from the bourgeois regionalist party CiU relies on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain in the vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to form in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As for the leader of the PPC, she calls for "all discourse on the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial settlement between the state and the autonomous region - similar to that in the Basque Country - which the leader of the CiU even wants to subject to a referendum, to be put on the back burner in support of the inauguration.
What both leaders have in common is that they want to streamline the bloated political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat from the PPC are discussing the details of the negotiations on Mas's inauguration.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home insists the deaths were not the result of a "lack of action"
Owners of a nursing home in Olot do not rule out that their carer killed more than 11 elderly people
The leaders of the care home for the elderly La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they highlighted the damage done to the institution by the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmés - the carer who killed at least eleven elderly people in his care during his work.
The director of the care home for the elderly, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to indict the person responsible (for the deaths)," but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and the civil liability."
Not only does the institution suffer a loss of social standing because it failed to detect the criminal activities of the carer in good time, but it now also has to pay a large amount of compensation, calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were handled by telephone because of their age and illnesses.
The head of La Caritat flatly denied this point, saying that "the lack of action at the time may have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer for La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the litigation of negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
The man, who had already been baptised the day before yesterday as the "angel of death," confessed to eleven murders and claimed to have committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and to have murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said staff's access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin injections and the sedative cocktail in six of the nine crimes committed to relieve the patients of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will reveal whether Vila lied and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from within by administering bleach to them, as he confessed to having done to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, the testimony of the caretaker is not believed, not even in terms of the number of murders confessed, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had given very different testimony in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course of action after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
Risk premiums in the euro-peripheral countries have risen dramatically, and European banks "shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be wrong and that the euro has barely gained points, which is worrying.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers as it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
Institutional investors are far from losing their fear.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably many more times in the future, the ECB will have to backtrack.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase government debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the suspension of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond-buying programme to continue and send a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets will be set back, and if we stubbornly insist that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reiterated that it would not consider buying sovereign debt and markets subsequently collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
She showed her teeth in May and on Wednesday said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market meltdown.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government securities in Portugal was quite weak.
The State Asset Management spent only $500 million at 5.28%, compared with $750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nonetheless, interest rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a shift in market perceptions, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt hole figures from Allied and Bank of Ireland were released.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and a possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has lost all credibility after failing to identify the problem with the July stress tests, the numbers under the bailout plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must win parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday. Ireland remains a source of uncertainty as it still lacks sufficient support.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse ahead of the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that together we are playing the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The President of the Spanish Government yesterday presented the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as well as in the financial institutions, reduction of the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound to investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The twin effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of Europe.
Compared to February, the response from the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are banking on strong demand that will dispel any doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in keeping with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now it is not just being that counts, but appearances too."
Only courage, we can do it!
The CEO of Owls challenges the shareholder meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the companies Owls and El Enebro, did not subside.
David Álvarez, founder of the business guru, will challenge the shareholders "meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it" absolutely null and void. "His children will try to obtain a majority in order to control the governing bodies of the company - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing legal action for a new chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group.
The founder of El Enebro, the largest holding company for business services, seems unwilling to give way in his legal battle for control of El Enebro's institutions.
He was ousted from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves as members of the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The Shareholders "Meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has set off a new thunderclap in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Referring to the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the general meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the annulled assembly of 18 January recognized by means of legal sophistry, deception and abuse of rights," according to official spokesmen.
This argument is the basis for the retrospective challenge of the Assembly to declare it "absolutely null and void."
The same protagonists, who shroud themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene an assembly by judicial means.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to the Family Protocols, the founder of the services group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
That is the background to the case on which the judge will have to decide in the hearing on the contested action, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Ever since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, their history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and, despite his soaring career over the last few seasons, everyone relied on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferraris in the final sprint last November.
Without wishing to diminish the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens placed in Red Bull's hands, creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to motor racing.
This informatics program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens "industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in the Red Bull Formula 1 factory," in a few hours, almost in real time, "he can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected during races and tests.
Russwurm points out that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Red Bull's team today employs 180 highly qualified young people, who use powerful computer systems to carry out analyses and make all sorts of changes to the race cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault claims sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula One team is allowed to spend on its races in a single season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory to develop and manufacture its racing cars in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - particularly by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two drivers, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the service of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago it was still possible to say that advances in racing car R & D accounted for 50 per cent of the victory and that the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed, with technology accounting for 85 per cent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 per cent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computerised because they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP to open 20 of its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a twenty-store network of 80 to 100 square meters that the multinational plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company has agreed this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales divisions, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España vice-president Helena Herrero cited as an example the converted shop on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American group intends to open 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 in Spain.
The first were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera would not reveal the new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The Vice Chair, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the store opening philosophy is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group will advise them and take over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products at your fingertips). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of store staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and stressed that the aim of the exclusive network of points of sale was to "optimise after-sales service and advice to small and micro-enterprises on purchasing and thereafter, even on packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been designed in particular for small and micro-enterprises and private customers, as large companies already have their technical service contracts," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell aims to 'steal' one million customers from rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nonetheless, it foresees a slump in interest margins, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million residential customers in three years - a field still to be filled.
Sabadell has found a way to exhaust the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without recourse to public aid from the FROB, but also to increase its market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you take away the customers that the bank will lose - which is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250,000 retail customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, and reduce costs. The Bank will present the challenges it faces together with its annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has thrown banks "plans into disarray.
Sabadell will complete its Optima Guideline, which was established four years ago, this year. Initially, it was designed for three years, but due to market conditions, it has been extended by one year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
Speaking at a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola said 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach."
The manager believes Spain is only coming out of the crisis "slowly."
It would also be "very difficult" to "create jobs" in two or three years "time - essential to the banks" survival.
Even if he assumes that the war over liabilities - which penalizes interest-rate margins - will subside, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks must pay for their issuance to maintain liquidity are already being passed on to the price of loans to compensate for shrinking margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on credit."
"We didn't turn off the tap, but the interest differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order to its network of branches on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that banks are currently pursuing the option of "increasing fees," but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadell's mission statement is based on organic growth, although the group, as always, does not rule out corporate deals.
It is not for nothing that he asserts that "larger companies are needed in Spain."
"Everything will change next year," he says.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "growing enormously" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into the red.
He believes the FROB can replace the money market when it comes to capital increases.
After asserting that Sabadell could survive even a temporary market shutdown, he invalidates the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be circulated, but in contrast to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo transactions, thereby mitigating the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers between savings banks
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a wave of mergers between savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase, reserving the second round for themselves.
On the other hand, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the majority of the mergers have been completed, and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be regarded as a second round, but rather as adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes have already been completed, and they have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timeliness that was established in the past, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which is why we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said there were "a number of strong opinions about the slowness of the process, the seriousness and the absurdity" because "Banco de España urges us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, adding that those who doubted it were doing so "without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that in the current economic climate, "we do not have to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" process of concentration, which will be carried out "as quickly as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and Germany's Red Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but at the same time laid down conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the removal of the 426 euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for provoking the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
Let's face it, Merkel's position is no fault of her public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is adopting a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the preservation of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
Faced with resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second is the re-introduction of the Deutschmark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - with the support of a large proportion of public opinion, around 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a restructuring of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishing countries that exceed the targets; possibly suspending some countries' payments; and extending the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created deficit incentives, and the German government crafted constitutional reform to prevent this from happening from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany saw as necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The Central European country sent the second signal when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to bail out Greece.
This was heavily criticised at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public opinion and public opinion were absolutely against bailing out Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel once again came out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow a country to be bailed out while obliging private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it fuelled the Irish crisis and all that followed.
However, its proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been accepted and in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will cease to exist after that date.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area, in which the infringing countries will be severely punished, may be forced to default and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is showing us that we must embark on a tough course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on indebtedness and construction with huge balance-of-payments holes, as spearheaded by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit down to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do in these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will be calmed down.
And that we will make use of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood this, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after last Saturday's meeting with big business and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order at home has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like that will change.
One of the possibilities being considered is that we would have to leave the euro area, which is crammed with unreliable countries.
In that case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to evade a penalty.
The exclusion allegedly instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being poured on whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee fined the club's coach, Jose Mourinho, two games and the players involved different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that are followed in the sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen around the case stems from the fact that a team from the Real Madrid football club (which pretends to be noble and honorable in its anthem and on other occasions has punished its players for similar incidents) played the leading role in it, and from the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added one episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate centres on whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contravenes the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a circumvention of the rules. In fact, this approach complies with the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the spirit of sport should be investigated.
The sportsmanship defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not jeopardized by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking unjustified advantage of the opposition team, and that did not happen either.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand as cheating or rule evasion, because the evasion of the rule was not carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of benefit the offenders derived from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was not placed in an unfavorable position nor were advantages demanded for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's not a useful strategy for the next game because the club doesn't have those players.
The obvious advantage is that the players enter the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage that is uncertain to a certain extent, as the team may also be eliminated at some point. Furthermore, by doing this, players receive a sanction and move on to the second card cycle, where they are eliminated for accumulating one card less than in the first cycle.
It is therefore not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
At the end of the day, such practices do not go against the spirit of sport, which includes strategic decisions to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent any sanction (in fact, this would be a clear case of rule circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the way the rules were transmitted.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Customer Catching Offer Offensive for Group Christmas Dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar is causing an avalanche of reservations this year on December 16 and 17.
The celebrations, paid for by employees themselves, are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are group dinners in the run-up to Christmas that provide oxygen to Barcelona's catering and leisure industry, but, as a result of the economic crisis, they are triggering a price offensive to capture the mass customer segment: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, according to the entrepreneurs and associations surveyed.
To make things a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders for the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many workers pay for it out of their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, it calls for the lowest prices, confirms Gaietà Farràs, President of the Barcelona Catering Board.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare to predict so far what the holidays will look like this month.
'People think twice before making a reservation, 'he said.
"They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
Business will be good for those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices by 25 euros are the most in demand.
A survey of several centrally located restaurants shows that the evening of 17 December leads to the collapse of the suppliers.
The Soteras group says demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros is booming, and the group has adapted its menus with all-inclusive offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
For another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible in order to maintain last year's prices with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 eateries, is not losing any optimism after revenues started to blossom again in the second quarter and is looking forward to a good outlook for the Christmas business, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Group sources point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and, in return, want more details, such as cava.
In some companies, too, green shoots can be seen sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again, giving the impression that group dinners are on the rise again.
On the part of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that overall reservations are quite "lively," although customers "are pushing to the max."
But the fun of partying hasn't diminished, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's Nuclear Program Raises Major Concern in U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Revelations by WikiLeaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the WikiLeaks website, confirms the enormous concerns that Washington has about Pakistan's nuclear programme.
On the fringes of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of North American accredited diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not increasing, but on the contrary is "declining," and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but that their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - is giving Washington sleepless nights.
The risks listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area under attack by the Taliban, the presumed dispersion of nuclear material, and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered excessive and a reason for caution, not only by the US, but also by Russia.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly religious personnel to guard its nuclear facilities; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
What is new about the documentary, revealed by Julian Assange's website, is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is waning, and the accelerated pace at which Pakistan is making nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communications with Pakistan as "frustrating" said: "Often there is no transparency; we receive no response to offers of aid or they are rejected."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a State Intelligence Service official for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons more rapidly than any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clarify" to the commander-in-chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, during a visit that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a top counter-terrorism official to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red alert for tracking and locating Assange.
Everything connected with WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and prosecute" Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Furthermore, it is not new, it dates from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the sexual abuse allegations facing the Australian in Sweden.
The lawyer for the WikiLeaks founder, Mark Stephens, also asserts that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not made public until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had obtained the authority.
That's the way things are, with Interpol's 188 countries instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to arrest and extradite him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual subject to a red alert, many member countries, according to the organization, view the red alert as carte blanche for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be staying.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who released a letter informing them that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder is willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied to leave Sweden and was granted permission by the prosecutor, who has been compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security for Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal pursuit," the letter says.
While the world searches for him - and his mother, from Australia, proclaims her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave a Skype interview to Time magazine's editor-in-chief from an unspecified location, during which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties signed by the US, she should resign," he said.
His comments were condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for his resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, with preventing new leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to pay less attention to Assange is at odds with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of adding WikiLeaks to the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went further, saying Assange should be "assassinated."
'Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something, 'he said.
The person who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is too lenient a punishment," he told broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to those close to Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on whether he stays in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and an end to the principle of plenary assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for avoiding for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after losing 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party leader is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the sector's influence is now as weak as its mentor and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra, with a wink, is trying to win over the new critics, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that ERC's 200-plus regional councillors could vote in secret on whether to remain in office.
With ballot papers, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to punish the president, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division as well as submission to himself.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he did not feel vindicated with half the votes plus one, and added, without giving percentages, that a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod are demanding more from the president than just giving his office to the party, an insufficient gesture since Puigcercós controls the supreme body of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which the leadership will submit to the Council for its vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós, in return for a promise to bring the Congress forward to autumn 2011, which party leaders already regard as a fact.
The leader of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is damaging stability and he wants once and for all to enable the organisation to do its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the incumbent congressman Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for various objectives."
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party's members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's circle.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the assembly principle as a way of working.
Thus he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcercós "team, which has fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the trembling 2008 meeting, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of assembly at a congress devoted to reforming the statutes.
That date has yet to be set, given the internal turmoil of recent years.
Now, without the critical sectors lying in wait, the time may have come to take up the matter again and close it down forever.
23 killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO count, there have been four fewer cases in Mexico than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO Mexico count.
Among those killed are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were a total of 390 deaths, presumably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm-related bullets, the gunshot was fired at his head and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the Mixtecas street in the community of Santa Cruz Acatlán in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday the 4th, early in the morning, farm workers found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal bullets in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway on the section that crosses the town of Villa Guerrero.
A message believed to have been signed by the Michoacan criminal organization La Familia was found next to the body.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times after leaving his home to work as a garbage truck driver.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds died after being shot in the head in the community of San Pedro Xaloxtoc in the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with a bullet wound to his forehead was found on a lonely path in the village of El Naranjo, with a cartridge shell fired from a .calibre firearm under the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the settlement of Playa Golondrina.
Emergency services searched for the remaining body parts but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the Peña Colorada area, with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads bound.
The man had a wound that stemmed from a firearm shot in the neck.
In the middle of the month, it was reported that two men were murdered, wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two death threats were also found.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the community of Valle de los Reyes in the community of Los Reyes La Paz.
At a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a note signed by El Incorro.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the community of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket was found, probably Mario Ríos, according to the message left by his killers.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with bullets in the neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with corresponding images were discovered on the woman's skin.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle in the municipality of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with duct tape and a note were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organisation, which read: "This is happening to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two handcuffed bodies with signs of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín community.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been decapitated in the community of Cuchilla Ancon and wrapped in black plastic bags, with a message next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the community of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The Chinese official said at COP16 that his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and that it would maintain its offer to cut 40-45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, asserts Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei asserted that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He said that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new energy law that includes targets for reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the state authorities had cooperated with those of the central and local authorities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, some multi-annual plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he was referring to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place for the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change in that country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than is commonly believed.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, compared to 100 tons in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent in the last five years and another one is planned by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espino: Cesar Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Pan Party leader had the right to go to the National Commission of Order and demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, asserted that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was justified and that the former leader of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Commission of Order and demand what the law granted him.
In an interview that preceded Gabino Cué Monteagudo's complaint as governor of the state, he said Espino's exclusion was a decision made at the local level.
'It's an independent decision by the Sonoran Police Commission. '
"In his case, Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said, it's not time to think about 2012, and that an alliance with the presidential candidates has never sat around the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, when his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the municipal elections, it was successful and served its purpose," he said.
The panicked leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary," we enjoy it and it strengthens us, "he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best chairperson (s) that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the relay "to whoever the Council would choose."
"I am completely unconcerned and open about this. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party leader."
He predicted that the party's upturn in the last election, on July 4, would be reflected in the next elections, though "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is a question of supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this regard, he emphasized that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla, and Sinaloa will carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino is up to the challenge."
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his four-year rule, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year tenure of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the Federal Government can make expressions like the ones he makes in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no prohibition of mouth and even less censorship.
Obama takes to Twitter to defend law in favor of undocumented students
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for passage of this bill," the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - legislation to legalize undocumented students - with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for passage of this bill," Obama tweeted.
His memo includes a cyberlink to a larger document that urges the public to get in touch with their senators immediately, as the bill's vote is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he says.
The news came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block any vote on any bill except expand Bush-era tax breaks and expand government funding.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of the New START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Asked about Republicans blocking the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable could be set for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest of the process," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that "he would request a vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to vote in the Senate starting next Thursday, though next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in this country for the last five years, and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the bill's proponents need sixty votes to pass, so they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, advocacy organizations are organizing an intensive effort to influence the law's passage.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, hold 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That's why defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who came out in favor of the bill, John McCain, has not yet set out his position.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Pleasure of Language' was a walk in which participants made a strong case for the narrative
"I understand the sex in language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "gets us into trouble," the Argentine writer spat sweetly at the audience, made up mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz later characterized as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who seeks to find out what a "wound" is, going from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but hints for the direction of her narrative.
She confidently leaves the infectologist: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating encounter with the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that the wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs with relief and concludes that she "only learnt from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the pleasure in language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful tale, which he called 'Praise of Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells the story of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back well-travelled men, or restored the virtue lost by a maiden; the story turned around and told of America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack its own chroniclers; and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), scoffed at the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost its sense of shame."
He stresses, however, that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and that is where reality and lies converge, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
Indeed, he calls it the 'Cervantes tradition'.
'We inherited from him to be what we're told. '
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIL's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggles over drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentional commitment," she said, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the reader as if in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer."
He noted that in a fast-paced world, even intellectual habits and consciousness control boil down to dogmatism, forgetting that "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and of reality, we must be nuanced: and nuance often means putting our finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing those in power who prefer to divide the world into black and white," he observed, inviting us to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
The final duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey also pitted two different styles dictated by their respective coaches, and their contrasting encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had crucial games and so far he has held up well, so this opportunity is very important for him.
The Argentine has become the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and, amazingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santo strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hands, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to suffer another setback, as the game ended with a 2-2 draw against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but with the penalty he made it 3-1 and got two chances to win the title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with his great rival Monterrey. Therefore, he does not want to be haunted by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for the affection I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing," he said when asked about the finals he lost.
He still remembers the last final match very much, he says he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee doesn't whistle the end, we can't celebrate, we on the line are prepared, the players are too, because the last time we were prepared to retire with two penalties, and I think that is a lesson, until the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, you want to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate caused us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or a fierce desire to hold the title in our hands, that left us something for this final and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso's power to stop being just a second champion and taste the glory that comes with titles for the first time.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
People will have to present themselves to the visa application services before going to the consulate, thus reducing waiting times.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for visas at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves to the Visa Application Services (ASC) before being interviewed at the consulate.
The ASC staff collects the biometric data of the applicant, which is checked by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases because it is no longer necessary to pay separately for making an appointment, processing the visa application and the transport service with which the document is issued.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors.
Those who only wish to renew their visa do not need to go to the consulate, they only need to go to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is collected at the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment at the consulate will have less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service charge of 26 dollars.

NASA Announces Finding of Extraterrestrial Life
The North American space agency called a press conference to announce a find tomorrow that will have implications for the search for life in space.
Tomorrow, Thursday, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA's Washington headquarters by experts in astrobiology, a science that examines the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA said it would present "a compelling find for the search for alien life," prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could support the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments previously thought uninhabitable, raising the hypothesis that they could transform into intelligent creatures - just like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that has been deemed too toxic to any form of life, as the lake is high in arsenic.
In one way or another, the microbial uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances increase that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually another life form, a second life form, which differs from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its find at a press conference tomorrow (Thursday).
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon) to see if its chemical composition is similar to Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
Reform of the Congressional organ law would usher in a two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent, had already established itself, and the four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the inaugural session of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo railed against the reform of the organ law, arguing that it would exclude them.
This reform, they repeated, would introduce a 'two-party system' because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau, headed by the panicist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally established their political marginalization with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to change the scheme, assuming that they had the political will, and if they did not, they would be subjugated again by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"This is where I come from (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they don't even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said that there was agreement with the PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there should be an eternal two-party system in Congress," he said.
"For starters, this group starts with five deputies and they talk to other deputies to get more," he said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to the PAN and PRI, said that the Congress had now turned into a 'booty' for two.
'It used to be just one party, now they're splitting it up into two. '
Patrón Montalvo requested that the Members of Parliament be respected and that they be given their place at the negotiating tables.
'Five, which will probably be nine MEPs, must not be left out because of top decisions, the five, who are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we do not agree with this reform. '
200 000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán is paying another cheque to the controversial owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the municipality.
This brings the total amount paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the Municipal Transparency page, this cheque for an amount of 200,144.56 pesos, numbered 9258447, was issued on 16 November last for the purpose of "settling outstanding invoices."
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already anticipated that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier, who is being watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it is selling at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and, consequently, the number of cheques that will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last one from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law when a company is questioned by ASE in order to prevent other administrations from requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on 25 July the audit of the cheques issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that already earlier, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she cashed checks worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist destinations need to be urgently improved
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay particular attention to areas in poor condition and which have a bad image of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Merchants of the Dorada Zone, recalled that, on various occasions, there have been calls for the destination to be maintained and for the poor conditions that tourists find to be transformed into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and pavements had had a negative impact as tourists came to stroll and saw the disorder, prompting them to turn their backs on nearby shops.
"The politicians do not know what it means to have to close a company one day and they do not worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not carry out the construction work slowly and haphazardly in this way."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall drew attention to the city's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The community needs to take its responsibility and avoid this happening again. How should it do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of retrofitting everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eager to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, but we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city government needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and its tourist attractions in good shape," he added.
'Not enough attention has been paid to these precautions, and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to all: there's an urgent need for maintenance. '
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, said that it was important to save the tourist resorts of Mazatlán because they were not used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that need to be refurbished together with the city. Priority should be given to making the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and refurbished in order to make them attractive for tourism and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that parliamentarians should take the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business community is calling for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th parliament was inaugurated, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN deputies, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and another from PVEM, making a total of 40 elected representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to be committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the Business Coordination Council (CCE), suggested that the new deputies should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act freely of collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to reach agreements with which they defend their own interests, turning them into carnival extras of the ruling party and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, that they work for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, says that one of the great challenges facing the 40 elected representatives of the people is to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, stimulate investment and create infrastructure, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary status in the state budget to promote it.
"I understand that it is the ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfil these wishes on the next Epiphany, because the household consists of no more than twelve people and a male goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so crave.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because their father has no steady job.
"Sometimes times are tough because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... I go out with the brats to sell in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes the size of one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would love this monster so much,' but I said, 'Let's wait and see, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
Clothes and shoes would be ideal for the older children who were at school.
Eleven-year-old Maria Guadalupe is a size 12; ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can take part in the 'Holy King is wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
Around ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, at locations which are believed to have been mainly used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used in the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are believed to be the main ringleaders of the drug ring from Sherbrooke.
The people arrested are said to have appeared outside the courthouse in Sherbrooke just hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with producing cannabis, possessing it for sale, conspiracy and providing services to crime.
The searches followed a lengthy investigation that lasted more than a year.
"The information we have received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Mr Ruel said.
About 70 officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Clandestine immigration could be easily tracked
The Conservative bill, which the government says will address the problem of boats loaded with secret migrants, is likely to be scrapped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I stand with a party that has shackled you," Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff told the assembled lawmakers after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which would allow the detention for up to a year of any person identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian constitution of law and freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it targeted the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does," Mr. Duceppe said.
Criticism over the immigration issue by the NDP's Olivia Chow has brushed off critics who say her party is not steadfast enough on illegal immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the stowaways, and that's what we're trying to do through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames the refugees and holds children captive for at least a year, "Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of toying with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
'Canadians are emphatically telling MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, this criminal activity that affects Canada and that treats the country like a doormat. '
"They expect Canada to take tough action," Mr. Kennedy said.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law, which could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, one Conservative told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately declare himself or herself to his or her constituents.
The new entity does not find unanimity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the possible creation of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry into the issue.
Robert Dutil, the Minister of Public Security, maintains that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Still, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not even discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it without reason that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described the announcement as a "rabbit out of a hat" in terms of public safety and a "crafted solution at the end of the table."
For his part, Minister Dutil had once again addressed those who fear that political power has too much influence over the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he said.
'They're aware of the problem. '
According to Réjean Parent, president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign," said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (National College for the Training of Senior Administrators).
In order to break this impasse, he proposes that Quebec give financial auditors a specific mandate to investigate corruption and collusion.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he said.
He also argues that Quebec could give audit control the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to force people to testify.
The creation of a standing entity is not the only project in the Charest government's drawers.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal code to make it more responsive to this type of crime.
This request comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of prosecution is ambiguous.
For his part, Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Safety, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which concerned motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested, although the penal code was not amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under tight guard due to heavy rainfall that has been pouring down in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, in the Mauricie region, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preemptively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in the process.
Heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 millilitres fell on several regions from Tuesday to Wednesday evening.
Between 20 and 40 more millimetres of precipitation were expected here by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
Areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were worst affected.
A total of up to 100 millimetres of rain had fallen here.
Since this precipitation is accompanied by the melting of snow, which has already accumulated in certain areas, it is feared that several watercourses may be crossed.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued flood alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood control and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon to be flooded.
In Saint-Calixte, a passing bridge was torn away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security services remain on high alert and are closely monitoring the situation, said security official Annik Bouchard.
For its part, Quebec's National Flood Centre issued warnings on Wednesday about the sharp rise of several rivers, particularly Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reprimanded
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) over his controversial comments about social welfare and Haitians, as well as his expletive-ridden speech on radio.
The CCNR argues that although Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their views, certain statements "contain inaccurate information about social care and unjustified negative portrayals of Haitians, as well as such crude language that is inappropriate for daytime broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the distribution of the names of two persons who have committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first order was lodged following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec."
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences in question of the broadcast" Dupont le midi "would have touched on a sensitive subject in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
As a result, he was not reprimanded at all.
The last point of contention concerned the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had engaged in an argument in the media, which had provoked a great deal of reaction.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated to the Haiti relief effort, since it was not known for certain whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presented an unjustifiably negative portrayal of Haitians.
'I've already served my three-day suspension sentence in this case. '
'My act has been a virgin for a year and a half, 'the presenter explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of crude language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM announcer had acted "beyond his obligations."
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, should have communicated its decisions once during prime time within a period of three days, are negligible.
King of kung fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has chosen a very particular course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact kung-fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now stepping up to the tatami and boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 in order to develop himself among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground combat as presented by the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare. "
Recently, the security officer and UPS employee gave bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
"I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"Those fighters from every category who placed in the top four at the last World Championships were invited."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009," he said.
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"I finished fifth in China in 2007, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
'It's worth noting that I've progressed in every competition. '
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which punches and kicks as well as throwing the floor are permitted.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer to emerge from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain just one event in his career, he would surely call his presence at the Super Bowl "King of Sanda," the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," said the likeable Pound.
'It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's biggest stadium). '
'It's been a great experience. '
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will confront each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has approved by mutual agreement USD 450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a corollary to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over to the private sector its responsibility for this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to business consortia is a serious ethical problem, which creates the risk of suppression of competition and an increase in prices.
'This is a new way of playing the game and it's debilitating for the competition. '
"This means that instead of colluding games, we are now conducting them in an open form, rather than in a secret way," Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, told a press conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because he found it difficult to understand how the public interest could be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that the contract was a set-up.
"I stand by my line," she railed, asserting that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and that it "lacked toughness."
She said it was "the very least" that the PQ should apologise.
The consortium model is common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in bidding for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scale of work.
The construction process is under way and should be in place by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without competition; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, even with relatively simple projects, the Quebec consortium model is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir noted last week, the consortium's model for civil engineering and consulting is the subject of a government investigation.
A brief flyover of the Quebec Register of Companies allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which appear to be of steady duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, such as CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, can be traced back to the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay is subject to a particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the major employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has raised eyebrows over the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are few applicants, your prices will skyrocket."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are in this market and say to yourself: a satisfactory deal will be negotiated at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that matters, but the expertise of the individuals," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After a review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Énergie gérance."
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They amount to a total of $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the Parti libéral du Québec are well known.
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally connected to the companies that "financed" it, before specifying that they were its executives.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
Quebec consumers have little confidence in the main players in sustainable growth, but equally little confidence in the labeled brands or the eco-labels that are supposed to guide their choices.
It is a pity, even though it is bathed in a media universe that is full of information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has to lament a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that can be seen as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they boosted consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to have little credit for those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admits that they don't believe in companies "environmental commitment, just as they don't believe in green corporate advertising, according to the measurement tool devised by Sherbrooke University's responsible consumer center.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
Following the same pattern, only 14.6% of Quebec's population takes politicians "discourse on the issue seriously.
Nonetheless, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently enlivened by nearly one-third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Furthermore, a third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, 61% of the respondents had also preferred to buy from distributors in their neighbourhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - this year's eco-conscious consumption index was 64 out of a maximum of 100 - Quebec's Homo consuus likes to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its environmental footprint by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to stop at the car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers said they used public transportation or preferred the ride-sharing center in 2010 to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of respondents to the comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds into stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent belonging to Daniel Langlois, in order to return it to its proper cinematic function, are apparently not getting what they asked for.
The government has agreed to get involved, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a loan of less than the initial hoped-for amount, which could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to sources familiar with the government's rumor mill.
An initial action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the request has since been revised downwards.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet's counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond.
In any case, the premise of government spending really does seem to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of cinema owners and complexes had rebelled against direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there that he had not given to other cinemas.
Several other market players in the segment, on the other hand, sought substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the auteur cinema in the premises of his cinema complex with great difficulty for over ten years, which could justify the exceptional position of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is abundantly evident in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to keep its clientele on side.
Société Angus and the company Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are heading for a privately financed campaign, which they hope to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of Xavier Beauvois "highly successful film" Des hommes et des dieux. "
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not removed the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the proposals that have been made to them, which have been revised downwards.
Mystery of shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic cables disseminated by WikiLeaks unravel the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans, but at the same time expose the latter's sense of superiority over Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when voting, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were circulated publicly yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantive content to nibble on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, indicates the point at which the United Nations ceases to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers several explanations for this situation.
"An inferiority complex that is almost intrinsic to Canadians may make Canadian political leaders talk about everyday domestic issues much more than pass the buck to the United States in this election (as in the 1988 free-trade campaign)," he writes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too menacing to speak of."
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries have intense political and economic ties.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship, which the voter has in mind as a key factor at the ballot box."
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Her trip will help ensure the government's survival in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade as a result of a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus program," Breese said.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are spreading from the United States.
The Ambassador is disturbed by programmes such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even diversions for the purposes of CIA interrogations.
Another memo details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner, at their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe was willing to accept certain Guantanamo detainees.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he handed the secretary of state a paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
'The Secretary of State has promised to review the dossier again, 'he said.
Finally, tempers are heating up over the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a senior adviser close to Stephen Harper, had told CBC that those responsible for the massive leak should be "killed."
He was referring here to Mike Huckabee of the United States.
Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew lighting in homes, commerce and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (CFCs), equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted to the earth from lighting if the incandescent bulbs, which still have a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better yet, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases in the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, a further 5 Gt would have to be deducted from this balance in order to stabilise the 2 ° C rise in climate between now and 2020, in order to prevent it from spiralling out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
Compact fluorescent bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, while the new LED bulbs reduce this energy requirement by a factor of two.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - this company, incidentally, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an indication of the potential savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also function with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless producers provide a collection point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power stations, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25.000 tonnes of mercury a year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year buying electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants that would cost Indonesia $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of Ivory Coast's presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN chief.
"It asks all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had missed the deadline of midnight on Wednesday, three days after Sunday's election, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were repeated calls from all over the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo, who is leaving office, and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the Constitutional Council to annul "fraudulent" votes in the north obtained by the ex-Forces nouvelles (FN) rebel camp during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of Ivory Coast's presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN's attempts to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo's complaints are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, opponents of Gbagbo now believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, described the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking publication of the results because he knows he lost, and lodging a complaint with the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
Sunday's second round of presidential elections were seen as the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible in the event of any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France stable in third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (ILO), the unemployment rate in France in the metropolis is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), as shown by the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
Unemployment in the metropolis stands at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter represented 9.3% of the working age population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
More closely, 3.4 million people in the French metropolis were unemployed in the third quarter, but wanted to find work, including whether or not they were available every two weeks or whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
According to the IAA, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the third quarter.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), or 482,000 over-50s, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only those aged 25-49 benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to use this method, announcing on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments), compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), was investigated and sent to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of corporate assets, embezzlement of public goods, theft, complicity in corruption, unlawful bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him, instead of spreading fantasies."
"It's easy to accuse him of a number of criminal charges, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) ahead of his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first member of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the department, had made a point of sending the judge, through his lawyers, a memoradum of justification before his hearing.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
He would never have known about the business area or the destination of the funds involved, Mr Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne agglomeration, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but then released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
'My client has been able to clarify the facts he's been accused of. '
"The lead prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from custody on Tuesday night, including two under judicial supervision, said Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unlawful interference and passive bribery."
Two public servants from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one for "evasion and embezzlement of public property by a public servant," and the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds."
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "stealing and embezzlement of company assets."
Among the people who have been compared to Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar case of public-sector fraud that had affected Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company helped launder money from "high-level" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste disposal sector, is being conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Sources close to the investigation indicate that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions under which the contract was awarded and the operation of a landfill site in La Ciotat, which also receives waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its role as mediator for Syria
For more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage," captivated the French public, put diplomacy on high alert, and accentuated the deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by Le Monde reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give them advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not entail the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and wanted by the American judiciary for trafficking in material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they shine a bright light on the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to make them believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing of the sort.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Handling of Hostages."
François Richier, Elysée strategic adviser, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do their utmost to repatriate their own nationals who were being held by force in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and incessantly" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
'Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it, 'he said.
Because "silence solves nothing," past the attempts at discussion of inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters of evasive manoeuvres."
Mr Richier adds that arresting foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "taking hostages for political extortion."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was supposed to take place on 16 August, the day on which she took refuge in the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (EUR 230,000 bail).
And he says the Elysée is anticipating more hostage-taking, a phenomenon that is "going to get worse."
Iranians "could arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
One piece of information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from custody following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is tracking Iran's illicit networks for the acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted horse-trading?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On September 4, François Richier reassures Kathleen Allegrone that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings in Paris run by the Iranian Embassy."
While Clotilde Reiss is in custody in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make people believe, through statements and "escape attempts" organised by the media, that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential mediating role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony, noting that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities."
What is the basis for so much "thanksgiving" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then examines the reasons that led the Elysée to succumb to this fiction.
The intensive communications efforts "are aimed at reaffirming Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008 that was "perceived as premature and undeserved by many critics in France and abroad."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris "is trying to show Syria what rewards can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
It also aims to "sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from good sources.
On August 11, François Richier confided to her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
'But we've still thanked them. '
"This should at least create confusion for the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes them to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in securing the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella" that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A bill to require online gaming operators to deny access to these games to under-16s after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of education and family ministries said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to safeguard their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, minister in charge of the draft law, told Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6am.
Manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government would also consider asking manufacturers to lower the daily time limit for accessing these games to those youngsters whose parents request it, the official added.
He will also make free programmes available to those who wish to do so, which will make it possible to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
Amid a flurry of corruption allegations, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday named the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which wrangling for influence and lobbying threaten to eclipse technical criteria.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA's supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic, with the International Football Federation hoping to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the African continent's premiere in 2010, or to continue its presence in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to continue until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the forefront of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), might as well have ruined the chances of their own country, the cradle of football, hosting the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by airing a documentary that blasted three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have been lobbying in the first place with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The Prime Minister is hoping for a repeat of the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who managed to organise the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would that intense effort be enough to restore England's image in front of the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries "economic and financial downsides could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, are increasing the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the blunt allusion to accusations in the English press of "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" by committee members.
'You throw dirt on them, you try to compromise them, 'Putin ranted.
The United States, buoyed by the 1994 experience, seem the logical favourites for 2022.
First economic world power, seat of the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately put together a very nice project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that helped organize the 2002 contests.
Another threat: FIFA's eagerly awaited 2026 World Cup bid for China, rendering Asia's chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar pulling out all the stops to build futuristic stadiums, FIFA is looking to expand into new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the perceived weakness of television rights (owing to the time difference), the sensitive nerve of FIFA, acknowledged by European countries.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really cut back.
Mitterand had led us to believe that he would fall.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less so than this.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be an ergo candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not sit well with the side of the mystery inherent in the presidency.
So we have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense as well as another.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third mandate was not out of the question, without even believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy affirmed in earnest that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011."
That he would raise the prospect of "two seats" in the Elysée on Tuesday night in front of UMP parliamentarians had spread a little feverish.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"You have at worst another seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the period after that."
His words the day before yesterday do not make him a candidate any more than they did the day before; but neither do they make him any less.
If they provoke comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012 that many in the PS are urging him to challenge sooner than expected.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, voters on the right would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," the prime minister's immediate and cautious reaction was.
"If he thought defeat was possible, he would not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned himself to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB's Governing Council last year was supposed to be an opportunity to show ways out of the crisis, or at least to announce the ordering of a large number of unconventional monetary-policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt can certainly not afford to forfeit the current, more than tense situation in the European bond markets, so as not to cause their aggravation.
The political cost would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in resolving Europe's public debt.
It did not say whether it thought the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its program of government bond purchases.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very eloquent about his intentions the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would "continue" and that at Thursday's meeting "we will see what the decisions are."
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled its bond purchases last week to about €1.35 billion.
And, according to leaks from some traders, yesterday it was said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases amounting to 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among traders about the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price (see page 29).
Economists do not expect a remarkable change in course any time soon.
If more than three months "worth of bond purchases have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be generously tapping into unrestricted cash reserves, for a period from one week to three months.
Economists are already bracing themselves for this measure to extend for a few more months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially modify its programme."
"Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," suggests Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bond purchases that stimulates the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must come to the rescue of the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent premature enthusiasm about the yields paid to the weakest sovereigns," a major bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, governments would be prevented even more from reducing, or even stabilizing, their debt.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
Berlusconi's government takes cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased somewhat yesterday with the fall in benchmark interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the president of the region, Giulio Tremonti, described the situation as "indecipherable" and said he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
At any rate, on Tuesday, the gap in German interest rates had reached a record 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts covering the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, causing some confusion in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the gap between Spain and German interest rates is 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "gravely concerned" by the "market turmoil" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
To put it bluntly, its problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying dwindling tax revenues that put the state in danger of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the Government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget under consideration by the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that next year's budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP (against the government's forecast of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar over a new collective budget that could be set aside after the holidays to the tune of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are in order, and we have been repeating this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.), is being asked to make less progress towards stabilisation than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
That leaves the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to the holding of early elections as early as the end of March.
There is therefore an unfavourable period ahead for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think we proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are unequivocally united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although entirely relative, yesterday's deduction in the interest rates on European government bonds was water on the windmills of governments and the ECB.
However, there is still no sign of a start to normalization.
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's had said it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, arguably the most effective target for speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility weighing heavily on banking systems," said economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political period is much slower than that of the markets."
European countries, aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their counterparts at the G20, are progressing well.
This is also in view of the Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the fate of the unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday in order to inform investors in the Far East about developments concerning the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
The first issues of advertising paper from the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilized by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the countries in the front line, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that come on top of austerity measures but are expected to have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path from that taken by Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, it is important for both parties to avoid having to ask for international assistance before drawing up their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on unavoidable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to go back into its own pocket.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, say an extension of around €100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being scrutinised closely in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are deteriorating.
Snow and icy conditions: 24 departments on orange alert
The episodes of snow are still causing traffic problems, particularly on Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the threat of snow and icy conditions.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already on orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snow showers affect the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows lightly on the et Ile-de-France.
Snow cover of 2 to 5 cm is expected in the affected departments, in places also 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic disruption and disrupt certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy goods vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation on Brittany's secondary transport networks is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using your vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "urges motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines on Thursday to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Roissy airport in Paris and 10% from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Billions have been rained since the debate on modernising the transport sector in Ile-de-France was in full swing.
At least in the discussions.
Consider in particular the $23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of SGP, the state has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend on the markets a portion of the sum of money at twice its value.
Today, the first projections have finally been made.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this money.
The measures are twofold: the creation of a special tax on development and higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
The figure is as follows: "The product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a reorganisation of the existing corporate taxation system: "to modernise it, to increase the product resulting from it and to entrust this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that bring?
A conundrum.
This sum is not stated in the text.
We are a long way from the 4 billion.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital envelope raised by the state, which will gradually be paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment the revenue is recorded (the two taxes, that is), it is possible to cover the project for three years and then only draw on the 4 billion," it explains.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that in 2013 it will begin to write down the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose promised 4 billion will be searchable for a long time to come, runs the risk of provoking quite a lively parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vindictive hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a dual meaning.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is nothing more than a sine qua non hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the regressive future.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every file produced by an intelligence service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw up nothing more than what could be read in any magazine for months anyway (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gadhafi's shockingly caricatured profile has long been the stuff of cabaret artists "skits.
The rule that secret files should consist only of news that is already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will see that each work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosaries) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's mechanism for success.
Likewise the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made about the revelations in these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of State or Government can call each other or take an aeroplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few minor representational tasks, have become spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy to pretend to ignore it.
Still, repeating it publicly violates the mission of hypocrisy and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Moreover, the scandal is less about the victims and more about the "executioners."
But let's look at the profound nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's day, all power could be pooled like Big Brother controlling every gesture of its subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where every movement can be controlled thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway chosen, and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold on if it is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
True, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is essentially a secret free from secrecy, since it exposes the public sphere; but to reveal, WikiLeaks-style, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to deprive her of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a formidable power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will not put any reserved information online - that would be like putting up a notice on a street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has travelled on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and only for certain ears relationships be maintained in the future?
I know full well that my prediction sounds like science fiction and fiction at the moment, but I am compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in secret ways along uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere else but in their bare memory, and, moreover, concealing the little written information they have received in the shoe heel.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate espionage effort had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, by rewinding from back to front and unraveling all the secrets of the montage, whereas nowadays the (numerical) CDs allow nothing else but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
High-speed trains run from Rome to Milan in three hours, while air travel, including transfers, takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to revert to cars and horses.
One final observation.
In former times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that are demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is whitewashing its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the fast-track delivery of financing promises (also known as "fast start" or premature financing) made by developing countries.
And already the rude French gossip has been revealed.
With the Copenhagen Accord, developing countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, while France has promised €1.26 billion (or €420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress reports from its Member States, press conferences, major side events, distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU claims to have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money, according to the Copenhagen Treaty, should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional commitment was made without prejudice to Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
Whereas the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark they think is the best.
The European Commission, for example, has chosen 2009 as its benchmark: international financing will be maintained, adding 150 million over three years as part of the "Fast Start" financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at ODA level.
In return, France said that financing for "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the previous year's expenditure or for ODA at global level.
Specifically, the total amount of French assistance to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to honour its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses their arithmetic mode.
Some, such as France, have €1 borrowed as the equivalent of €1 donated.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often carbon-mitigation projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro collected as the equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the donor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to see for itself.
France is the only EU country to use loans on a large scale.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are fulfilling their obligations with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents, which is a comparable amount of money.
Beautiful hocus pocus!
All in all, France is operating with a double fraud in its Fast Start financing: partly by developing the action over time and partly by the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter on premature financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to all the discussions about the climate.
But it may be the straw that breaks the camel's back in the UNFCCC's vast machinery.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Be that as it may, it is vital to learn the lessons of this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting practices for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could advance discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another crucial issue currently under discussion): it cannot escape the issue of "creditability" or the accounting of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues as it is on other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "accountability" and the use of loans would by its very nature raise the international confidence needed for further discussion.
Alarm - pesticides used by children
A child of 10 years of age consumes 81 different chemical substances during the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which says that its results "do not represent a statistically significant value given the small number of samples analysed, but illustrate the nature of the problem being treated," had purchased between July and September the food usually consumed with meals by a child of about ten years of age, plus a snack, from supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five pieces of fresh fruit and fruit, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined, as were sweets from laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is staggering: 81 chemicals, including 42 substances classified as possibly or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded in the approximate majority of cases, it is clear from this survey that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factors is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three that have been proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
The minced steak, the canned tuna, even the baguette and the chewing gum were also riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the case of tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest," with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not uncontaminated.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this "toxic cocktail" is "likely to be underestimated," the study said.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, "in view of the urgency of the situation," to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in diseases affecting civilisation."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues identified 365 different pesticides in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
