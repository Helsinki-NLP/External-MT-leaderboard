Welsh MAs are concerned about 'similarities'
Some MPs expressed concern over the idea that their name should be MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The case arose from a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs in the political world are worried that it could bring ridicule.
A Labour MP said he was concerned his group would "fit in with TWP and PWP".
For readers outside Wales, TWP in Welsh means foolish and PWP means foolish.
A Plaid AM said the group was "not happy" overall and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh radical said his group had "a receptive mind" about the name change, but it was a short word leap from MWP to MPET.
In this context, the Welsh W is the same as the English U in Yorkshire.
The council commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce similar changes, stated: "The final decision on any clarification of what the council members are called is, in fact, the members' own".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, a proposal to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament published the results of a public consultation which received widespread support.
As for the naming of MPs, the Commission chose the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the option of MWP received the overwhelming support in public consultation.
MPs are clearly offering alternatives, but reaching a consensus could be a headache for the current chairwoman, Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit the amended bill in weeks.
The amendments include rules on dismissal of MPs and the formulation of the committee system, including other changes to the way the assembly operates.
The M's will have the final say on who should be called when debating the law.
Macedonians vote to change their country's name in a referendum
On Sunday, voters will vote to name their country the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held to resolve decades of disagreement with neighboring Greece over its own state, Macedonia.
Athens has repeatedly rejected its longtime northern neighbor's bid to become a member of the EU and NATO, saying the name suggests a claim to its territory.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the name change, said he would not pay attention to the election.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is a simple fee to become a member of the EU and NATO.
During the struggle in Harlem churches, the bells of St. Martin's were silently rung
"The old people I spoke to in the story were coffee shops and churches on every corner", Mr. Adam said.
"none of them today".
The loss of coffee beans is understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
"Coffee bars are no longer the local salon houses where people go regularly.
In the case of the churches, the leaders fear that the money from the sale of property will not be much, "and they are soon back where they started too late".
They added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with communal houses where the rest of the local shrines are not understood.
"Most of the people who buy the communal housing in this area will be white", he said, "and so we will hasten the closing date of these churches from now on because it is not expected that most people who come to these communal housing will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black community: in 1870, the town's community, St. Martin's, was incorporated a decade later.
The main white methodist conference was in the 1930s.
A recent Black Council took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin was seized by the Black Council under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike against merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who were hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson and the congregation planned to rebuild, they built a musical instrument in the basement.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the instrument "the bells of the poor".
The instrument was described by experts who played it last July as something else: "cultural treasure" and "historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a graduate of the University of Michigan, also played the world's first solo instrument, played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church's large ballad orchestra 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Meriwether, St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex tale of architects and contractors, some by the church leaders and others by the bishop of the diocese.
The Treasurer - the governing body of the preacher based on the leaders of the church - although the Treasurer is not involved in the process of hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese, in July the diocese wrote that it "wants to spend the expenses on the Treasurer".
Some parishioners complain about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy who was swimming to catch lobsters in California was injured by a whale
A 13-year-old boy who was swimming to catch a lobster at the opening of the lobster season in California on Saturday was injured in a shootout, officials said.
The damage occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near the Bacon Beach in Insinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard his son screaming for help and he and his team cried to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hamel initially thought it was a pleasure to catch a lobster, but he explained that "he understood that it was screaming, 'I've been bitten!'"
'I have touched you!'
The whole bracket was opened, Hamel said, and they noticed this as soon as they arrived with his son.
"I have called out loudly for everyone to get out of the water. 'There is a shake in the water!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted from the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The cause of the accident is not known.
Life-saving cat Larry Gills told media that a whale had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a dangerous species.
Gilles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamish in Insinitas for 48 hours for testing and security purposes.
Gilles said there are more than 135 species of whales in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty markets
With the professional support of Sainsbury's staff, it has a large store-style collection of boots, supermarkets and Debenhams's cosmetics shelves arranged in different sections.
As part of a £2.8 billion push into the UK market that continues to grow as fashion and domestic sales decline, the biggest beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets once saved shelf space for TVs, heaters and furniture.
Sainsbury's said it will double its beauty products, including brands such as Revlon, Ec, Twizerman and Dr.R, to 3,000 products.
Current products, starting with Aurail, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, are getting more branded slots, similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also restart the boutique's makeup range to make it more suitable for vegetarian-only products, which is highly sought after by most young consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrans is testing discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second is due to open later this year in Sale Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and buying small amounts of food every day in convenient locations means supermarkets should do more to attract people to visit them.
In an attempt to compete with Aldi and Lidl, who offer more services and non-food products, the supermarket chain's retail outlets are highly organized into different departments, according to Sensbury CEO Mike Coupe.
Sainsbury's has installed Argon outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced several residential properties that have boosted grocery sales and made its holdings more profitable since it bought both chains two years ago.
The supermarket has previously tried to renovate it with a large store organized into different sections of beauty and pharmacies, but failed.
Sainsbury's had tried to start with boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship was broken by disagreements over how to divide the proceeds from the grocery stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy to Celsio, owner of the Lloyd's chain of pharmacies, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyd will play a role in the plan by expanding luxury skincare brands, including brands such as Laroche-Possai and Vinci, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in colleagues who are specially trained and ready to provide advice.
The brands we have are tailored to each individual's needs and the convenient environment and location means we are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old fashioned consumer".
Peter Jones 'was very angry' after leaving Holly Willoughby's £11m deal
"Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, is 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from her £11 million deal with the lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willogby has no time for them, Truly, for their furniture and accessories.
The trade of the bones was linked to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand of Gup.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is dating.
Holly Willoughby angers Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her luxury lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was 'very angry' at a stressful meeting at the business kingdom's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the golden TV personality said her new contract would cost up to £1.5 million and that she would no longer have time to sell their furniture and accessories brand Truly.
The business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Gup brand and suggested it had doubled Willoughby's wealth by around £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced her departure from Truly on Instagram, Jones went to one of Britain's Jet Resort.
According to a source, "Truli Holi was one of the top priorities.
It was her long term future career, which she would spend the next decade.
Her decision to step down has absolutely shocked all those involved in the case.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to starting.
The warehouse at the main office in Marlowe City is full of ready-to-sell goods.
The Morning Post is one of Britain's leading banking experts, and experts believe that his release will cost the company millions of dollars from the brass to the candles and even the home furnishings, and will delay his further successful journey.
As a result, the long-standing partnership may end.
Willoghey, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have a decade-long relationship with John and his wife Tara Kapp.
Wilogie further strengthened her relationship with CAP in 2016, and John, 52, became chairman in March.
The Caples Holiday Together and Jones have a 40% stake in Baldwin TV Productions.
Willoghey will be the brand ambassador for MS, replacing Ant MacPartlin, who is the host of MTV AME Solidarity.
Sources close to Jones said yesterday evening that they "did not want to comment on his business".
after an amazing conversation, we both fell in love.
He mocked the criticism from the media for some of his unexpected comments from the president and positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so pissed?
Trump joked, "this is the voice of the new news reader".
 and i will not give up anything.
He said Kim was happy with the second meeting, which was a better way to make North Korea a nuclear-free country than the one that was first held in Singapore in June and hosted by Trump.
But the nuclear nonproliferation treaty has been stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, has met with world leaders at the United Nations, three months after the June meeting in Singapore, where the General Assembly said the North had failed to heed the "proportionate response" to the U.S. offer of arms cuts to North Korea.
He said that the US continued to impose sanctions with the intention of influencing us.
Trump has taken positive points from his lengthy speech.
"We are in good communication with North Korea", he said.
It was leading us to war with North Korea in the past.
millions of people could have died.
We have now established good relations.
He said that their efforts to improve their relationship with Kim have had positive results, including the launching of rockets.
When asked about their unusual relationship with Kim, they disagreed.
Trump said it was easier to be president than to have 10,000 people in a crowded hall, and now there are about 200 people in the hall, he pointed out to the crowd in front of him.
hundreds of people have died in the tsunami and earthquake in indonesia.
Following the Lom Bok earthquake, it was stated that there was no need for assistance from non-governmental organizations in foreign countries.
Although 10 percent of the population of Lom Bok has been displaced, no national disaster has been reported.
Ms Sambeng said: "Unfortunately, in many cases, international aid is not requested, which is very difficult.
When Save the Children organized a team to travel to Palo, it was not possible to be sure that there would be a possibility for foreign experts to come and work on the site.
National Disaster Agency spokesperson, Mr. Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities in Palu were looking into the possibility of international agencies coming to the scene and working.
Indonesia has been unfortunately vulnerable to this earthquake, as it has been at various times.
Although tents were set up in large numbers following the tsunami, there are few on other beaches.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, although not having much impact, played a major role in the deaths.
In Indonesia, it was not easy to travel from one island to another even in the days of peace.
Natural disasters complicate logistics further.
The ship at the Lom Bok hospital was on its way to help the victims in Palu, but it would take at least 3 days to reach Palu.
President Joko Widodo has promised to work on improving Indonesia's infrastructure during his election campaign, spending a lot of money on roads and railway infrastructure.
But the lack of funded individuals has been prevented from hindering the administration of Mr. Jacon in the elections next year.
Mr. Joko is under further pressure, with the overwhelming number of Muslims becoming conservative.
In the street clashes between Christian and Muslim mafias, more than 1,000 people were killed and 10,000 displaced, the mafias used sticks, bows and other tools for fighting.

The Cromwell Parliament Monument is a good historical monument.
What is meant to be done is justice for the many British cultural and religious gifts that were undeserved and destroyed by the Taliban and given to the Persians.
The Chromewell community describes the idea of Mrs. Crick as a quirk and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Gold Smith, the Cromwell community's collector, said the current dispute is aimed at removing the statue of Oliver Comwell standing outside the Palace of Westminster.
The English Civil War, which many disagree with, was neither ordered nor orchestrated by Cromwell.
The weakness of Chromewell is that it pays a price for the works of Thomas, his predecessor.
Sir william ham's description of cromwell is a 19th century proof of concept and history, and has led many to still hold him in high regard.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was respected by many, especially in the 19th century, more than he is now, for resisting outside pressure in Parliament, especially from the royal family.
The historical debate over the exact formulation of the matter is ongoing.
Of course, the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the future development of our country, and Cromwell is a notable figure who represents one aspect of that division.
The achievements are celebrated and remembered as a king on his throne.
The killer pig fatally injured a Chinese farmer.
Local media reported that a farmer was attacked by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The Morning Post in southern China reported on Sunday that Yuan was found bleeding and dead in a market in the province of Guizhou, Liupanshu.
In Zheng Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, the farmer, the owner of the pig, was preparing to inject the pig with a vaccine.
He and his nephew had brought 15 pigs from the Yuan province to market last Friday.
The next morning, the cousin was found dead, the door to the neighboring pigsty was reported to be unlocked.
He said that the mouth of the biggest pig was covered with blood.
Forensic examination has confirmed that a 550-pound pig was the cause of the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin Agru was bleeding and injured. " The victim was named 'Wu' as reported by Guliang Evening News.
Yuan entered the market to feed the pigs at 4.40 am on Thursday, according to footage left by security cameras.
The body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not identified as Yuan's or his cousin's son.
A police officer told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent harm to other people, adding that the police were gathering information.
Yuan's family and market officials are in talks about the amount of compensation to be paid to the deceased.
Although occasional cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
10 years ago, a 650 lb. pig from a Welsh farmer was threatened by his owner and held in a cage with the tractor until he was driven away.
A Minotoban farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but blood sensation can be "exciting" until a Oregon farmer is eaten by the pigs in 2012.
"it is their game.
They are like a child, they ask so much...they are not out to hurt you.
You just have to give the right respect, he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy, heavy rains to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels over the cold coastal waters of northern Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern US.
Rosa had a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 85 miles per hour, as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to travel north.
Meanwhile, a calm tidal wave is forming and moving eastward along the US west coast, with Rosa forming a tropical storm on Monday and moving northward toward the southwest US as it approaches Beja California.
Rosa will bring a partial 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will meet the incoming dew and cause heavy rainfall to spread to the southwest in the next few days.
Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches in the area can cause dangerous flooding, mudslides and landslides in desert areas.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected, especially in most parts of Arizona.
The scattered rainfall nature of tropical rainfall can lead to a rapidly decreasing flood.
It is not very wise to walk into the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains turn valleys into powerful rivers, and thunderstorms bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The approaching typhoon will bring some local rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Over half an inch of rainfall can cause moderate slippery and slippery roads.
This may be the first rain of the local wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona around Sunday night and Monday morning before the rains begin to spread into Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread from Tuesday to Wednesday in all four corners.
As the Arctic cools, there may be some strong temperature swings across the US in October, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this causes unexpected changes in temperature over short distances.
A major example of unexpected temperature variations is in the central US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The summer heat will try to re-establish itself and spread over the next few days.
Most of the central and eastern US is expected to have a warm start to October, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees, extending from the southern plains to the northeastern part.
New York City is expected to experience 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that the eastern US is likely to experience warmer than average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched the spectacular testimony on Sex TV networks of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political protests continue as broadcasters cancel their regular programming for Wednesday's last-minute change, a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a weeklong investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure she was drunk and robbed of her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanagh said in his emotional testimony that he was 100% sure that nothing happened.
It is estimated that over 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen said in the report.
The company was counting the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network and MSNBC.
The number of other networks that have shown it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nielsen often has some difficulty measuring people who see office.
To put that into a certain perspective, the size of the audience is the same as the size of a deciding football game or an Academy Award.
The Fox News Channel, which strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a daylong hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
After the victory, the demand continued at the highest level.
Flake was the central figure in the Saturday drama.
After the liberal Republican office announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning screaming at protesters as they tried to arrest him to go to the Justice Committee hearing.
They stood with their necks to the ground for long minutes during the protest, CNN reported live.
One woman said, "I'm standing in front of you".
Do they think they are telling the truth to the country?
"Many women have no power, but you have power", it is said.
Flake said the office has issued a statement and may say more during the committee hearing before the elevator closes.
When the Justice Committee voted for Kavanagh's nomination for the full Senate, cable and broadcast networks all provided live coverage.
But Flake said he could only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see the charges against the candidate next week, as a few Democrats were pushing.
Flake admitted in part after speaking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with the Queens and several senators, Flake announced his decision.
Flake has the option because Republicans are not likely to get the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh outside the test.
President Trump opens FBI investigation into Kavanagh allegations.
British Prime Minister May Hayes accused of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper said the Haitian government was "playing politics" by treating her plan to leave the EU as a violation of British interests and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham, UK for the Conservative Party conference on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which continued the front page of the paper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked their Brexit plan, dubbed the Chequers Plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their own tariffs was "completely absurd".
Wade Sims shot, police arrest Dayton Simpson, suspected of the LSU player's disappearance.
Police arrest suspected of shooting dead 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of second degree murder, the Beton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video showing a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the beating.
Police removed the glasses from the scene of the beating and said they found Simpson's sperm on them, CBS affiliate WFB reported.
police believe that after interrogating simpson, weed was shot to death.
The bond is $350,000, TheAdvocate reports.
The East Bethenburg Preacher Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a Christmas bullet to the neck.
The department said the Lusanian State Police, the Special Forces, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local citizens contributed to the arrest of the suspect.
"LCU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement for his courage and his efforts to bring justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Beton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LCU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 assists per game last season.
LCU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "deeply hurt" and "in shock" by Wade's rescue.
"This is what you always worry about", said Wade.
A volcano spews ash in mexico city
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reach the southern residential areas of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans to stay away from the area after the volcano began activity in the crater on Saturday, reporting 183 gas emissions in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several severe shocks and tremors.
Images from social media showed ash covering car covers in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Zochimil.
Geophysicists have detected activity on the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan protesters ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with police in Adama on Saturday, and thousands joined in protests against the anniversary of the Catalan independence election.
In a strike covered with eggs and thrown in paint powder, masked separatist groups held by police created a thick cloud of dust on the streets, which are often crowded with tourists.
There was a fight later in the day and the police used sticks to stop the fight.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while those in favor of unity chanted "May Spain live forever".
According to local newspaper, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries.
After the referendum of 1 October was declared illegal in Madrid and was observed by the protesters, tensions in the pro-independence area continued to escalate.
The voters voted for the independence in a large way, although the number of people who protested against the annexation was low.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes across the region last year when police stopped voting at polling stations.
Freedom groups spent the night outside to prevent a rally in support of the National Police on Friday.
The protest was held but took a different direction.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the protest along with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
"last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents reading with joy because they could vote, but now we stopped", he said.
Although they achieved a narrow and useful victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have found it difficult to maintain the zeal that most of their prominent leaders have either been persecuted themselves or imprisoned while awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Mechanic Juan Puig, 42, who was recording the demonstration in support of the police, said the clash was triggered by politicians on both sides.
"There is more stress", he explained.
Oriol Juancueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"We have seen from the Spanish government that participating in the European elections as a candidate helps to observe and understand the pressures that come with the violation of democratic values", he said.
Londonderry: A man arrested after a home was hit by a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested in Londonderry after a car repeatedly hit a house.
The incident was reported at around 19:30 British time on Thursday in Ballinagaard Crescent.
DET Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the entrance gate and the building.
It is estimated that a bow may have been fired at a part of the car.
The attack by the herd led to a 1-0 victory for Livingstone over Rangers.
The first goal of the Dolly Pack ensures the victory of Livingstone.
Growing up, Living Stone surprised Rangers by signing Iberrocks coach Jared, who lost just two of 18 games.
The Dolly's offensive qualification forced the Hibernian club, backed by Gary Holtz, to finish second.
Zard will face Hearts, who are eight points clear of the leader, on Sunday, without winning any games in the Premiership.
Prior to that, Ranger will host Rapid Vienna at the Europa League.
Levin Stone continues his unbeaten run of six games under head coach Holt, who has left his former coach Kenny Miller.
Living Stone missed the opportunity in the game against the visiting team Blount.
The Holtz team must extend their gap by exploiting the Rangers' goalless draw.
Scott Robinson with a high attack, turned his face towards the goal; Alan Litgau was seen only trying to receive comfortable forward balls for Carrig Hatts.
The concern of the fielding team is that the Rangers may be disturbed by the presence of the visiting team.
The moral role of scoring is irrelevant to the referee.
When the Rangers got the perfect penalty, Living Stone reinforced Declan Gallagher and Robinson, and Menga converted the ball from their midfield to goal.
At that time, Rangers were in control of the ball, but they were able to defend well and the calm of goalkeeper Liam Kelly was superior.

Alan McGregor and Legaw clash with Livingston players as Scott Pittman takes care of a Rangers goalkeeper injury.
Livingston's goal line was repeatedly broken and easily overtaken, and the pressure from the Hokies, who replaced Glenn Middleton, was enough to give him two perfect penalties, including one on the hand.
'Casual' was the concern when analysing Livingstone's game

Livingston's event qualification and results
The precautions that human beings take to avoid leaving traces are remarkable.
Especially since they came to the leadership, their playing style and movement has not changed much, but the excitement that Halt has created in the team is much appreciated.
He has many heroes.
The Hulk was huge, especially successful in organizing the defensive unit; otherwise, we liked the manga Connor Goldson and Joey Warren.
Rangers' motivation for games was down.
They were good when they were under Zarad, but they scored lower than the standards set.
The problem is that their last balls are not effective after they have been pressed, which makes the team to stay in the middle of the table and stand still.
Ordoğan was received with a special welcome at Kolneni.
The Turkish and German leaders in Berlin for breakfast on Saturday (September 29) were seen with a clear sky and many were happy.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to Malmö to strengthen ties with NATO has reached its final day today.
They also advised on human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Ordoğan has been exported to Cologne to produce a large scale.
The city is home to many Turks outside Turkey.
Police explain why the protests in front of the mosque, which had stopped the 25,000 strong protesters, were stopped by a large number of supporters of the president, who instead came out to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurds, were heard in the crowd, criticizing Erdogan's policies and protesting against Germany's decision to accept the man.
The intense protests show a difference between those with German-Turkish citizenship who see the visitors as heroes and those who criticize them as dictators.

Long Lartin Correctional Facility: Six officers injured in the riot.
The correctional facility said six correctional guards were injured in a riot in the men's section of the facility, which is not heavily guarded.
The disturbance started at 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still reported to be unresolved.
A special police force, "Turnado", has arrived at the scene and is investigating the riot, with eight detainees and a group being identified as involved.
Police officers who suffered minor facial injuries during the riot were treated.
A correctional spokesperson said: "It has been suggested that a specially trained correctional task force be deployed to prevent further problems at HMP Long Lartin.
Six correctional facility workers are being treated for their injuries.
"We will not tolerate any disturbance in the correctional facility, and we will also inform the police about irresponsible people and bring them to court to keep them longer".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 recruits, including some of the country's most dangerous defendants.
The manager of the correctional facility was hospitalized in June after being attacked by a repairman, reports said.
Police officers were called to the correctional facility following a violent riot in October last year, when correctional workers were attacked with a pool ball.
The storm, known as Rosa, could cause flooding damage in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, but could benefit areas affected by drought.
A tropical depression is not expected to hit Arizona, but a flood disaster similar to the previous Rosa storm could occur in the southwest desert area, which has damaged infrastructure other than energy.
The National Weather Service has already forecast flooding in western Arizona and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix City, and in Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
Following the rains that began to pour on Monday, Rosa is expected to make his move to Phoenix on Tuesday.
"Ten tropical cyclones that have hit the 200-mile Phoenix area since 1950 are unique in nature and pose a threat to residents, not only the flood risk", the National Weather Service tweeted.
The 1967 Katrina storm, which included rain, covered the Z region by 40 miles. "
A recent model released by the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with rainfall of up to 6 inches in contrast to the rest, especially in the Arizona and Mogollon coastal areas.
The rest of the Bahamas, particularly the areas of the South East Bahamas and the Central Rockies, including the Great Basin, will experience rainfall of 1 to 2 inches, with a total rainfall of up to 4 inches.
For areas free from flood risk and which have experienced drought for many times, the rain of roses can be considered as good luck.
Although the flood is strong, rainfall is expected to be beneficial for some areas currently affected by drought, such as the southeast.
According to weather.com, "the drought control body in the US, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the worst drought ever recorded, the second worst drought on record".
The first, named Rosa, made its way to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico following landslides.
Strong Rosa will move 385 miles south of Punta Ignacia, 85 miles per hour with high winds Sunday morning across Mexico and continue to move north at 12 miles per hour.
The flood will cool the waters of the Pacific and will provide energy to the Pacific.
As a result, the intensity of tropical flooding is expected to cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon and evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected in various parts of Mexico, followed by heavy flooding.
"from jaja california to northwest sonora, a total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected, passing through it to 10 inches", weather.com reports.
Rosa will continue northward through Mexico before reaching the Arizona coastline on Tuesday morning, and will reach Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat from the storm and the weather that follows it is expected to be heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern California and across the United States in the desolate southwest", says the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to endanger lives, cause flooding, and cause flood debris to accumulate in desert areas and landslides, especially in mountainous areas.
midsomer norton attack: four attempted assassinations failed.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested following the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.

Police have appealed to anyone who has been blocked by mobile images to cooperate to help them make their work easier.
Trump said 'Cavanaugh is too tired, too uncooperative and too annoying for the Democratic Party.'
"Voting for the lawyer Kavanaugh is giving the Democratic Party the following tactic of brutality and disrespect", Trump, who campaigned in Wheeling, West Virginia, said.
Trump said "Cavanaugh is disrespectful and offensive to the goodwill of the Democratic Party in the election process".
Kavanaugh responded to Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual assault of a child ten years ago on Thursday before Congress, saying she was "overwhelmed by the power and emotion".
Ford also added evidence to the charges.
"The American people have seen the ingenuity, competence and initiative of Kavanaugh", the president said on Saturday.
"Voting for the lawyer Kavanaugh is like voting for the best legal mind of our time and giving a public service to someone who is aided by legal knowledge", he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president has made many statements about Kavanaugh's election, whether directly or not, with the intention of gaining support in the next midterm elections.
"five weeks have passed since the most important election we have ever seen.
"i am not running, i am running well", he said.
"that is why i am ready to fight the big candidates everywhere".
Trump protested that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and destroy".
The Grand Old Party's top leadership told CNN that the first practical election for Kavanaugh's candidacy will be held before the Senate is in session on Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the death toll is expected to rise.
An official said on Sunday that at least 384 people had been rescued and many more were displaced after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a tsunami and the coastline was hit by a massive wave.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, while a 6m or 18ft high wave, including those enjoying the sunset, caused numerous casualties and damage.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake followed the tsunami in the area.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, many people were on the beach doing their normal activities, and they did not even try to run away, which resulted in their deaths", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, of Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it was overturning cars, mines, houses, hitting everything on the ground", Ngoho said, noting that before the tsunami hit the coast, it was traveling at 800 km/h (497 mph) over the surrounding waters.
A few people managed to climb trees and survive the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 stations in Palu.
Several buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were broken and a mosque was flooded, according to aerial photos taken by the disaster agency.
A minor earthquake continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology and Application Assessment Agency said the quake in Andalucía was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location, which is located in a long and narrow gorge, made the tsunami more likely, he said.
Ngoho said the destruction was "massive", with thousands of homes, hospitals and shops destroyed.
The bodies of victims of the attack were found under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Death and destruction could be rising along the coast of Donggala, 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, near the epicenter of the earthquake, according to Nugroho.
No information could be exchanged from Donggala area as communication equipment was out of order, Ngoho said.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that "the organization's staff and volunteers have been directed to the site".
"It's very sad, but it could be worse", he said.
The agency was reportedly unable to report the tsunami's effects, despite the authorities' warnings that the tsunami had already arrived.
A video posted on social media by an amateur shows a man on a building with a loud, mixed-fears sound warning of an approaching tsunami.
In minutes, a towering tsunami washed cars and buildings from the shore
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the video:
The quake disrupted power lines in the Palu area, making rescue efforts difficult.
The army is delivering relief supplies by air from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the displaced people are in dire need of food and other basic assistance.
The city's airport has reopened for emergency operations only, but will remain closed until October.
The city's airport has reopened for emergency operations only, but will remain closed until October.
Indonesian tsunami deaths will be more than 800.
It is very bad.
World Vision people in Donggala, who had reached the city of Palu safely, where their staff were enclosed in tents, faced serious risks on their journey, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that many houses are out of use", he said.
It is very bad.
There were also complaints that some highly experienced foreigners were prevented from travelling to Palo when aid workers started their curfew.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid can only come after the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not been done yet.
"It is now considered a state emergency", said Auliya Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government declares it a national disaster, we will be open to international aid, but nothing is said about the disaster".
Palu is on the second day after Saturday's earthquake and tsunami, with friends and family hoping that the victims of that dark and terrible disaster will be found by some miracle.
A little boy was rescued from a flooded ravine on Saturday.
On Sunday, a woman who had been under the rubble for two days was rescued.
Gendon Sebandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two paragliders for the Asian Games, which ends this month, but both were lost in the accident.
Others detained in Ruwa Ruwa Bottel were his students, including Mr Mandagi, he said.
"As an experienced paraglider, I am personally under a lot of pressure and emotion.
Mr. Gendon, after hearing the news of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel, sent a WhatsApp message to the beach festival's Palu contestants, while explaining how the situation had spread through the paragliding community.
He was able to get only one grey check and one blue check.
" that means the messages didn 't arrive " , he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Newport on the Live ATM

[1Kanya West: The rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter on Saturday about the change: "Individual registered as Kanye West".
West, 41, briefly used the nickname Ye, but he used the moniker for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of the live release of his new album Yandehi on Saturday.
The producer of the show announced that Aryana Grande was going to perform her work on the day, but she canceled due to "instability".
Although the name is a professional acronym, he has previously stated that the word has a religious connotation.
"I believe the word "Y" is mentioned in the bible many times. It was in an interview with Big Boy radio station that the English word "you" was introduced.
" so here i am you, here i am us and here we are.
From Kanya or the only one, it has come to reflect the good, the bad, the controversial and the who we are.
The album is mostly a reflection of our identity.
He is one of several rappers to change their name.
Sean Comb has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy at various times, and this year he announced that he would choose Love or Love Brother.
Former West collaborator Jay-Z is known as JAY-Z, with or without a catapult and a dash in the middle.
The Mexican MLO pledged not to use force against civilians
In his speech on the 50th anniversary of the brutal and brutal attack on students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that no similar atrocity would be perpetrated by military force.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "we will absolutely not use military force to suppress Mexican citizens".
In the same square, on October 2, 1968, he shot and killed about 300 people at a peaceful rally, at a time when left-wing politics were beginning to take root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledges to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students who are studying at university and opening more free public universities.
He also said that unemployment and lack of educational facilities are leading young people to organized crime.
America: Artificial Intelligence: The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China increases its involvement in artificial intelligence, the United States should spend twice as much money on research and development as it does now, said Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI expert at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various US government agencies issued AI announcements, and the country is not even ready for an artificial intelligence strategy.
However, China announced its goal last year to become No.1 in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"While doubling growth may be a good start when other countries are far behind, we are working to bring about positive change", Lee said.
Doubling the funding would make the next major breakthrough the US, Lee said in an interview with CNN this week.
Li's book Artificial Intelligence is a Superpower, China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Hogg Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Face++.
He developed the highly successful artificial intelligence system for the American Otello player at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, and later served as a research and development executive at Microsoft and Google China.
Lee noted that earlier U.S. government programs such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, which recognized the contribution of technology competitions, would ask when similar competitions would take place to identify the next generation of visionaries.
researchers in the united states have noted that they must work hard to win government funding.
"It's not China that is taking away the corporate leaders, it's the companies", Li said.
Facebook, Google and Microsoft have hired promising students to work on artificial intelligence.
Li said the reform of the immigration police would have a greater impact on China's artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think a green card should be issued for students working in AI PhD", he said.
The Chinese State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Program in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Center of China provides financial support to educational institutions, which means that just like the National Science Foundation and other government foundations allocate funds to researchers in the US, the quality of Chinese educational work is poor, Li says.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which would allow industry and academia to engage, while the White House announced the creation of a separate committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced $2 billion for a project called Artificial Intelligence Next.[2]
NSF will invest $100 million in research and development of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US law aimed at establishing a National Security Commission has not seen any action this month.
Macedonians vote on whether to keep the country's name or change it
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country should be called the Republic of North Macedonia, which is believed to break the country's five-year-old alliance with Greece that kept it out of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a state of the same name called Macedonia, has used its right to veto the vote to withdraw from NATO or the European Union, using the same name.
The two countries reached an agreement on the name in June, but it has faced opposition from nationalists who say it undermines the identity of the Macedonian Slavic people.
President georgi ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and with the same campaign of no voting, the referendum reduced fears that the people would be able to get the required 50 percent.
The question on the ballot reads: "Stop the divorce with Greece and choose membership of NATO and the European Union".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the leading Yugoslav states that broke the referendum, is the price to pay for NATO and EU membership.
"I am here today to vote for the best for my country, especially the young people of Macedonia, who will live freely under the shadow of the European Union, because this will allow us all to live a comfortable life", said Olivera Giogijavska, 79, in a speech on Skype.
He said that although it is not prohibited by law, a sufficient number of MPs will be governed by the votes cast and will accept it as crucial.
The name change must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The Election Commission of the country said that no problems were encountered in connection with the election at 1 p.m.
The parliamentary elections were approved by 16 percent, compared to 34 percent last year, but this time 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, my home is Europe", 62-year-old Josie Tancheski, who voted in the capital, Skopje, said.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in Macedonia's September 30, 2018 referendum on changing the country's name, which would help it join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kvardarkov was seen with the protestors setting up a tent and setting up a small platform and chairs in front of the tent.
"we are with NATO and the EU, but we join with our necks up, not to be used by others in a disgraceful way", Kovadakov
"we are a poor nation, but we have dignity"
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we will join the Euro-Asian Union by turning our faces to China and Russia".
Prime Minister Zaev said that being a NATO member country would bring a lot of investment opportunities to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
After voting, Zaev said, "I believe that more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO".
He said the "yes" result is a guarantee of the next time".
A poll published by the Macedonian Police Research Institute on Monday found that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the number who did not vote.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of the survey participants planned to vote next Sunday.
70 percent of those surveyed said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be successful, one of the respondents must get one vote plus 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum marks the first time that a policy that has been in the interest of the Western government since May last year has failed.
See: Manchester City pressured Aguero to score for Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were the two who were the main distraction for the Brighton defenders in the 2-0 win over Manchester City at the English Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero was described as "stupid" after scoring in the 61st minute.
The Argentine striker was handed a good ball by the midfielders at the start of the match.
He was running with three Brighton defenders before he was abducted.
Aguero then found himself in the middle of four green tags.
Before entering the goal area at Brighton, he was hit by a defender
Then he was able to accept the Sterling on the left.
The English striker scored on the right side of the goal after the opposing team's goal-scoring goal was received directly by Aguero, who hit a right-footed green against Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Agüero is struggling with injuries on the court", said Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about playing for 55 or 60 minutes
And that's what happened.
"We are lucky to score under those circumstances"
Sterling created the first opportunity for the blue in the difficult Premier League game.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute
Aguero has been in a difficult position in Brighton's goal area.
He then gave a warm welcome to Leroy Sane on the left wing.

Trump's support rally in West Virginia
The president said it was important for the Supreme Court to win the Republican midterm election over Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we did in November was done in accordance with the Constitution.
Five weeks have passed since the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big ones: I am not running, I am running well, that is why I am everywhere to be the best candidate.
Trump continued: "You see this horrible group of Democrats, you have to pay attention to what is happening.
In addition, they are trying to seize power using every possible option, you see their futility and corruption.
"As long as they have power, they don't care if anyone hurts them. They want to have power and control. We won't give it to them".
According to him, "the democrats are on a mission to resist and destroy".
"As you can see, in the last four days, he's been calling Democrats "angry, uncaring, ignorant, and liars".
He called the Senate Legislative Committee and named Senate Democrat Danny Fenstain, and there was a strong voice in the audience.
"Remember What I Said?
Did you lose the document?
What?
"Never, oh never give it a chance - that's the worst sign language I've ever seen in my life.
There is no more exploitation of labor in the church.
people who say everything they think are impatient.
I am surprised that many of the works done by my party are not recognized
I am better than Labour MPs in terms of speaking the truth, but I don't accept it. Everyone is talking about what we think.
My fellow MP John Ryan has had the same experience because she was targeted by a campaign of deliberate smear.
I have hosted many tweets in a campaign of dissent with Jeremy Corbyn.
responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and Germany, and other issues where they disagreed with previous leaders.
"As the Nottingham East Labour Conference announced last Friday, "we want the conference to be inclusive and productive".
Friday night's GC meeting was the best of my eight years as a Labour MP.
Sadly, today there may be little to no assembly, and the politics of "good, good" have been raised many times, unless perhaps renewed.
There is a growing number of unilateral proposals within the Labour Party, and proposals are only accepted if they are approved by the party leadership.
This started after Jeremy was in office and I had already thought that I could get into power by accepting and supporting similar political views, including those that I disagree with, such as national security or the EU Single Market.
When I speak in public, there is no problem with what I say, the problem is that the social media is spreading misinformation, criticizing the politics and saying that I should not continue in the Labour Party.
And this is not my experience.
Of course, I believe I am more fortunate than my friends, because the comments that come to me are politically motivated.
I personally admire the professionalism and the unwavering commitment of my colleagues who face the daily harsh sexual and racial abuse.
The most irritating thing about politics is that the amount of influence that it produces is common.
Gerby Corbyn suggested last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that there is no big church, and every time Motion We change the electoral law without confidence, the party becomes weaker.
"for the past two years, i have been advised to be low-key and talk-free, and now i am successful"
But I didn't bring that into politics.
Inspired by the Thatcher government, I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student and when my overall academic performance started to decline, I thought I could become a local councillor or a government minister to serve many in the Public Service.
I have not hidden my political views, including the last election.
There is no one in West Nottingham who is confused by my policy stance and disagrees with the current leadership.
I want to say to all those who support the Friday motion, in my loyalty to the Labour Party, I could not afford to waste time and money on the Bri Exhibition, knowing that it would harm the country's standard of living, business and public services.
I have a message, not to stop the Nottingham movement, but to the Constitution, which is relevant to the Labour Party and the other: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise, no threat or political convenience will stop me from doing what I believe in and to fulfill your wishes.
Chris Leslie is the MP for West Nottingham.
Ayr 38  17 Melrose: The unstoppable Ayr went to another place
The two late losers are close to the final, but Ayr will no doubt finish the day's Tennis Premiership race.
They are leading the table with 10 games without a win.
Finally, the strong defense and the ability of the players to use the good opportunities helped them win on the field, which was followed by the coach Peter Murche.
"We have been tested in many matches so far and we have not lost a single game, and I am happy with that", he said.
Robin Christy, the owner of the mall, said: "Thanks to Ayr, they created better opportunities than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt was converted into a goal by Fraser Clem to give Ayr the lead, but the yellow card given to Scotland's champion Rory Hughes gave the Warriors the advantage and made Melrose move better and Jason Batts the opportunity to try balls that could not be scored.
Climo scored the goal that confirmed Ayr's lead in the penalty shootout near the end of the half, and in his subsequent efforts, he scored another goal to lead Ayr to a 17-5 record.
Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson made the gap five with Baggott replacing him.
Ayr, led by Clymo, has been able to retain the lead with Stafford McDowell following a long-term injury to Ruardi Knott, who was out of the game from the start.
When Ayr's well-placed player Blair Maperson saw a yellow card, Melrose replaced Brook Colvin following the pressure of the game.
Despite the field advantage, Strouhan Hitchinson saw a yellow card when he was caught by Clemon outside the penalty area; Ayr MacPherson, who was the winner, was hit from behind.
A minor earthquake continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The game star is still considering a career in the restaurant industry.
Current game star Ford Kerren is considering a move into the hospitality industry and will be named director of a licensed restaurants company once founded.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis wrote and starred in the popular BBC show, which featured the main characters and his longtime friend Greg Hempfert.
The organizers stated that the ninth series will be the show's final tour and will present the plans for the next Kiran after Cragg Lang.
As per official records, he is a director of Adrift Moor Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kearny was considering a "successful restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours', the tribunal hopes to open the way for the landlocked country of Bolivia to connect with the Pacific.
Seamen seize a ship loading various machines in the capital city of Lappe.
Public buildings have flown a water blue flag.
From Lake Ticako, the Amazon's main sites are marked with the slogan: "According to the law, the sea is ours.
It is our duty to rescue. "
Memories of the 19th century rich coastline conflict that still stands out in the bloody landlocked Bolivia are showing a desire to capture the Pacific Ocean, at least not by Chile.
These expectations were high for decades before Bolivia filed a lawsuit with the International Criminal Court on October 1 after five years of relief.
"Bolivia must look positively at the transition that comes with strength, unity of spirit and freedom from stress", said Roberto Cazadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on the country's big screens, hoping that Chile will decide that it is the sovereign maritime state of Bolivia after decades of fruitless talks in the Zhejiang process.
The decision of the controversial Bolivian president Evo Morales on Monday will not provide relief for the then semi-professional Bolivian in the next year's re-election.
"We are getting very close to the Pacific Ocean", he said in August.
But some analysts expressed the belief that the court's decision would not be a verdict for Bolivia, and that if it did, things would change.
The UN body, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no authority to determine the boundaries of Chile, nor does it have the authority to determine the outcome of any talks.
Paz Zarate, a Honut Chilean international law expert, said that the decision of the International Court of Justice, six months after the final dispute was filed, "shows that the case is not complicated".
They can make us go back four years beyond the cause of Bolivia's list.
"The issue of approaching the sea has been blocked by the Bolivian administration", he said.
Morales' opponent said in her speech that the decision would protect the dignity of Chileans.
I think Bolivia and Chile are having a hard time talking about the hon.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former president Rodriguez Waltz, who represented Bolivia in the Zambezi, said the speed at which the court reached a decision was unusual.
"Monday will be the opening of a new phase of relations between Bolivia and Chile, which will put aside the disagreements of the last 139 years and work for the benefit of both countries", he said.
Morales, one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue to create political fever, says Cazadilla.
"Bolivia will not give up its legal right to use the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The decision is a good opportunity to undo the past"
North Korea says it is unthinkable to stop nuclear unless we can trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ry Yong Ho, said the country would not dismantle nuclear weapons unless there was first confidence in the United States.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last Saturday.
the united states must keep its word as promised at the singapore summit of world leaders.
His comments came as the United States, the UN Secretary General, is trying to restart now forgotten nuclear diplomacy three months after talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Reye said that maintaining sanctions is a "dream", and that the US's refusal to accept the end of the Korean War will not benefit North Korea.
The United States is skeptical of a deal where Pyongyang does not significantly reduce its weapons.
Both Kim and US President Trump want a second dialogue.
Pyongyang is not expected to reduce its weapons in the interest of its safety, which has raised widespread suspicion.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month and pave the way for the second round of talks between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show has unveiled the industry's achievements with a large number of headwear.
If you want to raise your helmet or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a large-size hat for their SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week, and they hope to continue their creativity.
This summer, Instagram is overwhelmed by unusable hats, and designers have turned their eye-catching creations into catwalks.
Valentino's hat was decorated with a long, lantern-like frame and was the pinnacle of innovation.
Other large hats, such as the habbhab and pineapple-decorated witch hats, are available but are not designed to provide warmth to the head.
Tom Brown also offers a unique face mask for the holidays.
Other facials in different colors are more like Hannibal Lester than lipstick and other things.
One invention looks like scuba diving, and the rest looks like melted ice cream in the shape of a cone.
If you keep visiting the big fashion houses, you're certainly not lucky.
As fans of the style have already guessed, the many hats with their own straps attract the attention of many.
The large, two-foot-long, wooden cap, which was worn by the long-hill 'La Bomba', has been found in various places, from Rihanna to Emili Tatjackowski.
The unique size of the hat is considered as the next best innovation from Cat representative and has attracted the attention of many on social media, along with the bag of a pale yellow color that is designed as a swimsuit.
The Ravera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week Jacqueme is a black orange, fringe-lined, white laser-branded bag.
As noted stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main street next summer - it's hard to say that there won't be interest in these large-scale special uses because the designer has had such a huge impact.'
John edward: language skills are important for global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland achieved their highest ever academic performance in 2018 through the strong work of individuals and teams in sport, art, music and other community-based activities.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, representing over 30,000 students in schools across Scotland, is committed to providing the best possible service to students and parents.
The private schools are working with the aim of preparing their students for the career and place they have chosen as a citizen for further higher education.
As a curriculum, modern languages have become the subject of choice in schools, including the reputation of the education specialist.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you speak to a native speaker, let him understand.
When talking to the native speaker, let him be of the same mind. "
It should be borne in mind that we should not rely on English alone to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
The private schools have the highest passing grades in the league table for the languages that can be understood in this year's results.
68% of the students have scored A in foreign languages.
Data collected from SCIS and focused on 74 member schools showed that 72% of those who scored the highest A scores studied Mandarin, 69% French, and 63% Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland have recognised the importance of foreign languages for the future of children and young people.
Currently, the language is taught as a single subject in the curriculum of private schools and in other subjects such as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that language was the main reason for 17% of employees having difficulty filling out job advertisement forms.
Therefore, the development of more and more language skills by young people is very important for their future career.
In a sovereign world, language skills are important for most job opportunities.
The person will get a lifetime benefit of learning a second language, not depending on the chosen field of work.
Those who speak multiple languages to communicate directly with foreigners win the competition.
According to YGov, in the 2013 election, in which more than 4000 young people from the United Kingdom participated, 75% of the voters said they could not speak foreign languages fluently to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is considered very important to spend money on language teaching for the children who are currently in school.
Having more resources, especially for those with a developing economy, will create meaningful continuous employment opportunities for children.
There is a difference in the languages taught in each school in Scotland.
A large number of schools are teaching in a more modern language, while others such as Mandarin or Japanese will consider the UK language as the most important language for the future after 2020.
Regardless of your child's preferences, the choice of languages that your child wants to learn in private schools will also be done with the help of specialised experts in the field.
Scottish private schools are committed to creating an educational environment that prepares children for the future and empowers them to succeed.
In the global business environment, language is crucial for the future of countries, and it should not be forgotten that it should be included in education at this time.
Indeed, modernists should pay attention to "global communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer diversity and openness to Scottish youth.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
The Broncos are bringing him to San Diego for the first time on Sunday.
The crowd of fans who came to see Bronn James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time was too large, he said.
Laker coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in the opening pre-season game in San Diego.
But how many minutes will be played is yet to be determined.
"It could be more than one and more than 48", Walton says on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Truder tweeted that James could play for a few minutes.
Following the start of training earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-competition matches to prepare at this level of my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia support session, youtube channel
President Trump kicks off a series of support rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is one of five trips Trump is planning for next week, including trips to friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote needed to confirm the Supreme Court nomination temporarily suspended, Trump is planning to rally support for the Republican in the November midterm elections, as Congress risks losing control to the Republicans.
Trump's inauguration in West Virginia is at what time tonight, and how can it be streamed live on the internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7PM Eastern time on Saturday night, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia speech can be watched live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak at the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Rhett Kavanaugh this week, but he has complicated the situation with his alleged inappropriate conduct in connection with the child abuse case, which could lead to the Senate voting to extend the FBI investigation by a week.
The purpose of this series of moves is to enable the Republicans to gain the support for the November election.
So, the Trump campaign says the five moves next week are aimed at "maintaining and expanding Republican majority seats in the Senate and House of Representatives by mobilizing goodwill and supporters", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is his top agenda, and as we approach the presidential campaign phase, he's going to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's planned rally to the Wheeling Arena in Weasbanco is expected to attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh's media attention", according to West Virginia Metro.
Trump's visit to West Virginia on Saturday will be the second time in the past month, after winning by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate
"The president's arrival to give the race a boost is not a good sign for Mauritius", said Simon Heder, a political scientist in West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 Team America showcase Belly for match to give life to hope Sunday among the unmarried
After three one-man events, the four-man event on Saturday afternoon appears to be one of the requirements for inclusion in this Ryder Cup.
The game of swing is a complete invention of the sport concept, but one that the players believe in more than anything else in such competitions.
So when do they say the peak is now?
"They were ahead by six points, now by four, so I guess we'll just take that as a little bit of a climb", he said, walking slowly.
Europe has a better lead, with 12 games to go
The Americans feel they have a very slim chance, as does Space, although they have a higher chance of being fired, especially from players like Space and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day, each claiming four out of three points.
Space is a killer, and he's leading the way from T to Green.
As the round progressed, the excitement and shouts increased, with decisive and effective hits to tie the fourth match, he and Thomas were down by two after the second.
His shot to win Game 15 was equally applauded, which is the sort of thing that makes you believe that the US team is not out of the tournament.
"You really have to look at it and worry about your game", says Sepeys.
This is the main thing that every player ignores.
18 Holes to be marked
The only players to score more points than both Space and Thomas in the last two years are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flewood, which is the unmistakable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's most confusing but popular pair is four out of four, and they don't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only pair to miss a hole in one shot on Saturday afternoon, and also missed a shot on Saturday morning.
All that running and the power that was being poured out from the fans and the fans made them feel like they were winning the match on Sunday, and there was no one player who could beat the Europeans because the sun was shining on Molinari over Fleetwood for Golf National.
In the case of a lead, both are in the same time but in different holes.
Although it is impossible to talk about European dignity.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a little work on Sergio Garcia, one of the morning's winning pairs, which led to him being paired with Alex Noreen.
The Spaniard and the Swede have scored two goals in one hole, which is a shot they have never come close to before.
Sunday, even if there is no one to help, get out of your hole yourself.
Two-pair and four-four games are very interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between pairs, when they match, when they don't match and how the strategy changes in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is the main leader on the final day but Team USA is keen to play despite the doubts on the side of Stateside, as the four-four match showed.
Europe led 10-6 to the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy lead to the Ryder Cup final, which will be played on Saturday, with the USA leading 10-6 in the two-way tie.
The rebounded pair of Timothy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari took the lead with two wins over the challenger Tiger Wood, raising their Lehigh Golf National points by four.
Thomas Bjorn's Europeans have a 3-1 lead over the USA, who were outscored in the morning double, to avoid the trophy that Hazeltine lost two years ago.
The United States has been better in the four-four, winning two matches, but not enough to fill the gap.
He needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to avoid the cup through Jim Furyk
Fleetwood is the newest European to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood", are the second pair to score four points in their opening four matches following a thrilling weekend in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After knocking out Woods and Patrick in the double, they went on to win the match by a dramatic margin, beating Woods and American rookie Bryson DeChambaugh by a significant 5&4.
Woods pushed himself to two games in Saturday's match, breaking the normal record, losing 19 of 29 matches in a pair and four-four and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who spent the morning's doubles competition on break, returned in a four-four match with his teammate Henrik Stetsen, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooke Coepa - who were ranked first and third in the world.
Despite a windy western day in Paris, what Europeans have not found
Three-time major winners Jordan Space and Justin Thomas set an example for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In a pair match, they scored a brilliant point against Spain's John Rahman and Ian Palter, and then went on to beat Paulter and Rory McCain in a four-for-4 tie.[4]
Although Furyk is only looking to break away goalless to avoid the trophy, it is only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has managed to come back from a four-point deficit to a single game.
The second best for two tons, but Sunday's counterattack seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will 'never' disarm without faith
North Korea's foreign ministry told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were deepening its mistrust of the United States and that it was therefore unable to stop its nuclear weapons alone.
North Korea has taken positive steps in the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests and demolishing the test site, and pledging to not use nuclear weapons, Yong Ho told the World Health Organization General Assembly.
"But we have not received an adequate response from the US", he said.
"We cannot rely on our national security without any faith in the United States, we cannot disarm ourselves in isolation in such a situation".
While Rim cited the same common North Korean complaint that Washington was refusing to proceed with denuclearization and that North Korea would receive a fair reward for it, the statement made it appear necessary that Pyongyang did not abandon its independent denuclearization program in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump, which was the first meeting between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore, and said that when Kim pledged to free the Korean Peninsula from the nuclear zone, Trump would also give confidence to North Korea's security.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 war, but the US says Pyongyang must prioritize its nuclear program.
Washington also opposes calls for relaxing the sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States will insist on the first "dismantling of nuclear weapons", and will use sanctions to pressure for their forcible entry, "and will oppose any ceasefire", Ri said.
" Trying to humiliate us with punishment is a failed dream and an idea of stupid people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuing sanctions have deepened the mistrust between us.
Ri did not mention the US leader's comments at the UN about the second meeting between Trump and Kim.
The ministry instead referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that "the Korean nuclear-free zone would not have been a problem if it were South Korea, not the United States, as the main actor on the issue of denuclearization".
While Ri's voice is significantly different from last year, when he spoke to the United Nations, the General Assembly targeted the US mainland after "Mir Vice President" Trump called Kim "the rocket man", the North Korean rocket that was inevitable.
Trump did not threaten to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, and this year he praised Kim for his efforts to resolve the conflict, but said many projects remained to be completed and sanctions should continue even if North Korea declared nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, if it takes three months or five months - that's not a problem".
China and Russia are in dispute at the UN Security Council, Pyongyang should be rewarded for its process.
But US Security Council Secretary General Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must continue uninterrupted and inevitably until the process of denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council has imposed secret sanctions on North Korea to suspend funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile development since 2006.
Pompeo met with the EU-backed Riyadh, and the General Assembly said they would visit Pyongyang next month to facilitate a second round of talks.
Pompeo visited North Korea for the third time this year alone, but the third visit did not produce the expected results.
When they released Pyongyang in July, they reported changes in the time difference, which is how they were organizing their forces.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea said the US should take "similar steps" to dismantle their missile sites and nuclear power plants.
He said Kim would "take the same steps" to ensure their safety, and Trump said the pledge in Singapore was to elevate relations with Washington to a better level.
Harvard students took a lesson on getting enough rest.
"This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University are being trained to get enough sleep and to stop the practice of studying with 'caffeinated nights.'"
The world's number one university, which produces the most talented students, is said to be low on fundamentals and how students see themselves.
Charles Esler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Birmingham and Women's Hospital, developed a course he believes is unique in the United States.
It is also recommended to start training on the impact of sleep deprivation on education.
'Finally, a woman came to me and said, 'Why was I told this now and not years ago?'
While she said that no one had ever told her about the benefits of sleep, Assu told the Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which was first introduced this year, teaches students that good sleep helps them to improve academic and athletic performance and maintain their overall health.
Paul Barrera, professor at Harvard Medical School and director general of University Health Services, said he decided to launch the course after finding students with severe sleep problems during the week.
The hour-long training consists of many engaging activities.
In one classroom, students, including students with coffee snacks, curtains, coaches, and athletes, report a decline in athletic performance due to the effects of caffeine and light, as well as lack of sleep, and a constant observance of bedtime.
In another group, participants were told that long sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
The training participants are encouraged to think about their daily activities in a comprehensive way.
'We know that the behavior of students does not change immediately.
"We believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Szeszler added.
There is still a culture of pride in not sleeping at night, he says, and the use of modern technology, and the pressure on students, is a growing problem.
Make sure you get enough sleep in a comfortable way, this is a secret tool of students to stop stress, fatigue and fear, and he says that to lose weight, lack of sleep makes the mind feel hungry and constantly hungry.
The 19-year-old Californian, who studies chemical and physical biology and helped to design the course, was a student of Professor Seitzler, who took a day class last year during his freshman year at Harvard University.
He said that the course made him open his eyes and encouraged him to take other courses in the campus.
He hoped that all post graduate students should be told that they should follow similar programs and complete training before going to the next competitive institutions.
Professor Chessler advises students to use alarm to go to bed and to get up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from electronic screens and LEDs, which can also lead to heart failure and insomnia.
Living Stone 1-0 Rangers: The goal of the manga disappointed the players of Gerard.
Rangers suffered a devastating defeat, with Steven Gerrard's team, which was devastated by Dolly Menga's attack, losing 1-0 at Livingstone.
The Iberrocks are not looking to record their first win since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone La, but Gary Holtz's team is weak: Gerard has managed his second loss in 18 games, ruining the lead by eight points.
Menga was exhausted with seven minutes left in the first half, and Rangers played the field with good motivation.
Rangers are now relegated to sixth, while Living Stones have been relegated to third after a goalless draw in Hibernian.
There is also a possibility of further disruption in the Rangers property section, where the linebacker threw something from the other direction and injured Spence in the head.
Gerard made eight substitute appearances in the semi-final at Betfred, which knocked Ayr out of the competition.
On the other hand, Holt are happy that they have managed to put pressure on their opponents in all matches, while they were able to beat Hearts with the Livi 11 last week.
Rangers were better with ball control, but Living Stones were seen doing better with the ball.
Menga has to score in two minutes after Allen McGregor's goal knocked Scott Pittman out of the competition, but he can expand his chances.
Kegan Jacob's strong penalty kick with the perfect penalty shot came against defender Craig Hulket, who was hit by his teammate Alan Littow in a goal-kicking attempt.
Rangers were good at ball control, and they are more than confident in their third place game.
Alfredo Morelos clashed with Steven Lawless in the first quarter, but referee Steven Thompson ignored Colombia's request.
Rangers had two goal-scoring attempts in the first half, with former Iberox goalkeeper Liam Kelly being disrupted by Lhasa Kolibaly's forehead balls and Ove Igeria's shocking attempts.
Levi's 34th minute opener is against the game, which no one can deny.
The Rangers have failed to contact Jacob again.
Scott Arfield gave the ball to Scott Robinson as Declan Gallagher; Menga scored with a free kick.
1] Gerard made an impact by replacing Ryan Kent with Coulibaly, where the winger Merylos was able to make an immediate impact, while the amazing Kelly tried to defend.
But the Living Stones must use the Ligtgaut and Hulket long balls to play the kind of game the foreign team enjoys.
As the Holtz consolidated their lead in the final rounds, Litgaw tried to stop Jacob before starting the attack from the corner.
The Rangers' new signing Glenn Middleton demands a penalty kick following Jacob's attack, but Thompson ignores him.
The Almanac - The Creator of the Giger Counter
The following pages are taken from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882 Today, 136 years ago, continues the countdown... The day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which evolved into the Geiger counter.
The science spine is the backbone of the Giger counter, which was popularized by the 1995 film "Bells of Coronado" by scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
"What is on earth?"
Rogers "a Giger counter was used to detect the presence of radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear headphones in your ears, you can hear the effects of radioactivity atoms in the mine. "
"Stop! It's going to break!"
"Hans" Gregor died in 1945, and his 63rd birthday is just days away.
but what he feared made his name live.
The new cancer vaccine has created a new immune system.
The new cancer vaccine has created and killed a new immune system.
The vaccine produces cells that are the backbone of the body's immune system, which is part of the treatment.
The method is to extract the immune cell from the patient in the laboratory.
Then it is common to see a protein in many cancers, which is then re-injected.
A vaccine being tested against cancer is showing promising results.
One woman who received the vaccine had a new cancer in her ovaries, which disappeared after more than 18 months.
In this method, the immune cell is taken from the patient and transformed in the laboratory, wherein a protein called HER2 is detected in many cancers and then allowed to attack the cell.
"The results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Jay Berzowski, professor at the United Nations Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
"HER2 can cause a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and prostate cancer", said Professor Berzowski.
The training on how to take immune cells from the patient and monitor cancer cells is the same as that for treating leukemia.
After Kanye West appeared on SNL, MAGA was watching Trump's criticism, which made him a hat-trick.
It is not going well.
Kanye West was heard in the studio on Saturday night praising the United States for his unproductive performance, saying President Donald Trump will be in office in 2020.
After playing the third song, Ghost Town, he took the Make America Great hat and criticized Democrats for his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "how could you like Trump? He's a racist".
Well! If I had thought about racism, I would have left the US years ago".
SNL's show begins with Hollywood star Matt Damon, with Brett Kavanaugh in the lead, and focuses on the Senate Judiciary Committee's sexual assault case, hosted by Christine Beasley Ford.
A moving image of Western anger posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock and not shared by the media.
Trying to fool West is not clear to me.
West told the audience that he had a difficult time with his headdress behind the scenes.
"I was threatened from behind the scenes.
'Don't go where the hood is,' they say
They threatened me!
According to the Washington Examiner, they say I'm in a stable place.
Westerners continued, "Do you want to see a lower ground?" and then he said, "Make my Superman hat, because you don't tell me what to do.
"I was born with a heart condition.
Two comments were made from the audience, and it was noted that SNL cast members were uncomfortable, with one individual reporting from various sources: "The studio as a whole was gripped with resentment".
Westerners are talking about Ariana Grande's relationship with another man following the death of her ex-boyfriend and rapper Mac Miller a few days ago.
West's outfit was like a Perrier Bottle, which impressed the crowd with his song I Love It.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the greatest heroes of all time, thank you for standing up for the people".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply put it this way: "It's presented in person and that's beautiful".
"But I don't choose to encourage someone by buying the music or the clothes or the "artwork") which is, in my opinion, a dangerous way of thinking and spraying.
He is free.
We also said, "As she said:
Before the show, the rapper announced on his Twitter account that he had changed his name, saying, "This is the man that was known in Kenya West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of An Didi, Pafi, and P Didi.
Friends, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and Prince, a former musician and a contemporary, changed his name to a symbol.

The goal for Game of Thrones is a goal that star Keith Harington has been dangerously masculine about.
Keith Harington plays a young gladiator named John Shaw in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, who is a male patriot, said such stereotypes make young boys think they have to be very strong to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times, he asks how we can fight this deadly masculinity mentality when something is wrong with culture.
"I feel very important", said Keith, who recently married 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones.
'I have a strong feeling that the Tugar is wrong about the current situation of crime?' he said.
'What were we teaching boys in the present difficult times?'
Television is partly responsible for the bulk of the male-dominated content, thanks to its male characters.
what are natural and what are not?
What is it about TV, what is it about the streets, that makes a young man feel so masculine?
So the big question of our time is: how do we change this?
The reason is that something is wrong with our boy.
In an interview, he stated that he will not be doing any prequel or post-sequel when the series ends next summer, announcing the cancellation of 'War Horse and Tales'.
From next November, Keith will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a man who is the brother of a film producer who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he planned to meet his wife Rose and that he thought she was the best from Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show and so he gave me my future wife, and my life will be in that from now on,' he said.
Kit's character John Shaw played Rose Yegrethan in the Emmy Award-winning series Fantasy as a romantic interest.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Laisley family estate in Scotland.
China reports 14% increase in new HIV/AIDS cases
China reports that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has jumped to 14%.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people have been affected.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new arrests are in homosexual relationships, a change from last year.
Until now, HIV transmission in some parts of China was common through the donation of infected blood to healthy people.
But in this situation, the number of HIV infections has been reduced to almost zero, the Chinese health official in Yunnan province said.
However, the number of people living with HIV in China is growing by 100,000 people every year.
HIV transmission through sex is a major issue for the LGBT community in China.
In the same year, same-sex violence was made a crime in China, and LGBT crimes are on the rise.
Studies suggest that due to the country's conservative culture, 70 - 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Most HIV transmission is due to inadequate precautions in these settings.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatment nationally accessible as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxie Waters denies the Senator's data and explosion 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory' of her colleague, Mashlok
The US, like myself, Maxie Waters, denied on Saturday that a colleague had posted the personal information of three US senators on the parliamentary Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat has called the "radical wing" of the party and the websites are ignoring it.
"Fake lies and shameful lies", Waters wrote on Twitter.
The leaked information included your US home and phone address: Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch both from Ottawa.
The information was posted by an unknown person on Cattrall Hill, which was online on Thursday, when a Senate panel was advising Supreme Court nominee Rhett Kavanaugh on sexual misconduct charges.
The dismissal came after three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pandit and Red State reported that the Committer IP address was linked to Waters' office and that the information of the Waters employee was leaked, The Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie, Waters", she said.
"My colleague's identity, personal data and security were compromised by this false and fraudulent allegation and Mashlok was never responsible for this information.
This is a false accusation, a complete lie".
Waters's statement was quickly met with criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"this betrayal is madness", wrote flaicher.
"This shows that she does not have the patience to be a member of Congress.
they should not be angry when someone is criticized for something they did not do.
they should not be disobedient.
They should not ask what the boy wants.
They must be calm and peaceful.
Fletcher compares Waters's situation to the way he was angry at the Democratic rally Thursday, where he accused Justice Kavanaugh.
Omar Navarro, who is running to remove Waters from her seat in the midterm elections, tweeted his vote.
"If it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office "has shifted the proper authorities and law enforcement agencies" in this fraudulent allegation.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and will be held legally accountable for their destructive and dangerous actions to any and all members of our service".
Johnny England Strike Scene: The Incompetent Shame of Rowan Atkinson
Now it is becoming common to see the need for Brexit in a new film from a British perspective and it will be the reason for the Johnnie England action blockbuster: The Comedy Horror Contract, which was previously launched by The Johnnie Show in England in 2003 and was also aired by Johnnie England in 2011.
How can tang in chick be a good example of how the country's new export opportunities are unrelentingly trash-sweeping us?
In no way, Pop Id, Rubberface, and John England are being re-launched for a second time to make things better - and this is what the show is all about, especially for non-English speaking cinemas.
He is indeed a foolish spy, though he is a bit close to the cliché in a simulated and confusing way: Mr. Bean's spirit and masculinity contributed little to the opening of the 2012 London Olympics theme of Charities of Fire.
He first appeared in a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial based on the adventurous and unabashedly mysterious Atkinson, sparking much controversy before it began.
There will be one or two good times on this new GE tour.
I loved it when Johnny England approached the helicopter wearing a medieval shield and helmet.
Atkinson's body is a comic gift, but the humor is very energetic and tragically lacking in depth, especially compared to the comedy-like 007 and Mission Impossible.
The entertainment value seems to be focused on children rather than adults and the confused mess of Johnny England in Atkinson's silent film Dogs of the Bones.
The current recurring theme is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercriminal breaks into the British spy network's most secure network, exposing British spies in the field and even shocking a low-level spy named Kevin Eldon.
Emma Thompson did her best to portray this fake Theresa May character, but there is nothing to do in the script.
The intelligence adviser has been injured in every intelligence operation, so she has to bring in a retired person.
That is, the confused John England himself, who is now the director of a school for the rich, but the lesson is how to be a secret spy, some good bosnian say, here in England there is a spy school like rock.
England was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency statement, where he was able to reconnect with his former and much-troubled assistant Boh, played by Ben Miller again.
Boh is now married, stuck with a pirate sailor, with a beautiful hockey stick role, and thus, Vicky Pedain.
So the whole matter of Batman and Robin's strict espionage of the Queen is back in the works, with Olga Kurailekko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ofelan Bulatova taking the lead.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the hands of dangerously tech billionaire peers, who are promising to solve Britain's computer problems, as seen in Jack Lacey, played by the wealthy Jason Volta.
England and Bohm embark on a hectic adventure: they set fire to a French restaurant pretending to be a host; they embark on a luxury cruise ship called the Volta and have trouble escaping; England tries to introduce itself to the interior of the Volta House using a virtual reality headset, but quickly unravels the plot.
All the stops for the final series are definitely out, but it is popular and hot, so the overall setting is like a little children's TV.
my beauty is unfathomable.
And I can't stop thinking about the other John England films, can't the British film industry do justice by giving Rowan Atkins a role that deserves his talent?
Leber denied that he was working on a four-day week but a five-day pay plan.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a plan to leave and the British will work four days a week, but pay will be five days.
The party is said to want to spend the time saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving the bosses of the company an extra day of rest to the employees.
He sees employees taking three days off weekly, but still take home the same pay.
The idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to modernize the country in a way that benefits workers, sources said.
trade unions approve the shift to a four-day week to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A longtime Labour Party source told the Sunday Times the policy review is expected to be released before the end of the year.
"Not at once, but a hoped-for success that would align with the party's path to rebalancing the economy in support of workers and the party's overall industrial leader plan".
The Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 election campaign, so the Labour Party would not be the first to make this proposal public.
However, the hope of success is not being fully realized by the Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow chancellor john mcdonell uses the labour conference last week to explain his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
mir mcdonell said that he would remove the powers of the anonymous executives and profiteers in the private polling organizations.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their full stake because the Labour government may make cuts due to illegal activity.
It also confirmed plans to create ownership assets that would put employees on company boards and 10 percent of the value of private sector companies' shares, and up to £500 a year in profits.
Lidsley graham tells 60 minutes that john kennedy may change his mind about the fbi investigation into cavanaugh.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh's FBI investigation of the charges has delayed the final vote for Supreme Court impeachment by at least a week, and it shrinks the question of whether the office's findings could lead any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes news anchor Scott Pelley asked Republican senators if the FBI could find anything that could change the minds of John F. Kennedy and Lindsley Graham.
Kennedy seemed more clear than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I'm sorry, that's exactly what Kennedy said".
 i thought i was going to hear the testimony, i thought i was going to sit down with judge cavanagh
After this happened, i called him, the guilty plea came up, did you do it?
he was firm, determined, and unpretentious.
however, graham's voice seems to be very difficult or impossible to change.
I have made up my mind about bret cavanahan and accept a potential problematic charge.
"i don't know what happened, dr. ford, but i do know this: brett insisted, christine blasey added graham, citing ford.
and he couldn't verify anyone he called by name.
He is 36 years old.
nothing new is being changed.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York is hosting the annual Global Citizens Festival on Saturday, which features a collection of the most exciting stars and an equally exciting mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival brings tens of thousands of people to Great Lawn Central Park not only to enjoy the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to raise awareness for the group's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The global citizen festival is part of the global poverty project, an international advocacy group that believes it can end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty, as it did in 2012.
To receive the free ticket (unless you volunteered to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to complete a series of small tasks or activities such as volunteering, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to raise awareness with the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Cities 12 years from the goal?
Is rewarding people for free viewing a valid way to convince people that they want to watch the action or is it "clicktivism" that people feel like they've made a real difference by complaining or tweeting online?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded over 19 million "engagements" from its fans, which has prompted it to set various goals.
These actions have prompted world leaders to make commitments and formulate policies worth over $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 performance-related announcements, with at least $10 billion paid or collected through grants.
The group estimates that the money raised will affect up to 649 million people worldwide.
Among the major accomplishments, the food giant Almi, a U.K.-based partnership of investors and executives, pledged $35 million to help Rwanda eliminate malnutrition after receiving 4,700 tweets from global citizens for "Helping Children Reach Their Full Skills".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like yourself, we will make history of social inequality and malnutrition", said Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, in a live audience in London in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 actions to improve maternal and infant nutrition in the U.K., the government announced it will fund the Power of Nutrition project, which is aimed at more than 5 million mothers and babies.
In response, one FAQ website asks, "What motivated you to end extreme poverty?"
The world's citizens answer: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, like the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are among those who will present their work at this year's event in New York.
Russia could use its navy to "stop" energy exports: spokesman
Washington could turn to its navy to defend Russian energy markets, including the Middle East, "if necessary", US Interior spokesman Ryan Zinke said, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has made clear the Russian intervention in Syria - especially at the invitation of the legitimate government - as an excuse to gain a new energy market.
"I believe the reason they entered the Middle East was to interfere with power, as they did in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And, in the view of the authorities, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that our sea lanes are open through our navy, and, if necessary, to shut them down and prevent their energy supply from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to an audience at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a charity group in the US that calls itself "The Voice of Energy Consumers".
He went on to compare Washington's approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are similar in effectiveness.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is to reduce, enforce and replace oil", he said, referring to Russia's reliance on fossil fuel as "a unique competitor".
The statement comes as the Trump administration replaces Russia and increases its mission to export liquefied natural gas, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unrealistic" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which in Trump's view would make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly announced that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project was simply due to economic reasons and e-fair competition.
"I believe we share the view that pressure cannot be a means of coercion and that opponents should choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy spokesman Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US proposal has faced strong opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries, the leading German industry organization, BDI, has called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement in Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts legislator Elizabeth Warren says she will "take a hard look" to run for president in 2020
Massachusetts legislator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will "take a hard look" at running for president after the midterm elections.
at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, convention hall, confirmed that she was considering running.
According to The Hill, "it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top", she said.
"after october 26, i will seriously consider running for president".
"He is leading the country in the wrong direction", Warren said during a rally at the White House, voting against President Donald Trump.
"i am deeply upset about what donald trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren expressed her feelings about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in her critique.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We need FBI investigators right before the election".
According to the polls released on Thursday, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she will run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who "may not" say the legislator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
thirty-two percent supported such a contest.
The poll showed strong support for former Governor Deval Patrick's race, with 38 percent in favor of the race and 48 percent against.
Another prominent Democrat has spoken about the 2020 race, which includes former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont legislator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin has mentioned Track Palin's PTSD at a political rally for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his September recruitment.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic disturbance on Monday night.
"I can relate what my son is going through, what he's going through after he's back, to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at Donald Trump's political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her detention "the elephant in the room" and said of her and other returnees, "They came back a little bit different, they came back hard, they came back admiring their fellow soldiers and the Air Force, and all the other members of the armed forces, for the honor they have given to the country".
Wasilla police department spokesman dan bennett said he was arrested in wasilla, alaska, on monday and charged with domestic assault on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and carrying a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support the push for new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal pressure for a new U.S. policy that would ban asylum seekers from organized crime groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a court filing Friday in support of a asylum seeker challenging the policy in Washington, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, the American Civil Liberties Union, complains that their arguments against the federal policy in August were not made public.
She claims that her boyfriend and the sons of a violent organized crime group have been cruel to her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
arrested in texas.
Lawyers for the states, which support Grace, say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, are the countries that continue to face problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy has attracted the attention of the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision allowing unregistered immigrants to apply for asylum to escape domestic violence.
In a statement on friday, district attorney general carl resin said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be dealt with according to the facts and circumstances specific to the claim, and such a prohibition would violate that principle", said the court's legal counsel.
The lawyers also argued that the immigration ban would hurt the U.S. economy, providing a greater opportunity for entrepreneurs to be innovative and "essential power".
Attorney general Jeff Sessions orders immigration judges in June to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic violence and organized crime gangs.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their country of residence because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems -- even the worst problems that people face all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, with the number of deaths doubling in the race for survivors

U.S. ambassador accuses China of propaganda ads and threats.
A week after a four-page announcement of U.S.-China trade deals in mutual interests led to the publication of an official Chinese newspaper in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American publications for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump raises the issue of the de Moyne Register, the state's best-selling newspaper, including the Chinese Daily, on Wednesday after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marks the latest stage in Washington's growing campaign of pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common to issue advertisements to foreign governments to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a relentless trade war that has led to the imposition of roundabout tariffs on imports.
China's tariffs on grain at the dawn of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters who support Trump's Republican Party in states like Iowa, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, former longtime governor of Iowa, U.S. ambassador to China and a major exporter of agricultural products to China, says Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling down on that threat by publishing propaganda ads in our own independent publications", Bransstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday de Monet Regis.
To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the culture of free speech and free publishing that is protected by the United States by posting paid ads on the De Moyne Register, Bransstad writes.
"In comparison, the Beijing street newsstands and magazine stores are a limited vote of no confidence and do not reflect the true views of the Chinese people on China's troubled economic path, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
"One of the most popular newspapers in China has rejected his request to publish the article", he added, without specifying which newspaper.
Republicans are excluding women voters before the midterm due to Kavanaugh's fall, analysts warn
Despite questions raised by many Republicans that Attorney General candidate Brett Kavanaugh had been sexually assaulted, critics warn that his standing and defence will face negative responses, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around this is very high, and most republicans are clearly showing a willingness to push ahead with the vote.
"we can't turn back the past", grant richer, professor of political science at syracuse university maxwell school, told the hill on saturday.
Richer questions whether the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in an FBI investigation is enough to lure angry voters.
Women will not forget yesterday - nor will they forget tomorrow, Carine Jean Pierre, a former adviser and national spokeswoman for the Mov On movement, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters marched peacefully in front of the Senate floor, shouting "November is coming!" The Republican Legislative Translators Committee voted to push Kavanaugh's nomination despite the promise of testimony.
"The deep desire and motivation for democracy is about to disappear from the record board", Stu Rosenberg, a political analyst who is not a member of any political party, told NewsSite.
people are saying that it has already risen, and that is true.
But it can be especially prevalent among female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, who live in suburban areas and change their minds, even though they don't like the president very often.
Ford's testimony, which details the sexual assault charges against the attorney general, was publicly suggested by Republicans who pushed for a strong negative response from critics.
"This has become a cumulative problem for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the fact that Kavanaugh is in the chair, but the way Republicans have handled it and treated her", Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news site.
However, after the testimonies of ford and cavanagh, americans seem to be somewhat divided, sliding into the less usual.
A new yogow poll shows 41 percent of respondents believe ford's testimony to be either true or false, and 35 percent believe cavanagh to be true or false.
In addition, 38 percent believe Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, with only 30 percent saying the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the fbi is currently investigating charges brought by ford and at least one other case, deborah ramirez, the guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the senate legal interpretation committee last week that Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old while intoxicated.
Ramirez accuses the attorney general of exposing his penis to her face during a party while he was a Yale student in the 1980s.
The global web developer plans to launch a new internet to merge Google and Facebook.
Tim Barnes-Lee, the creator of the world wide web, is about to launch a new business model that seeks to merge Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Inrapt, is Barnes-Lynne's open source platform Solid, a company that is growing on top of what it already has.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to use which data.
In an interview with Fast Company alone, Barnes-Lee joked that the motive behind InRapt is "global domination".
"We have to work now", he said about the new business model.
 A historic moment. 
The implementation enables people to create their own personal online data storage or pod using Solid technology.
It may contain personal identification, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music museum, and other personal and professional tools.
Google drive, microsoft outlook, slack and spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
What makes a private internet data warehouse unique is the user's absolute choice of using any data.
The company calls this "data-driven self-empowerment".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrapt is to help make Soyd accessible to everyone by bringing the company's assets, processes and relevant know-how.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lynne, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, contracted employees and a community of volunteer software developers to build the project.
Starting this week, tech giants around the world can create standalone applications using tools on InRapt websites.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing whether or not to introduce a complete change to Facebook and Google to fully reflect their business model at the same time.
 We do not ask for their consent.
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Barnes-Lee writes that the mission of InRapt's is to provide the business power and ecosystem to help maintain the consistency and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology founded the World Wide Web Association, which revolutionized the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the free-to-play internet debate.
While launching InRapt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly excited for the next era". Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Priest of the Victoria Cross Awarded
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross for fighting in World War I has been given a 100 year honor in his home town.
The Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van was awarded the medal for his actions on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bellingham and the Battle of Leuchtencourt.
However, he never won the great British military honour, being killed by a sniper four days later.
The jewel was found by his two children in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One grandson, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" and the stone is being presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning adventure.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his army on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick rubber and under heavy field and automatic gun fire".
He quickly went to the field alone and after hitting three quarters, he rushed to the line of fire with "great heroism" and led the line forward.
Lieutenant Vann was shot by a German and killed on 24 September 1911 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael van, 72, said that his grandfather's action was "something I knew I could never have, but something of humility".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the military parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the military parade" and added "a real heroic adventure is being shown with the support of a large crowd".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of Peppa Pig
Think about it, they've been up all night looking at Bellator 206 together.
The San Jose bill contains 13 matches, including six on the main card and will be shown live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig, which surprised viewers in the UK.
some were not particularly happy about the match after staying up late.
One supporter on Twitter described the transformation into a children's cartoon as "a little unhealthy joke".
"At 6 a.m., that content is not appropriate and should be turned into a children's program, which is the government's policy", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", said Abbey.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will work to include UK viewers in their agenda.
"i think when i think about the answer, i think maybe we can fix it.
"But it's six o'clock this Sunday morning and we can't fix it until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when he was copying, there were a lot of posts going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, assuming it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a government matter.
i can promise you, it won't be the next time.
We're going to reduce it to five games instead of six - as we usually do - and try and get more for the fans.
"I was so sad.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'under' about sex
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but he was an inspiration to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize "that everyone was like him" until he entered high school.
The first 4 Desert Island Discs radio says that talking about gay rights gives "hope" to others
he also said that being a parent made him less worried about winning the olympics.
long-distance runner Kirsty Young takes months off due to illness.
After being fired from Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" than all the other teens because "love for both boys and girls was not acceptable in the community".
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and those feelings of being different, were the real things that gave me the strength and the strength to win".
He wants to make sure there was "something", so that gradually when they found out about his sexuality, he didn't upset everyone.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT contestant and will use his appearance to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He spoke publicly because he was frankly lucky to be able to live without a---- and because he wanted to give "hope" to others.
"I was shocked" by the three-time world champion falling in love with the man he met in 2013 - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley, who married his 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, said the age gap has never been controversial.
"To go through all this at such a young age" - he attended his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, "it was hard to find someone of the same age who had the same fate".
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black in May, Daley, and Daley "has a whole new look".
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said, 'I want a gold medal.'"
"you know, there are bigger things than an olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
his son, robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40, shares his name.
Daley refused to accept that his father was dying and one of the last things he asked for - because he wanted to be the front-runner - was that they had their tickets to London 2012.
"i couldn't tell my dad that he wasn't going to live with us to be a front man", he says.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I finally made sure he wasn't overcome", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2010 Olympics and won bronze.
"but i knew that this age was not my measure: to swim in the olympic games in front of a crowd of fans, there is no better feeling", he said.
He also sparked his first musical choice - Proud - in the preparation for the Olympics with Heather Small, and it still resonates.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's position changed at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets the record for the 47th Ryder Cup race on Sunday, but he changed his stance to avoid any unpleasantness.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, was replaced by Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-on-four match.
Instead of being a flash in the pan, as he was for the United States, the five-time winner split his time between supporting and preparing himself for the game in an attempt to relieve his stress.
Even those who have never won will not reach the tower he reached during his playing days, the 48-year-old's body is not suitable for the difficult and untamed comfort of the Le Golf National Stadium.
And if the field itself isn't enough to disappoint, for the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson will face strong British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who this week formed a partnership with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games.
the americans, who started 12 separate games down by 4 points, could prove their worth if they didn't start with a strong offense, mckelson's performance.
Furyk expressed his confidence in himself, not saying much more.
"He fully understands his role now, he will be ready for tomorrow after he hits me on the back and puts his arm on me", Furyk said.
"he has a strong sense of self.
He's fantastic, he added a lot of stuff to the team last year, and this week.
I didn't think it would add two games by chance.
I thought a lot, but it's just the way it is and we thought we should go that way.
like everyone else, he wants to be there".
Mickelson surpasses Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder games played on Sunday.
He never fits the profile, and his Ryder Cup performance could mark the end of his playing days.
Mickelson has won 18 times, drawn 20 times and drawn 7 times, but his presence has brought unimaginable things to the team, Furyk said.
"He's funny, he's provocative, he's funny, he makes people laugh, and it's great to have him in the group room", he explained.
"The young players are excited to play emotionally with him this week, it's sad to see that.
"it gives more than just a game".
Europe's lighthouse Thomas Bjorn knows that the diversity of leadership will soon disappear
Europe's champion Thomas Bjorn learns from experience that when he reaches the final day of the Ryder Cup singles match, he can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut for Valderrama in 1997, with the then-leading Seve Ballesteros five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually won the game by a narrow margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Remember yourself that we were leading wide at Valderrama, and if we lost, we were leading wide at Brookline, and we won at Valderrama for a little bit", said Bjorn, after watching him defeat the 2018 graduates 5-3 on Friday and lead the National Le Golf yesterday.
so the story is that for me and for the rest of the team, it's not over.
tomorrow you will do your best.
go out there and do all the right things.
the story is not over until you find the numbers on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the cup, and the focus is there.
I said it all together - I'm focusing on our 12 players, but we also know very well that there are some of the world's greatest players on the other side".
Enchanted by the players' performance in the tough golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I never benefited myself from this.
tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is the day of individual competence, and that is something different to do.
When things are going well, it's great to be with a partner, but when you're there alone, you're playing your golf to your full potential.
That's the message to all players, be your best tomorrow.
now, leave your partner behind, let him go, and so on, show his best qualities. "
Unlike Bjorn, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points from four, Jim Furyk expects the players to perform better individually than they did collectively.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the great changes, eventually losing in Brooklyn when Europe raised the "Miracle in Medina".
I remember every word, said Ben Crenshaw in 1999, in response to a question about how he had assembled the players to go to the end of the day.
"tomorrow we have 12 crucial matches, but you better get rid of that fast start, like you saw in brookline, like you saw in medinah.
When the earthquake goes in one direction, only the half-match is pressurized.
We organized our march accordingly and put the people in a position where, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas was given the chance to try to lead the replay and faced Rory McIlroy in the senior match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the top half, respectively.
"I went with this group walk in this order because I thought it would cover up", Bjorn said on his single choice.
The new German battleship is extended again
The German Navy's fastest warship was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era battleship, but due to broken systems and rising costs, it won't be until at least next year, local media reported.
"Rheinland-Pfalz", the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast battleship, has been extended to mid-2019, according to a military spokesman for Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was to join the navy in 2004, but the difficult post-contract issue has complicated the project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class fast battleships.
It is known to have a powerful weaponry, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile capability, and certain stealth technology such as mini radar, red light bulbs and sound signatures.
Another important feature includes a long maintenance period: the new fast battleship should be able to be deployed up to two years away from the home port.
However, the continuous delays mean that the ships - which Germany has refused to allow to refer to overseas powers - will be obsolete by the time they begin service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 fast battleship made headlines last year when German naval authorities banned the ship from use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
this was the first time the navy had returned a ship to a developer since it was delivered.
The reason for the delay is not known, but German media cited critical "software and hardware flaws" that would render the ship useless if deployed in combat.
The lack of software was particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could be built with 120 sailors, half the manpower required by the old Bremen class fast battleships.
In the end, the ship proved to be incredibly heavy, which reduced its efficiency and limited its ability to further upgrade the navy.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the German-built ship of the same type used in World War II.
Aside from the broken hardware, the overall cost of the project - including training for the sailors - is becoming a concern.
It is said to have risen from €2.2 billion to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The challenges surrounding the new fast battleship have become important, especially with the recent warning of a reduction in German naval capacity.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defense committee, announced that the navy was indeed "running out of submarine-capable ships".
The official said the case has been steadily increasing, as old ships have been decommissioned but no replacement ships have been provided.
he said with regret that no baden-werttemberg-class fast battleships could join the navy.
National Secret Listening Trust on the secret life of birds every night
new research is underway in the scottish highlands to explain how night owls use the landscape for their food.
The discovery is believed to shed new light on the unique behavior of the flying mammal and could lead to future conservation efforts.
The common and loud pipistrelles and the brown long-eared and the Daubenton nightingale are followed by those in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross, by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland.
special recorders are placed around key areas to monitor nocturnal activity during the general season.
NHS staff and volunteers conduct mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
Professional sound analysis of all sound records confirms the call repeated by the nightingale and what species is doing.
A map of the life cycle and a report are prepared to create a detailed geomorphological picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which ecological habitat is most important for night owls and which species are being exploited.
This information will help to identify the benefits of conservation work such as greenfield work and better protection of forests for nocturnal birds and related species.
Over the last century, the number of night owls has declined dramatically in Scotland and across the UK.
The destruction of the cottages and the life of the cottage is in danger due to construction and development.
Wind turbines and lightning can pose a risk, as can flying paper and certain building materials, chemicals, and stray cats.
birds of the night are not blind.
however, because of their hunter-gatherer skills, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting for food.
the sophisticated method of detecting insects or identifying obstacles in flight is used.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 protected lands around Harare, takes night owls seriously.
There are ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary, home to eight of the ten species of bats, even in Threave estate Dumfries and Galloway.
The estate manager David Thompson said the estate was a suitable state for them.
"this is a good place for night birds in threave", he said.
We have old buildings, old trees and all good zoos.
but there is much unknown about night owls, so our work here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stressed the need to check for night owls before repairing properties, saying that the accidental destruction of a single parent nest could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly the entire population.
night birds are friendly and it is a crime to kill, attack or disturb them or to take away their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Nightbird Conservation officer, urged the public to come to the aid.
"we still have a lot to learn about our night owls, and I don't know what the numbers are for most of our species. "
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyer prepares to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyers are set to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which published the indictment.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker, Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, is accused of raping in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
She was then reportedly paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the encounter, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video to his 142 million followers on Instagram hours after the announcement, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news".
"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what is that is the way that is the way to do.
Today's news, fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"they want to make themselves known by using my name.
It is common
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, "Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel in the case against Ronaldo, which they call an unacceptable libel".
"The player seeks compensation for the seriousness of the moral damage caused by the recent violation of the most serious of individual rights in connection with the breach of contract", says lawyer Christian Schertz.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel Room and Las Vegas Casino.
According to documents filed in the Clark County Court of Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly walked through the front door of the room where he was allegedly stabbed.
After the trial, Ronaldo got down on his knees and told me that he was "99 percent" a "good man" and that he had fallen to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but also that he had consented
Mayorga also said that she went with the police and had photos taken at the hospital about her injuries, but finally agreed to an out-of-court settlement "for fear of reprisals" and "to avoid public humiliation".
The 34-year-old is facing a lawsuit and is still mentally disturbed and wants to break the agreement
He was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United when the attack was alleged, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'may regret it forever' for losing its car manufacturers
If the UK loses its world's leading carmaker after Brexit, it 'could regret it forever', says UK Trade Bureau chief Greg Clark
Toyota UK added that it was "concerning" to tell the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant in Derby.
"We want a deal", said Mr. Clark.
Japanese carmakers say delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could have the effect of losing jobs
Burnaston, the factory that produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, shipped 90% of the 150,000 cars it produced last year to the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of April, production will stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about how cross-border business would work if the EU left without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is closing its small factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit
Car manufacturers say their main concern is the potential for supply chain disruption
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, so orders for cars are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 April without a deal, it could violate border rules, leading to delays and shortening of shipments, industry says
At the Derbyshire plant, it was impossible for Toyota to overload and production could stop, the company said.
"The plan of Theresa May's palace is to integrate exactly to eliminate border checks", Clark said of the future relationship with the EU.
"we need an agreement. i would say that we should be happy not only with the opportunity, but with the success we have now, so we need an agreement that will bring this about", he said on bbc radio 4 today.
"we want to continue the supply chain that has been very efficient, as can be proven not only from toyota but also from other manufacturers".
Toyota could not say how long it would stop production, but warned that the increased cost could reduce the factory's competitiveness and the jobs it created over the long term.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the Unit Association at the factory, said that the members were very concerned: "As far as I know, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
"We have made a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU", the government spokesman said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein has been rescheduled, says White House
Donald Trump told the White House on Sunday that his highly profitable meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week because of the ongoing conflict with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein will oversee the work of her special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump's aid and Russian interference, and the president's obstruction of justice.
Trump threatened Mueller's freedom, and the deputy attorney general fired him, but not him, a rumor that has been circulating in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was wired to record his conversation with Trump and that the president could be removed by the 25th amendment.
rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, the White House reported that he was gone, due to be released in mid-June.
Instead, he will meet with Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid potential conflict with lawmakers in the Senate, confirmed by Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment.
On friday, at the request of kavaugh, trump ordered an fbi investigation for a week, with the participation of all members of the legislative council to delay.
Trump's chief information officer Sarah Sanders is featured on Fox News Sunday.
asked about the rosenstein meeting, she said: "it is not set for that date, it could be this week, it could be postponed to another week as things are going on at the supreme court.
But we will see and I always want to inform the media when there is something new".
Some reporters may test that confirmation: Sanders did not issue a White House press release after September 10.
Editor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of statements was not "attractive" because she hated TV reporters, but she said, "I agree with the fact that they are attractive".
then she made a comment about the direct link between trump and the media.
citing no evidence, she added, "the president has held more Q&A sessions than any president before him. we have seen those numbers".
statements will be made in the future, Sanders said, "but if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the united states questions directly, that's better than talking to me".
We're trying very hard to do that and you've seen us doing that a lot over the last few weeks and when you get to speak to the president of the United States, that becomes part of the press release".
Trump always receives questions when he visits the White House or attends open meetings or leaves a public meeting with high-profile guests.
There are few press conferences.
This week in New York, the president is seen in a disheveled state, powerless and with reporters showing a confused face before a rally.
Health spokesman writes about Brexit fears for EU staff at Scotland NHS
The health spokesperson thanked EU staff at the Scottish NHS and wrote to continue their work post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter to the UK to leave the EU in less than six months.
The Scottish government is committed to meeting the costs of living conditions indicators for citizens working in public services for the EU.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are ongoing, leading to a decision expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also halting preparations for a possible disagreement.
i know you're going through a very unstable time for all of us.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much I value the contribution of each of the members of the task force, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from across the EU, and beyond, have brought valuable experience and expertise that will strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and advance the patient and the community.
Scotland is your true home and we want you to stay very much".
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the corner line and he was about to fall", Reed explained.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the line of fire before she was taken to a hospital for further testing.
Tennessee state officials told chris harris that wsmv has been discharged from surgery at vanderbilt medical center in nashville, tennessee, abercrombie.
Harris also said that "there is no detail on the type/size of the damage" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before the game, adding 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when purchasing property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The movement undermines Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The fund is expected to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - the extra money will go to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters by promising affordable housing and targeting those with higher incomes.
The increased stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and organisations who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money helping the government to fight the road sleeper.
The higher fee than usual - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let - could be as high as 3 percent.
The bank expects its activity to rise to £120 million.
About 13 per cent of London's newly built housing has been purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot on the housing ladder.
Due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad, many of the richest areas in the country - especially the capital - have become "spirit cities".
The new guidelines come two weeks after Boris Johnson offered to ease the stamp duty on many young residents to have their own homes.
He blamed large construction firms for not taking up the land and raising house prices, and urged Mrs May to leave a stake in affordable housing to correct Britain's "degrading housing practices".
Mr Corbyn has introduced a series of eye-catching planned housing reforms, including rent controls and "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more authority to build new houses.
"I said last year that I would step down as prime minister to restore the British dream - that life should be better for all generations", she said.
And it means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and start a new life here.
However, it is not true that it is easier to buy a house for hardworking British residents, non-UK residents, and foreign companies.
For many people, home ownership was a distant dream, and the glorious street sleeping remained a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "last wish" is to coach Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, is enjoying a struggle to revitalise the North-East team, which is currently three points behind the top of League One.
After leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season, he moved to the Light Stadium this summer.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got the B Cup, it's over", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Voice.
As a child, I grew up watching a lot of Hampden, Scotland with my dad, and he always said something that brought me back.
This opportunity can come if I am successful in team management.
Ross' replacements as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of alloa athletic said that his reputation, which was built after his previous spells at barnsley and ipswich city, would not be a cause for concern in such a large club.
"For me, success is measured by 'can I get this team back to the Premier League?'
"Due to the structure and supply of this team, it will undoubtedly be included in the Premier League".
"it's not easy to deliver, but i can only see myself as successful if i can bring the team back".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career, after a spell as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month coaching stint at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa climb from the bottom to third, and converted St Mirren from the bottom to the winner's title the following season.
Ross said he was now more satisfied with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Maybe it was the right crossing", recalls Alloa, who took over.
I sincerely believe that coaching is the right fit for me, rather than just playing.
It seems confusing because I'm well aged, I've made a reasonable living, and I've achieved some reasonable heights.
but it can be difficult to play.
you have a lot to go over each week.
Again, I've been through the stress and pressure of the job, but training is a sense of authenticity.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever had, having spent my entire adult life on my own".

The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for struggling British liquor stores but put more pressure on restaurants.
Drinking establishments Bar groups showed 2.7% sales growth in July but restaurant revenue was down 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA's business adviser who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's expected extended World Cup involvement means that July followed the same frequency of events as the previous June, except that when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, restaurants were more hit.
The number of restaurants in the country fell by 1.8% in June, compared to a slight decline in July.
"drinking bars and bars showed more robust growth than restaurants that fell.
food-focused liquor stores, though not as shocking as restaurant operators, have also been hit hard.
people seem to go out just to get a drink.
"Beverage sales in well-run liquor stores were up 6.6 percent for the month, food down three percent".
"These results will continue to be in the form we have seen since the end of April", said RSM Paul Newman, a leisure use and hospitality analyst.
W The impact of weather and major social or sporting events remains the biggest influences when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but the 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales is especially bad in addition to the increasing price pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-oriented business operators and the time we spent in August tells us that the more moderate temperatures will give us a few of the much-needed short periods of relief".
T overall sales growth was 2.7 percent in July, including newly opened liquor stores and restaurants, reflecting a slowdown in the process of launching new services

An ad for a breast-feeding device that compares mothers to cows is spreading opinion on the Internet
An advertisement comparing milkshake products to cows has sparked a viral Internet advert
In connection with the launch of what is being called the "world's first silent wearable breastfeeding device", the consumer technology company LV has announced the creation of a music video that captures the freedom that the new breastfeeding device gives to mothers who express themselves.
Four real mothers singing a single song with such a poem in a jar full of jelly, "I say yes, but you can't see me, you can't see me", and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't cow breasts, they're my breasts".
"put it out", the snake continues, "put it out, I am feeding my children, put it out, put it out, I am feeding my daughters.
However, the announcement posted on the organization's facebook page sparked a controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of messages, the video received mixed reactions, many of whom said that animal impersonation "has devastated" the industry and is growing exponentially.
"it is a very low decision to use the children to promote this product.
they must grow old and give birth like us, to give milk, unless they are stolen within a few days of birth.
The LV breast milk tube is placed in the caregiver's breast container (LV/mother) without warning.
another commented: "it is so disturbing to both mother and baby that they can understand it.
But why don't we use them to promote breast milk to mothers who have to take care of their babies?"
Another added: "such a sophisticated advertisement"
Others defended the ad, believing that one woman found the single "too funny"
"i think this is a great idea.
I would have one if I was still breastfeeding.
drinking made me feel like a cow.
The ad is somewhat unemotional, but I took it as it was meant to be.
"This is a premium product", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a ridiculous advertisement aimed at mothers who use the toilet (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "snakes".
This is not a commercial that is either good or bad for the animal comedy industry".
At the end of the video, the women's group announced that they were all cheering, and they were smashing the unidentified ticks from under their nipples.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who use the breast pump will feel like cows.
However, the LV nozzle is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is unintentionally positioned under the caretaker's breastplate, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and go outside using the nozzle.
Anna ballarin, founder of mazer and icd, commented: "the lv drink is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and angry start.
We wanted to bring the practice of breastfeeding and all its evils into the public eye by drawing a parallel line between the self-expressing women and the dairy cows, and then in a fun and engaging way to showcase the incredible freedom that the new breastfeeding experience brings.
When the elbow is holding the front pages, it is time to start.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the stage of designer Martha Jakabovsky's fashion show wearing the brand.
hundreds of refugee children are quietly moved to a tent camp on the texas border.
The number of detained refugee children has reached a peak, but monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's aggressive rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult to accept children with disabilities.
As a matter of practice, most of the widows are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear that when they are approached to request adoption, their ability to stay in the country will be jeopardized.
In June, the concern increased when federal officials announced that potential hostages and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, former immigration and customs officer matthew albenz testified that the agency had detained more than a dozen people who had applied to be the sole surrogates for the underage children.
the agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are fugitives or members of the fugitives' families have entered this country illegally, and most of those are criminals from other worlds.
so we continue to track these individuals".
According to shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process, the authorities introduced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of their imprisonment, rather than the usual 60 days.
many will appeal their case to an immigration judge for legal status via videoconference call rather than in person.
Those who are considered not to meet the requirements are quickly deported from the point of view of eliminating threats.
According to reports from shelter and the center in recent months, prolonged incarceration of children increases their risk of depression or grief, leading to attempts to release and escape the emotions of the force.
advocates say that such concerns are being raised in places as large as tornillo where the child who struggles because of his size shows more signs of being ignored.
They add that letting children move to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can only exacerbate the frustration many are struggling with.
Syria urges the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to leave immediately
Speaking to the TAMC General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mo'alem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
moahlem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be dealt with appropriately.
"They must be released immediately and unconditionally", he told the audience.
Moahlem insists that the war on terror is over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and more than a million have been displaced since 2011.
Damascus says it will continue to fight this holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign entity.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 infantry in the war-torn country.
He said that the situation for refugees is good for them to return and accused some western countries of spreading unjustified fears that prevented the return of refugees.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the response challenges", he said.
"You're giving it a political face that should be a humanitarian issue"
The United States and the European Union warn that no reconstruction aid will be given until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
MAD diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a free peace zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has provided an opportunity to pressure for political talks to move forward.

money flows like a flood from the council race to the well-organized midterm elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th saw a huge amount of money, thanks to congressional districts returning to their former places, which put two no-seats in the race for the one-seat band.
This recently reorganized suburb of pittsburgh puts in the race democrat congressman connor lamb, who won another district seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican incumbent Case Rothfuss, who is currently representing the new 17th district, which covers much of Pennsylvania's former 12th district.
The maps were redrawn after the pennsylvania supreme court ruled in january that the previous districts had changed their boundaries to favor republicans, in violation of the constitution.
The new 17th campaign fundraiser has seen intense competition between the major party funders, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and The National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC), which has suddenly erupted.
Lamb is a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a special election in March for Pennsylvania's widely-represented 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.

In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm relationship with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until the coalition's founders fired the Trump Organization management team.
State department officials decided to call off the heads of the american diplomatic missions from el salvador, the dominican republic, panama, and taiwan because of their decision not to recognize taiwan, heather north, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties are intended only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid for development and economic aid, including drug control, in 2017.
The reduction of financial aid and the increased visa restrictions targeted by advisory penalties will cause the Central American country to suffer from high unemployment and suicide rates.
While internal meetings have shown improvement, North and Central American officials have postponed the summit of senior officials focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year, which was supposed to have been a step back from efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-september, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to be postponed, and that any sanctions against El Salvador would be effectively abandoned.
Vice president mike pence has now been selected to address the conference scheduled for mid-october, indicating the administration's unclear interpretation of the rally.

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers looks hopeful ahead of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, believing a win over Austria in the wake of a sensational draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a strong position to advance from Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making the opening appearance of the season until the game was tied 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard into bigger things.
"I had a good point because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"we entered the tournament believing we would get something and came out with one point.
Maybe we could have put it in the end, but overall, a peer-review, maybe a good one.

although the respondents clearly understood how they wanted to be cared for, few of them had spoken to their family members about it.
In a global survey, nearly half of respondents said they discussed long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they are not taking the necessary steps to do so", said Holly Snyder, CEO of Global Life Insurance Business.
It starts here:
Talk to your spouse and children about it. If you don't prepare in advance what you want, you won't be able to plan how your family will take care of you in the future.
Discuss with your counselor where and how you will receive care, as these options will help you to measure the costs.
Bring your financial advisor. Your advisor can help you find a way to get money for payments.
For long-term care fund options, the traditional long-term care insurance policy may include a mixed-money-payment life insurance policy to cover these expenses, or a self-insurance policy to keep your own assets as long as you have the money.
Confirm your legal documents. Keep legal disputes from going too far
If you are unable to communicate, prepare a health-care document for the person you choose to monitor the medical care process and for the professionals to meet your needs according to your specifications.
Also, get a lawyer for your finances.

The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, a tsunami and earthquake hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing up to 384 people and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communication was disrupted by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the central city of Donggala Region, north of Palu, and the relevant authorities were unable to obtain any information.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been displaced by natural disasters.
The following are facts about the islands of suluwesi:
Palu is the centre of the Sulawesi region, located on the narrow western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800.

The administration, which is under the state administration, estimates the population to reach 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the Central Sulawesi region, especially the Dongola Bay area, is based on fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is another important industry in the region, but the largest deposits are in Morowali, opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Dongola have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed 200 people in Dongola and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami killed nine people in West Dingala.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, which is a region that is normally prone to earthquakes.

2016: The devastating earthquake that hit the PDI Jayas, a part of the Aceh region, reminds the people of the devastating damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis occurred during this period, but 100 people died in collapsed buildings.

Federal investigators are calling for the death penalty for suspected terrorists in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, the terrorist who killed eight people: a special sentence that has not been imposed on federal criminals since 1953.
Sipov, 30, committed the crime in October using a rented house car on Lower Manhattan's West Side Bicycle Highway, injuring cyclists and pedestrians on the road.
According to the Southern New York State Death Penalty Appeal, in order to receive the death penalty, investigators must prove that Szipow intended to cause "serious bodily harm" by "implying" the act.
Both cases are capable of death sentences according to court documents.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court charged Saipov with 22 counts of commonly used in organized crime, eight counts of manslaughter and violation of motor vehicle laws and causing injury.
The investigator said the attack "requires long-term planning and preparation", describing Sapiov as "extremely cruel and prejudiced".
The case document states that "Sifulo Habillevich Saipov has caused death and injury to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicolas Clevs, Heran Ferrucci, Heran Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Puginko".
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
it's been ten years since the southern state of new york last held a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a new york federal case was handed down in 1953 to jules and ethel rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to death two years earlier for helping to leak information to the soviet union during the cold war.
Both rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on july 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek national, Saipow, did not feel remorse in the final days of the attack.
According to police, he said he had no regrets about his work and felt good.
Sapoev told investigators that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching videos of the ISIS terrorist group on his phone.
police, in the hospital room, asked me to hang an ISIS terrorist group flag.
he pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the crime.
federal public prosecutor david paton, who represents saipov, said he was "deeply saddened" by the verdict.
Patton said that asking for the death penalty would be an extension of mental distress for anyone involved in the process rather than a life sentence with no possibility of parole.
saipov's defense team asked his lawyers to stop him from seeking the death penalty.
Tory MPs call for Nigel Farage to take charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage chooses to "move the people's army" during the Tory protest conference.
Former UKIP leader Blinken suggested that one of Theresa May's MPs take charge of EU negotiations, as politicians are eager to hear the heat from Aerospace.
If Mr Farage is the Brexit secretary, the UK would still be leaving, says Conservative Peter Bone, March Burningham.
Mrs may's challenge, however, is to reconcile the divided levels in depth, as opposed to the mayor torioch, who joined the protest against the city's brexit.
The key is to try to get the checkers to agree on the Brexit, the rest and the EU's anti-terrorism plan.
The coalition said it would push for a deal with Brussels, in contrast to the failed plan, and force Eurosceptics and the workers to choose between it and the crisis.
Mr. Bonné said the resignation meant leaving the group in Solihull to check the checks.
Mr. Frej suggested that he pay attention and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we would have left at this hour,' he said.
Wellinborough MP added: Brexit is a good thing for Chuck Cheekers.
He opposed the A.A. He said that we did not participate in the world war.
We must make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone has destroyed the public opinion that has changed since the 2016 election.
Tory Brexit leader Andre Jenkins, who was not present in November, told reporters: "I'm simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people".
The chequers are not popular among the people, the opposition does not choose them, this is not known, our party and activists make us the first to be elected.
please leave the checkers and listen.
A message to Mr. May, he added: "The Prime Minister keeps his job by keeping his word".
Mr. Farage told politicians that they should feel the heat if they want to win the 2016 referendum.
This is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political party.
they are going to betray brexit and we are going to tell them today: we will not let them do this.
He added: "I want you to change our part of politics, to betray the people of Rexit, to feel the heat".
"We are gathering the people's activists in this city who have won for Brexit, we will not rest until we are self-sufficient, self-managed, proud of the United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the remaining protesters have been marching in Burningham for two hours before being stopped in the city centre.
Activists' cries have led to Tory Brexit banners being erected this week after the group was disbanded.
The power-sharing lord adonis mocked the conservatives over the security issue, and they became worried that the conference had just begun.
"These people are the ones who can have the IT system in place and all the technology in Canada, because of the border-free, border-free trade", he added.
 It is a complete joke.
There is nothing better than brexit, he added.

President Trump mocks Senator Diane Fenton at a political community meeting on Saturday, who refused to release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in a Supreme Court case against Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify in Ford's address, but in front of a Senate committee, he told the public what was happening in the Senate was "mean and ugly and unbelievable".
something that can be created and beautiful will stay in the senate for a few days, when you see the anger, when you see the angry man and the average and the ugly and the unbelievable.
when you see the ones who are released and come out and they say, wow, i didn't do it.
I did not.
What is the result?
Dianne Festen, did you find out?
Remember her answer... You've exposed the document - Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not.
Okay, wait a minute.
We threw it out... no, we didn't", he added, drawing the senator's attention.
Kavanaugh was charged with failing to provide evidence in a letter sent to Fenton in February, and now recently in May - but Fenton denied leaving her office.
I didn't hide it. Ford's case, I didn't make the story public, Fenton told the committee, The Hill reported.
she asked me to keep it secret, and i kept it secret.
Her denial was not presented to the president, who suggested at the Saturday evening meeting: "I'll tell you what, that's bad human language".
What she may not have done, but what I saw was the ugly language of her hearing.
The Supreme Court debate continues, with three women accused of sexual assault, the president said, and Democrats are filing charges to their own end.
they are determined to take power again in no uncertain way.
You see the average, the ugly, it's not about who gets hurt, it's about who they have to control to get power, think about the president's statement.

The couple denied being racist, and the full dress is "powerfully done".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she found a new babysitter, Gisele Morris, a black woman, when she first went to work in 2016.
"No other black man can be a black man" is what Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, she sent it to her husband, Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she found out, she fired her manager, Mrs. Rit Morris, who was a Plasco-Flaxman, citing Nancy, an African-American who was going to leave, and took a job as a waitress, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Morris was paid for a job and sent home for Uber.
Now, Morris is dismissing the charges of bribery, and he's trying to deny that he was first hired there when he was in gigs for six months, out of contract.
They want to show them, look, you don't do that kind of thing, they know that there is an announcement on Sunday, I add that it is Madello.
The couple responded with what they considered to be racist remarks, explaining that it was reasonable to leave Maurice's job, because they could not believe him after talking to him.

Paddington publishers feared readers would compare it to a talking bear, a new myth has been revealed
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, was born after the book was accepted, and the letter says: "It is difficult to put yourself in other tigers' shoes before it is published".
It is a thrill to learn about the Paddington's great success.
Her father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about Little Bear, said he was not discouraged by the rejection of his work, adding that he was "excited" about the book being published a year after his death.
Paddington, the family's most important figure, added that he was happy about the final achievement.
He was a gentle man, and not arrogant, she said.
But because Paddington is real to him, having this kid means you're going to accomplish something, even if it's not your job, and you're proud of them.
I think that's how they saw the success of Paddington.
Despite his invention and idea, Paddington is always praised.
My daughter is dying and I can call her.
The girl was rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors are working hard to save her life.
She called to say that she was very bad, she was not expected to do so, said Mr. Ednan LaPeros.
She was able to contact Nad and tell her that she would die in a few minutes.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, you are very sweet, my dear".
i will be with kanchi soon.
i will be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to regulate her heartbeat is gradually coming out and her system is releasing it.
she died some time before him and this is the end.
I have to sit here and wait, knowing this is revelation.
I didn't cry or cry, I was surrounded by my family and people.
i really need to get together.
Ednan-Laperos, now grieving for the loss of her son, was on the plane with other passengers but forgotten.
"no one knows, "she said.
I lowered my head, and the snow always flowed.
It's hard to explain, but it was on a plane when this terrible feeling hit Nad.

Tyler, the son of Mr. Rhett Davis, suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want my family to think the way I always think", she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 1, from Leiden, says her son is a dedicated chef with an infectious green.
Everyone knows him for his smile.

Brett Kavanaugh's future will be determined by the results of an FBI investigation.
"If we can find something like what I think he asked for - the study is limited in time and is limited in scope - we need to bring a little bit of unity", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was "diverse".
why did mr. cavanaugh and his republican supporters want the fbi to stop the investigation.
The secret of their staying together is in terms of time.
With only five weeks left in the midterm elections, expected in June, Republicans are still working hard, weakening in their trials, and finding the man they want to be elected as the leader of the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up his phone to call the senators, to influence the vote in favor of Kavanaugh, who was working for Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife, Achleen, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the results?
There will be elections in the senate, where 51 republicans and 49 democrats are currently seated.
Mr. Kavanaugh's win on the Senate floor in a narrow election is questionable, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the jail and confirm the Supreme Court.
North Korean destroyer numbers fell under Kim
Several North Korean fighter jets have fallen to South Korea, seven years before Kim Jong-un came to power, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byung-siug, the Southern Union Data Ministry, said there were 1,127 pollution incidents since last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the highest-ranking defendants in the narrow North Korea and China jurisdictions are the contraband dealers.
Pyongyang did not give any public comment.
Many North Koreans have acquired South Korean citizenship from defectors.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 South Koreans have been crossing the border illegally since the war in 1953.
Many flights pass through China, the longest border with China and Korea, and this is very easy with the most hidden military DMZ of the two Koreas.
China is forcing these defectors back to their homeland, not as refugees, but as illegal travelers.
The relationship between the south and the north - both of which are at war by profession - has changed in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss the elimination of nuclear power.
This comes after the historic visit of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un to Singapore in February, who also agreed to create a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US law enforcement for the move.
"There is no trust in the US, there is no confidence in our national security, there is no reason to disarm ourselves first", Ri told the General Assembly in New York.
Nancy pelosi called brett cavanaugh "historical", he is unfit to serve on the supreme court.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
I can't help but think that if she did, it would be "hysterical", Pelosi testified about Kavanaugh's actions before a Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were children.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was emotional, screaming and distraught as he discussed his family and his high school years.
Democrats in the committee blamed him for the "depiction and assassination" of Hillary Clinton, which was orchestrated by angry liberals who were angry that she did not run in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony, arguing that he should not serve on the Supreme Court because he put pressure on Democrats.
"I think he isolated himself from the Clintons and Democrats with these speeches", she said.
Pelosi is unable to speak when Kavanaugh is asked to step down, and Democrats have the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm saying that if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's there now to stand trial", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Democrats were concerned about Kavanaugh's ability to govern in a difficult, fair-minded manner.
he confirmed from his hearing that cavanaugh was asking for a copy of some of the high court decisions.
"It's not hysterical, the suspect is expected to go to court and say, 'It's not that good,'" Pelosi said.
And women should practice it.
this is a fair speech, months and years have passed, and she can't find it without crying.
we are angry and we cry, and the WRIT STENNAM is still alive after 45 years.
"I don't think you know, do you?"
She continued, "I have helped a woman who was an executive somewhere, who cried when she was crying, but she was a genius, and when she started crying, you would think to the person she was talking to, 'I'm crying because I'm crying.'
I'm not sure what to do.
And she went on.
And I thought this was good.
you can be angry because you didn't help these people from the beginning.
I have a memory from my past jobs, in a male-dominated office, of finding myself crying, a big woman holding me with a scarf around my neck - a cold manager who always pulled me slowly up the steps.
"I'll never see you again", he told her.
they will never know you.
they think you are sad and are happy that they came to see you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gray Hart on the presidential race.
In , Mr. Hart also discussed the issue of marriage abroad in a business called the boat duck and with the race over, Mrs. Schroeder, so frightened, knew that there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.

She was late to the campaign, she was with the fundraiser, and she said she would not run until she had $2 million.
the field of defeat.
he found out that her supporters gave the men $1,000, but she only gave him $250.
do you think they found you? " she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start the usual campaign, she was emotionally drained - you deserve all the praise I have for supporting you, fear of the system, so it is difficult to raise money and get voters from outside the representation, and they are angry about the sex abuse - that is what motivated her.
"You think I'm hurt, " she called Schroeder again to ask how the printers were.
you think that clenex is my co-sponsor.
I remembered this thought, what do you put on the power?
she cried?
how a US-China trade war is good for Beijing.
The opening of the trade war between China and the US, and the dismantling of the filming grounds, are Beijing's long-term plans, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning this year of tariffs on crucial Chinese exports of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The new wave this week has hit goods worth $200 billion, exactly half of which came from the US to China.
Beijing has always been a trade, most recently with the increase in tariffs from five to ten cents on US$60 billion of goods.
China has vowed to beat the US and transform the world's second largest economy soon.

Still, experts say that if Jing can play it right, the US arms trade pressure will effectively help China in a long-term plan to reduce the economic ties between the two countries.
"The real quick political decisions are worse than when Washington or Beijing is hurting their country's economy", says Abigail Grace, the study's Asia focused fellow at the Center for American Security, I think.
