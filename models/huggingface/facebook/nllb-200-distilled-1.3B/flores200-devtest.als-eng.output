This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a well-known theory, but provides details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional representation.
According to scientists, the animal had brown feathers on its upper body and pale or carotenoid feathers on its lower body.
This discovery also gives us a glimpse into the evolution of bird pupils.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft called the rachis, but shared with the structure of today's feathers other features, such as spines and barbels, researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or for appearance. Researchers believe that the example shows a full-grown feather, not a bird's beak, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
The researchers felt that although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen showed an adult feather and not a small bird's beak.

The work done was more theoretical, although the program was designed to simulate observations made over the Arrow Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by the attractive forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the earth and causes the earth to tremble, so the Milky Way exerts gravitational pull on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy lies around the galaxy in a halo shape and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Molly thinks, and at least two were hospital health workers.

The government has also promised several million vials of the anti-encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for the year after.
Plans to distribute vaccines to historically hard-hit areas were delayed this year, due to lack of funding and a lower priority given to it compared to other diseases.

Infrared images show that temperature fluctuations at night and day indicate the possible existence of caves.
They are cooler than their surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: voters self-isolate in a booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper in which they determine the chosen candidate.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law strictly regulates the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be clearly visible so that voters and observers can prove that there are no envelopes in them before voting begins and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process.

The road at the scene of the crash was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused of killing her son in the Court of First Instance in Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting admission of guilt and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be corrupted because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice found in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have considered the publication of the photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path if they publish photographs, etc., of suspects".
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for all criminal prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is announced.
The document will reportedly address the opposition to the borders that Palestine wants according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are thought to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, pending the signing of this agreement, demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The cats had to be closely monitored by the guards during the additional pest control trial, after which the trial was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Fishing Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Fishing Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director for Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extensive instructions on their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Interim Electoral Council for Martel in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 equipment-related accidents.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that Apple had reported 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (Friday at 09:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no injuries were reported on the scene.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the elderly children, were released first, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Ligins followed his father's example and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs in the baby.
Xinhua reported that state investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna has received honors from her fellow warriors.
Tommy Drimer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Rare enough, like herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldast" Rannels commented that "The moon was as strange as I... perhaps even more... I love and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people ahead of the 2010 federal election, opponents of Australia's return to the republic have risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, saying that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the final survey responses, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his fitness has been uncertain.
He couldn't get the right medication to beat his pain, because they're banned from the Games.
Kurtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number to date.
The discovery was verified by many people using various devices and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water to the earth, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially how the Earth formed from the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political doctrine and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast with older technology based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation and subway trains will stop at Wembley, and car parking facilities, as well as parking and travel, are not available for the playing fields.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played with the doors forced shut without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to the crossing between an endemic Darwin's cane, Geospiza forte, and the newly arrived cactus cane, Geospiza conirostris.
Florry can be worked into all kinds of shapes.
It can be pulled out and made into thin wire, which can then be shaken and torn, hammered, or rolled into sheets.
It could be extremely fine-tuned and combined with other metals, and it was so fine-tuned that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "Enlightened Manuscripts".
You can make an indicator with red clover juice.
The lacquer fluid changes color depending on the acid or alkaline level of the chemical.
The pH level is evidenced by the amount of hydrogen ions (H to pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of an electron and a proton).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had drainage toilets in almost every dwelling, connected to a rather complex sewage system.
In the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets, in Roman civilization, were sometimes part of mixed public baths for men and women.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has brought us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier mode of transportation.
She has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are larger-than-life cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
As a result, many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) eat much more small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a comfortable nose, a unique feature that every cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
Flockings consist of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, generally have closer ties to one another.
Lion packs behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that behave in a manner that is remarkably similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) and also very lethal to their prey.
Like a well-trained athlete, a tiger can climb (though not as well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in a group with lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but is more like a word with a hunger and a scream.
When they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all animals that hunt ocelots are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists think that the ocelots track and find their prey by smell, by smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily as well.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a range or river, or if they go to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously needed competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans take in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, that they exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants.
Mosasaur was the super predator of his era, so he was not afraid of anything but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with over 70 sharp, sharp teeth, along with an extra set of canines, meaning that nothing that got in its way escaped it.
We cannot be sure, but he may have had a tongue like a nail, a diet that included turtles, fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not defeat it.
Although most of their food would be familiar, the Romans had many odd or unusual items for the festival, including wild boar, palloin, ants, and a type of rodent called the ger.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, rich men enjoyed eating together at banquets, where they ate their meals lying on their laps.
The times of the ancient Romans could not have included foods brought from the Americas or Asia to Europe during later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and not even ancient Romans ever tasted seafood.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each of their gods, which they called the house of the god.
People brought food to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through festivals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar that was only accessible to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called bricks, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
Apartment was not so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Life in the Hebrew household was largely outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open stands overlooking the street.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few settlements. In Norse sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, on his travels westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time despite its discovery.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", among the people, kings, customs of the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland there were many differences.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map written on the back.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence read "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was folded into a scroll for preservation.
For this reason, the mark may have been put on merely as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by the French of the Vichy regime, who in 1940 had chosen to make peace with the Germans and cooperate with the occupiers rather than fight against them.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940 and the invasion was named "Operation Dragon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the French liberation movement had liberated the south of France and were advancing toward Germany.
Civilization is called a distinct and shared culture of a fairly large group of people living and working in cooperation, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, which means "civil", which is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", which in some form also defines the size of society.
A civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous cultural footprint and a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to become recognized as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first established a weak central government - with Congress as its sole structure - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, having no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, for the enforcement of all its laws.
Nor did he have the authority to violate laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
Articles required the approval of one-tenth of all states before they could be changed, and states took central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, were the FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians competing in both international games and Olympic activities.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the grouping of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipel".
Taiwan's history goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa", or "beautiful island".
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it gave Taiwan sovereignty to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main buildings, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format of still photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It continues to be produced today, and above all, in the same formats inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually a bit of a mess, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) thus comes out to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He determines that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was viewed with a critical eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had bound European nations together, despite differences in language and customs.
His power, felt everywhere, affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are there specifically for that purpose.
The main church bodies had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many doubt whether this principle was being applied.
Soon after the start of the war, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even unarmed ships.
With the reaction to this tactic mild, Germany hoped for a similar response to its borderless war with submarines.
The prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations during the 1920's were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a rare way of telling the different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a known dynasty.
Also, between each of the dynasties there was a period of instability with separate provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out between many nobles, who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, in which thousands died in the struggle to occupy the highest office in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were also opened up to all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This was true even of the military because instead of rank being based on rank, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Nur" (Light).
The skull itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
This cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding you.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plains or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper arch sign looks like a V and the lower arch sign looks like a wire handle or a square without the bottom beam.
"Upper" means you should go to the top and push the bow, and "lower" means you should go to the ring (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a sweeter sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more stable.
You can keep your notes, but remember that the printed arcs are there for musical purposes, so they usually need to be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were on October 6, 1789, forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of merchants.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and snoring threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd decapitated a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of American imperialism's war to occupy the Philippines was paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and the interest on the bonds was floated on the stock exchange on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the profits made from the over-exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of American imperialism.
One must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order to understand the Templars.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from technological drive or the necessity of technology to the narrow sense that human fate is guided by a basic logic that relates to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two main ideas in common: that the development of technology itself goes in a direction beyond cultural or political influence and that technology on the other hand has "impacts" on societies that are natural, unconditioned on the social side.
One might say, for example, that the automobile leads to improved roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of vehicles, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of vehicles also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new health techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, brought about by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography brimmed with people and in time customs and cultures associated with that geography arose, and, since they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its position declined during the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of slow communication channels, Western styles may lag 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the major developments of the time that came about as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use bags to fasten clothes.
Existential agriculture is agriculture that is applied to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses indigenous seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and the situation continues to be the same in many developing nations.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class and/or gender of the members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership by using distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on some tragic cases of children who, because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized with adults during their upbringing.
Some feral children are restrained by humans (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parent's disapproval of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Wild children may have been the victims of severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or left.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When educated entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child manifests behavior (within physical limits) almost identical to that of the particular caretaker animal, such as: its fear or indifference to people.
While the project-based learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding-assisted learning goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, an aid that supports people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scales can be virtual and real, so a teacher is a kind of scales, but so is the little man in the form of a letter opener in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scales are embedded in software and are intended to investigate, encourage, and explain procedures that the learner may have found difficult to handle on his own.
Children are sent to the child's home for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should, under any circumstances, grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving and nurturing, but they are growing up that way.
We consider the custody system a safe haven for these children.
Our care system is expected to provide loving caregivers, safe homes, secure health care and continuing education.
The caretaker is supposed to provide for all the needs missing from the home where they were.
The Internet interfaces elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to other dimensions regarding access to uses and pleasures.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important incentives to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences reacted to websites.
Using video recordings has led to important discoveries to explain micro-expressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting his facial expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Saks showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even thought that such abilities to explain human behavior might be present in animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the group of expressed variants.
Isolation and recombination repeatedly mix variation between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of man has a hard time meeting its amino acid needs through savannah plant sources.
Also, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources would be proteins obtained from leaves and stems, but primates like us have a hard time multiplying them unless they're cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) not only digest easily but also provide large amounts of protein that has all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent the way chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking during your normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively low-volume bell clock to bring you to your senses without you being fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your sleep watch, you might place it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person possesses is directly proportional to the level of tension in his body and soul.
With the reduction of stress, the actual vitality increases.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was further enriched by the theological thought of the "way of love" of Mahayana and more Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, through which the visual representation of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, bringing cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and be fought for real, by authorized armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses had already been broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian ridge.
However, these plans fell out of use almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after the invasion of the regions of Eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while, at the same time, interfering with the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and important examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, when the Americans were trying to move people and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet was trying to stop traffic using mostly submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in taking Britain, as it had with other European countries.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to get their milk, meat, and skins easily.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that were moved to hillsides or other pastures, often under the care of goats that were usually children or adolescents, much like the better-known shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them for greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat more difficult roads of the day.
Travers were introduced early enough to hold the tires in place, but it was gradually realized that tires would be more effective if they had a sheet of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron consumed most of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking two million years ago when Homo erectus (which means "standing man") appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not normally walk.
Adaptations to bipedal walking have been found in australopithecine fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is the same as treating symptoms, but we need to find the cause of the problem and disable it if we don't want a temporary solution.
It is abundantly clear that the world has undergone great changes because of mankind's advances in science and technology, and problems have been compounded by overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its July 4 approval by Congress, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's press.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies of what are now known as Dunlap's Butterflies were made.
The first public reading of the document was made on 8 July by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it on July 9 before his troops in New York.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to exist to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have curly and scaly legs, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and, in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open box of toxic medicines or household chemicals may be the clearest sign of intoxication.
Check the label for specific instructions for emergency treatment for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term kander in its official sense.
The term is derived from its ancient resemblance to bed bugs, which are highly adapted insects that parasitize humans.
Like the insect killer, bed bugs are herbivores, adapted to live in the nest or in the shelter of their host.
Across the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), thus remaining the most important neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of their child.
Such couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually drives most scientific research.
But it is not the only one; scientific research is also guided by experimentation, and experiment is the test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on every scientific subject, including psychological ones.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms regarding physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, occasional rhythms have been documented that are not simply a response to occasional external cues.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue a period of free-moving cycles even when no external signals are present.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they tagged the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in going to natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the plants and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, visits to parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is the development of tours, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from the cities to their workplaces and pass by other people whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic movement of transportation, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive carbon-based economy has caused the biosphere to shift from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses the transportation system.
In developed lands, rarely do we hear so many complaints about water quality or damaged bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such discontent, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic motion is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a fixed time interval; therefore, traffic flows can be mathematically calculated with approximation.
To better represent the flow of traffic, links have been made between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, design and use of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators more easily and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their arms back along the length of their body.
This gives them more small places to be scratched by predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings back are the ladybirds and the butterflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed otherwise; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the first wide, flowing eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at six miles wide in some cases.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids' construction was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors that were at that time far older than a thousand years.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language spoken daily by most of the state's workers, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since ancient times about such basic chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper, all of which can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easily extracted from mines by primitive means.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - earth, air, water, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also created the theory that they transform into new matter to create whatever we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also make alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could take out the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, with his invention, the pencil became a good companion for many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of the pencil has declined.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to use a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that the joining of some protons and neutrons to a nucleus requires energy.
It's like riding a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the core from the original, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to divide by themselves or with the slightest irritation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side of the moon.
It is thinner under dark marshy areas and thicker under mountainous areas.
There could be more seas nearby because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they keep inside as they grow older.
These theories analyze what makes some people want the things they want and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to manage their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unusual decisions, imposing disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, assigning duties and responsibilities to everyone.
On the other end of the spectrum, such a person easily becomes an unknown person, who thinks that he or she should change everything the team has done and adopt it.
After all, the leader bears ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior causes a rift between managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is the management team where each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating an education organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and skill can be shown.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a hurdle can lead to a regenerative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organizational knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical treatment of cognitive research, and as a result, they narrow the scope of research and make it much more accurate.
The interconnectedness between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has taken strong nuances in science fiction literature, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, programming planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become special disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, having been incorporated into some personal computer and video game software applications.
It is not uncommon for a teacher to express a desire to take her students to places where the bus is not available.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips, where students can visit museum artifacts, view an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Virtual field trips are also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their trip to the nation's capital, and this website is modified every year, but the old versions are still stored online as a memory block.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer initiates efforts to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture the interests of the audience inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
Using blogs in the right way "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can determine their own positions regarding posts by others, as well as determine their own views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital city with a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muscat and beyond.
All of this and more make Ontario the home of what foreigners consider to be the most typical Canadian.
The large areas farther north are sparsely populated, and some are almost deserted and uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated states of France are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers identify as married, regardless of actual marital status.
It helps if you bring a ring (not just one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural changes can cause what they consider bullying and stalking, holding hands, etc. is not uncommon.
Be firm when rejecting men and do not be afraid to hold your ground (even if it is due to cultural differences, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Imazigh fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meridith as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to do shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as taginas, ceramics, leather goods, carnations, and a whole range of ornaments, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Niragongo volcano that covered most of the city's streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is somewhat secure, you should research any visits outside Goma to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Niragongo volcano along with some of the lowest cost mountain gorilla chases in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motor taxi) to move around Gomma. The usual price (local) is approximately 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its ridiculous inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic faraway places.
Timbuktu is today a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990, due to the danger from desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates's special broadcast for the Public Broadcasting Service "Wonders of the African World".
The city has a strong contrast to the rest of the cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to a variety of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is called the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, the park has a daily fee for entry and maintenance.
You may also have the luxury of purchasing a "Wild Card", which provides entry to each of South Africa's selections of parks or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place considered the main destination by many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a vibrating striped graph that is highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon pier opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on a subsidized land along the northern shore.
This is a country that was colonized by the British, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal belt of rhizomes worldwide, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland to the Bengal and Indian coastal areas.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in the Indian part is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not merely rhizome swamps; they include some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the valley of northern India.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, approximately one third of which is covered by water/sand dune surfaces.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a haven for wildlife and it is estimated that the area now has 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 deer have been encountered.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling eastwards and to Dzhakar/Bumthang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as long-distance buses often get crowded.
Most of the prefectures are served by Japan's comfortable and powerful Coaster minibuses.
Taking a taxi together is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Ojapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Ojapok River to connect the cities of Ojapok in Brazil and Saint-George and Ojapok in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two runways that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the guaicuru and the pajagua, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was created as a result of the confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
It was the Spanish who ushered in the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches, go to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Folkland pound (FKP), whose value is set equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located at Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will be generally accepted throughout the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
In outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and U.S. currencies may be accepted.
Outside the islands, it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency, so cash your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be a cold one to lie: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than what is colder than the thermometer's temperature.
There is no particularly "rainy" or "dry" season: the rainfall is about the same year-round.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and need no feeding or disturbing.
According to the park administration, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wildlife!
As clever as they may seem, buffalo, deer, bald eagles, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep their distance, and these are wild, large, and possibly dangerous animals, and you have to give them the space they need.
Also, remember that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid handling or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval collision in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful organization in the city brought about the assassination of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because of Auckland's stretch between two ports.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north and to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukaua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Road are in Waietamata Harbour, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches sometimes overcrowded with a lot of shops lining the shore.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and delicious.
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more readily available.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a "white-only" coffee is something foreign: a short black coffee is an "express", cappuccino is served covered in cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian by Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are many trips on tires throughout the year, and tire damage from any of these causes is rare.
But again, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The kubozoa sea lights appear near beaches and river gorges from October to April, north of the bay, and occasionally they may appear outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being the river gorges north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance makes the traveler sleepy in the knowledge that there will be a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Often, travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find that other types of accommodation, such as campsites, can be booked through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp in the same location, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activity, you'll have to get there early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music may have ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic during the winter, check where your cabin is, as moving on the ice causes a very terrible noise for those who are most sensitive.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in good spirits and in their proper surroundings.
Some places give out free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will drive in large geographic areas or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is minimal and you cannot steer the vehicle as if you were on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, you can get stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or hailstones or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy weather and snow are common in many places, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the main attraction of tourism in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in common usage, refers to trips over land to view Africa's wild and amazing life, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually get close to cars, and with standard equipment, you can get a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "shrub walk", "walking safari", or "walking") consists of a walking, multi-hour or multi-day trip.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a mess.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to be priced from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with typical tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have irons and ironing tables available to rent, even if you do not have one in your room.
If you do not have an iron or do not wish to wear ironed socks, you may try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are various ways to treat water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes just one minute to boil the water; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters have different effects, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unknown in their areas.
Parasites can damage food, cause skin irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not generally qualified as harmful.
Duty-free purchases are a case of purchasing goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in some countries.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can occasionally save a considerable amount of money, especially on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The segment of road between Point Marion and Vermont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, often traversing isolated terrain of virgin forest.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind at rest: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/ h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than in other circumstances.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than on other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are as varied and diverse as those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastes are common, from those with apples that are cooked year-round to those with onions that are cooked in summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, garlic, and other dried fruits. Typical types of cake go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich sweets, try what, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfannkushen, or krapfen.
Kerri is a herb- and spice-based dish with meat or vegetables.
The wax can be "dry" or "liquid", depending on the amount of liquid.
Coconut milk is generally used in the inland provinces of North India and Pakistan; in South India and some other coastal provinces of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But the term is intended to denote foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java in case it is used without other qualities.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, has a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavorings favored by Javanese being: peanuts, spices, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and some aromatic spices.
The riders' legs are supported by the riders' legs that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but they can be a safety problem because of the possibility of riders getting their feet caught in them.
If the rider jumps off the horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, a tow may be made if the horse leaves.
First, most motorcyclists wear boots with very tight, smooth heels and soles.
Then, some shawls, especially English shawls, have safety strips that allow the saddle belt to fall off the saddle if pulled back by the falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier mountaineering destination, known as the Josemite of South America, with a variety of massive walls and granite cliffs.
Mountains include stunning views from the ridges, and climbers from every corner of the world are constantly trying out new routes between its pages with endless possibilities.
Hilltop snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many admirers, sometimes known as "ski nomads", whose sole purpose of vacation is to ski in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first ski training club.
Backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski touring.
It is related to, but does not usually include, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering tours, where the latter are developed on steep terrain and require much stronger skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as similar to a walking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than by walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the cleaned slopes.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent states, and under normal circumstances, travel to many countries would require visa applications and numerous passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in the area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in person in any Schengen country, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
This definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be lower in countries like North America compared to Europe.
Craft products can be called antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Kidney farming (northern deer) is an important livelihood for the Samites and the culture around the trade is also important for many people with other professions.
Although traditionally the Sami have not all been heavily involved in reindeer herding, they have lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, primarily using reindeer as game.
Today, many Sami people work in modern crafts, and tourism is a major source of income in the Sami area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is generally considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If a travel recommendation is issued for the country you are going to, you may be covered by travel medical insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but they are programmed for their citizens.
To give an example, American citizens may face different circumstances in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory notices are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified compared with the more detailed information given elsewhere.
"Severe weather" is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious disruption of social life, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of it that can be conditioned by geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The forms of severe weather consequences include high winds, thunderstorms, numerous fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterfalls, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather conditions include blizzards, snowstorms, sandstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather hazards that may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be called a war zone needs professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environments Course" might give you the address of a local society.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will be regular from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, plenty of training in first aid and sometimes weapons.
Desert survival books and magazines are common, but few publications cover war zones.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without the gender (X) declaration or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents also varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, security checkpoints became much more annoying.
Transgender people before surgery should not wait to pass through scanners without violating their privacy and dignity.
Shore currents are the return flow of waves that leave the shore, often in a rubber or similar form.
Submarine topology causes the return current to concentrate to some deeper parts and there a fast current can form towards the sea bottom.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and if you've been spotted, maybe it's best to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs sooner than culture shock (has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after your life abroad, you will have adjusted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs from your home country's culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect that travelers returning home will also need patience and understanding.
The light and sound display of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
Before the show begins, you can see the pyramids in silence and in the dark.
You usually hear the voices of tourists and vendors all the time.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The images appear on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and there are more bases there, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others include Livingston Island of Deception, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano offers an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Belingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains join here at the summit and then re-emerge to form a 360-mile chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which are separated by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel ranges have Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (15,050 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite telephones cannot generally replace cell phones, since you must be outdoors with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice calls.
Your local telephone provider may be able to provide additional information about how to connect to this service.
One option that is increasingly popular for those planning a sabbatical is travel and study.
This is especially preferred by high school dropouts, who can take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical year abroad can actually increase your chances of entering higher education when you return home.
In general, enrollment in these educational programs will require a tuition fee.
Finland is a great destination for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on these lakes and archipelagos.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but apart from them, it is something quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most private cruises in the Baltic have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days, while returning and spending the night on the boat.
If you go to the coast only on boat trips, you will not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, so a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of many, many other things.
For some, a little knowledge of how the plane works and what happens on a flight can help them to overcome fears based on the unknown or out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly, and time is often very important for work papers, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some airlines, the larger companies have their own planes, but it was a problem for other airlines and smaller companies.
If the items were to be shipped by air, some routes might take days to go through the unloading and disposal process.
The only way to get through faster would be to check in as checked baggage.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to save up a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have the company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a general rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business-class fare and eleven times the first-class fare!
Usually, it is not even worth asking for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there are a handful of passengers who willingly pay high fares for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably and who adjust their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
This conflict led to the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religious faith in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a fairly good transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it has now become a bustling, modern, and developed commercial center, perched on a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Among the wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are scattered traditional red-brick roofs, an 18th-century marketplace and old churches and mosques, although the atmosphere of the city resembles more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island Eisturoi and has a strange octagonal church.
Above the churchyard tombs, there are several interesting sculptures, in the shape of doves, made in marble.
It's worth a half-hour walk through the village of intrigue.
To the north and very nearby is the romantic and charming town of Sinatra, which became famous to foreigners after a brightly colored tale of its beauties, written by Lord Byron.
The 403 Scotturb bus runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also, head north to the splendid Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of world-famous apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has almost unparalleled significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived the times they spent here and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked there to their death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Show dignity, solemnity and respect to this object, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the object's appearance by making notes or graffiti on these structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only marked in Catalan, because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
The usual announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but for unplanned interruptions the announcements are made by an automated system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, harsh, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé".
The harsh appearance of the Parisians will soon soften if you show some basic good manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly with ahu trees, coniferous and oak trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, unique soils, and varying levels of elevation.
The region is also home to a vast number of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife can be found there, including the European black bear, wolf, eagle, cuckoo, raccoon, wildcat, and wild deer, along with many more common species.
When entering a convent, women are required to wear a knee-high cap and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer headscarves to women who come unprepared, but if you take yours, especially a brightly colored one, you will get a smile from the monk or nun on entering.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the spare pants at the entrance, but those clothes don't wash after every wearer, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these wide pants.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil entirely.
A typical simple dinner of the area, especially during summer, is "La amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever other ingredients are available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All the names next to the word "Sie", meaning "you", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from their opponents.
It also makes reading obviously easier, although writing is a bit complicated because of the need to detect whether a verb or a surname has been used in substantiated form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be careful of are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce the R and the R differently: "caro" means "darling", and "carro" means "chariot".
Persian has a somewhat simple and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, if you read this practical grammar book, you will be able to learn much about Persian grammar and better understand its expressions.
Needless to say, if you master a Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is very similar, so there is no need to study it on your own.
The observatories of the medieval era are now mostly disused and used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their day as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campus, where they are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large objects in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the favorite flower was the pumpkin.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look much better in their natural habitat, so do not be tempted to remove them as if they were a "lone" specimen.
If you visit a garden that is organized according to rules, even collecting "samples" will get you out without a fight.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy place to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But since it is located in the "northern tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with either the heat (always) or the strong sun (less often, when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are considering goes into Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjath-arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to provide the base for vacations around them.
For example, by visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting sites on the Danube or sailing along the Irian Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted by unbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into festivities as soon as midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or breeding.
Because of its great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals, including horses, cattle, goats, cats, dogs, and mice, have also arrived.
If you visit Antarctica or the Arctic during the winter, you will enjoy the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to watch the auroras, since the sky will be dark most of the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, visual pollution is easy and usually not a problem, so you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Costumes are standard business attire, and colleagues call each other by their last names or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievement.
Often, employees must get their superiors' approval for every decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
