The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar patterns across the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across countries, although the steps vary by country.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should increase their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare and especially ultra-efficient treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown morphology were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified a new coronavirus as a pathogen, now called acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was named as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) as it was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Evidence so far has shown that 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 takes the form of more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% of cases, the illness becomes serious requiring intensive care.
The hospitalized death rate due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the composite case patterns of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province of China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with cases in Italy from 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, there was further geographical spread of COVID-19 and the rest of the world's COVID-19 pandemic data is now following the situation in this country.
On 11th March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The March 5 issue of EuroSurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al, reported the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by WHO.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded as of 31 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Collecting the number of COVID-19 cases and collecting the incidents
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) keeps a record of COVID-19 cases from every country around the world, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 am using official sources such as the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and compare them to cases in Italy.
As a sample of the extent of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14 days of cumulative cases of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the aggregate number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 am on 15th March 2020 and compared them with the cases in Italy from 31st January to 15th March 2020.
The status of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK
The overall pattern of 14-day split cumulative cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK is similar to Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Across the EU/EEA and UK, the combined cases of COVID-19 started to rise around 21 February and then started to rise rapidly by 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This included the rapidly increasing reported cases in Italy, but also the increasing pattern of combined cases of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (Supplementary Material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to cases in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlighted that 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported as many cases as Italy, three weeks earlier or less than 8am on 15 March.
Our results show that COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed pattern of combined cases of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparatively fast pace across all countries.
Further, as different countries are at different stages, gaps in national public health responses and different country-specific definitions of potential cases and different protocols of patient selection need to be examined for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation where ICU is needed for 10% of patients with COVID-19, and media sources have indicated that hospitals and ICU in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization and/or ICU admissions of COVID-19 patients are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to compile current surveillance data in a consistent, systematic manner that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there is a large disparity in the number of ICU and Medium Medical beds in Europe, which is 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have less or more resources than Italy (in 2010-11 12.5 ICU and Medium Medical beds per 100,000 population).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases in hospitals in each EU/EEA country and UK is associated with a > 90% risk of ICU bed capacity exceeding the sample capacity saturation associated with the ICU bed capacity exceeding > 90% risk, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are still limited to a few specific regions of EU/EEA countries and UK and hospitals and ICUs are providing treatment to a specific regional population, case data and ICU data should be made available preferably within the definition of regional centres for Figure 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience of Italy and the current pattern in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and ICUs need to prepare themselves for the continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who will need health care and especially ICU treatment, as has occurred in the affected areas of Italy.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment showed, a fast, proactive and inclusive approach to mitigation is needed, rather than delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the expected rapid increase in such cases will not allow decision makers and hospitals to assess, accept and adapt their responses if not implemented early.
Public health measures have also been listed in the Rapid Risk Assessment to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries can further increase their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients who will require ICU in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, and has been a catastrophe for humanity.
Like its homologous SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of deaths in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted by bats and exhibited similar symptoms by similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmissible and is affecting older people than young people and men more than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the developing research topic.
We have covered the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review will help us understand and combat this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of 25th January 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all those Chinese who were told to stay home throughout the holidays and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new infectious disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, so on 11 February 2020, the WHO renamed it SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COV Disease 19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2nd March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7th January 2020, which has determined the sequence of the virus in addition to various patients.
This review seeks to summarize research progress in new and slowly evolving subjects.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-borne diseases, including Middle East respiratory disease (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prognosis and some remaining urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds.
However, we have faced two highly deadly human CoVs in this century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which first broke out in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and quickly spread to other countries with high morbidity and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human recent history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported by the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
The CoV order was issued seven days later.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infections were reported among healthcare providers, indicating that the virus could spread from humans to humans.
On January 23, a complete lockdown was imposed in Wuhan and all public transport was shut down.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 cases had come in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered to be an early centre of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and to 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2.2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final status and intensity of the outbreak is still uncertain.
A multi-central study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11 February 2020 has presented an updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but primarily targeted people in the 30-65 age group.
Half (47.7%) of those infected were aged 50 years, the lowest were under 20 years and only 14 were under 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.27/1,00,000) than women (0.31/1,00,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in Hubei and surrounding urban groups.
The average time from infection to diagnosis of COVID-19 is 5 (2-9) days.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from infection to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased dramatically before 23 January 2020, which coincided with the large outbreak before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with fixed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and overlapping subfamily of viruses that includes a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta CoVs are known to affect humans.
This overlapping spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then skin fusion occurs.
The infectious RNA genome is released into the cell membrane; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA forms virion-containing vesicles with overlapping glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new variant of Beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequential samples taken from the epicenter of the outbreak, Hunan Seafood Market in Huan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in the extremely thin areas of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than the S protein of SARS-CoV, which in turn causes less severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a new mini protein, encoded by orf3b, and a spliced protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and inhibit expression of IFNß; however, orf8 does not involve any known functional domain or target.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. indicated that the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution was mixed with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture structures that were open and closed were combined as dimers, and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Primary and intermediate hosts
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans from feeding cats and camels, respectively.
Genealogical comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs suggested that bats were considered local hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is not known which medium carriers helped the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans and the route of transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes must have been carriers for the passage from bats to humans, with homosexual recombination occurring during S protein.
In a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that a long-nosed, ant-eating cat widely used in traditional medicine in China could be a potential medium host for SARS-CoV-2, for which a 99% genetic similarity was found between the CoV found in the eaten cat and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% gap between the two genomes is still a large gap, so solid evidence is awaiting for a conclusive conclusion (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and in temperatures of 20°C and 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot survive in ultraviolet rays and at temperatures of 56°C after 30 minutes, with ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and other copper solvents other than chlorhexidine effectively neutralizing it.
The human race as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no extensive studies have been conducted on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, specifically: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when a virus attacks a host, it is first identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus triggers inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation and type I interference (INN), which limits viral spread and accelerates the macrophage phagocytosis of the viral antigen.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus escape the immune response.
Soon, the favorable immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells induce B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce cytokines, which provide protection to the cells.
However, COV can inhibit T cell function by involving T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes elements and antibodies like C3A and C5A, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies taken from recovered patients have killed MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces large numbers of locally free cells that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, organ damage and even death.
Group-initiated SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to occur in older adults and pregnant women with possible comorbidities.
People who have other diseases or have a weakened immune system are more likely to get infected than others.
The estimated median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most cases lasting 3-7 days, as in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, the 1,099 case studies showed that the average heating period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As described above, a very recent study showed that the incubation period in a population of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0 - 7.2) days.
It is crucial for healthcare authorities to coordinate effective isolation periods based on the most accurate incubation period, which will prevent infected but asymptomatic people from spreading the virus to others.
As a general measure, individuals who have been in contact with or infected with the virus should be quarantined for a maximum of 14 days.
Is the quarantine period 24 days necessary?
Fever is the major and early symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by absence of symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, wheezing, muscle cramps, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within a week of becoming ill.
In severe cases, patients immediately develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened for the virus early for diagnosis, even if there is a pulmonary imaging abnormality.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55% and diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients required ventilation assistance.
Similar findings have been made in two recent studies of a family group and a group of people infected by an asymptomatic person.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of them required ventilation assistance, which was much higher than COVID-19 cases and MERS was more deadly than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat itching (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been observed that fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and approximately 14-20% of patients required ventilation support.
As of February 14, when the confirmed cases had reached 66,576, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
By comparison, by November 2002, the SARS death rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2494 confirmed cases based on a demographic study in June 2012.
Previous studies had indicated that SARS-CoV-2 had a RO of as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV had a RO of between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and RO is given in Table 1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less deadly of the two.
Thus, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The group initiation often starts in the same family or with a single ceremony or a single vessel such as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected individuals or within the last two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been suggested that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients who have been discharged from hospital may carry the virus again, which has led to the caution to extend the period of isolation.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreasing numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L including < 1×109/L lymphocyte count and elevated aminotransferase levels and viremia.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin had increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocytosis layers had increased in the blood of most patients.
In the severe cases, the blood levels of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product, were elevated and the lymphocyte count decreased rapidly.
Most COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in chest radiography and were characterized by bilateral patch shadows in the lungs or ground glass opacity.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive darkening affects air exchange with intensity.
Type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes are damaged, which reduces the surface layer and increases surface tension, reducing the ability of the lungs to circulate and increasing the risk of lung damage.
So, the worst radiographic findings are often the same as the most serious disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19 showed that desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of an antibacterial membrane and penetration of central lymphocytes and multi-nucleated synesial cells in the lungs of patients who died of disease was consistent with viral infection and ARDS and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate that accelerated the epidemic, medical manifestations (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) began to be used for diagnosis in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation began to emerge with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings are important and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibres at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) within one hour without the need for extensive tools using a dipstick.
The hope is that if validated in clinical samples, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, practitioners can only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients and try out various treatments that have been previously used or proposed on other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential therapies including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered plasma, Chinese medicine and psychosocial support.
Not only that, but it was proposed to use cells from recovered patients for therapeutic purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly developing antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and possibly other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Thus, respiratory failure and malfunction is a major risk to patients and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including routine oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an enhanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance, prevention of secondary infection and septic shock, and treatment, and protection of key organ function are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been found that in SARS and MERS patients, an excess response of the immune system results in a cytokine storm.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is manifested by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
Cytokines induce immune system cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which is a major cause of ARDS and various organ dysfunctions.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies corticosteroids and tosilizumab are used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune response, inhibition of IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK, blintumomab, suppressor of cytokine signaling 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can lead to serious side effects, especially: avascular osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect the diagnosis.
However, short-term treatment of low to moderate dose corticosteroids is recommended for the prudent use of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of this writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, in a US case of COVID-19, remdesivir was administered intravenously and was shown to be effective.
Remdesivir, a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead to treat diseases originally caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential blocking for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on this, JILID supplied the components to China for testing on patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the results were very promising.
In addition, baricitnb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may lead to diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
The first step is to create plasma and antibodies from recovered patients.
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat patients with the same disease or to prevent the spread of disease to healthy people.
It is true that cured patients have a higher number of antibodies in their blood than the pathogens.
The antibodies to fight off pathogens and other foreign substances are immunoglobulins (IGs) produced by B lymphocytes, which identify specific molecules in the pathogens and directly destroy them.
On this basis, cells were collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and 10 critically ill patients were injected.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, along with decreased inflammation and viral pressure and improved oxygen circulation in the blood.
However, until specific treatments are developed, validation and clarification for large-scale use is required.
Also, some of the losses associated with cells must be carefully considered for therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and lead to cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially lethal in its form.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells to treat a seriously ill patient is high.
It is difficult to rapidly develop and produce specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic.
It is therefore important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or test effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies rapidly.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, its effectiveness is largely dependent on the combination of various components in the formula according to the theory of TCM diagnosis of the disease.
Most effective components are unknown or uncertain because such components or their highest combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Due to the current lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has emerged as an alternative treatment option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Du capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
Various provinces of China that used TCM for treatment of COVID-19 with 87% of patients showed the highest recovery rate, namely Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province where TCM was used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a somewhat rough comparison as other influencing factors such as number of cases and severity should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the time taken to regain body temperature, relieve symptoms and be admitted to hospital was much shorter in the WM+ TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most importantly, the rate of symptomatic increase (mild to severe) was much lower in the WM+TCM than in the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was also much lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, for the effectiveness and safety of TCM, large scale controlled testing needs to be done in more centres.
It would be somewhat bizarre to characterize the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatments or, if possible, their combination.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 often experience severe contagious or fatal illness, and people in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Also, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as treatment side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, emotional disturbances such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mood swings, paranoid symptoms, delusions and suicidal thoughts were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and isolation as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak may make people more anxious about infection, isolation and guilt among family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and those in contact with them as well as to the general public in need.
Mental support includes the establishment of multidimensional mental health groups, regular and transparent dialogue on accurate news and treatment plans on SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, use of professional power tools and use of social distancing apps.
An effective vaccine is needed to break the chain of transmission from animal stocks of the virus and susceptible hosts to infected humans and can often be used effectively for antiviral treatment to control epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop an S protein-based vaccine to generate long-term and efficacious antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, physical performance and lethal challenge patterns in adult subjects and protective factors against animal-transmitted viral infections have not been detected in the vaccine candidates prior to the start of clinical studies.
This may be because the impact of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, the outbreak cases and some mass incidents of MERS have occurred in the Far East and continue to spread to other regions, suggesting that animal-transmitted sources exist in the region.
A vaccination strategy for MERS was developed using inert viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microorganisms, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some animal samples were evaluated.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the obstacle is challenging as it requires a long time (average 18 months) to develop a vaccine and dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is now showing its full therapeutic sequence in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without any recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for healthcare institutions to establish diagnostic models to prioritise their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
As described above, in the study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients with COVID-19 aged over 50 years were aged between 30-65.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying disorders and complications and were significantly older than those without (51 versus median age of 66), suggesting age as a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are likely to develop serious heart problems and arrhythmias.
Heart disease was also one of the leading causes of death among SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to bind to ACE-2 positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that the relationship between age and current illness is important and can influence each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are a potential long-term diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and ultimate recovery.
Correlation of CRP levels with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and are released in tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional predictor of heart or liver failure.
Key Medical Symptoms: Chest radiography and transient increase in medical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues in making conclusions and estimating the complexity of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used as adjunctive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
The widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in severe SARS patients has led to many survivors suffering from osteoporosis, including lifelong disability and reduced life expectancy.
Therefore, if necessary, low-dose and short-term use of steroids should be recommended in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients suffered from additional stress during the COVID-19 outbreak as they had to live in isolation and very precarious conditions for long periods of time and witnessed the deaths of family members and loved ones.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are different from those of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 recurrence can occur more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract than the lower respiratory tract and may be mild or no symptoms at the initial stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause colds.
Thus, infected patients in early stages or retention period can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities, which can make it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection is thought to spread when patients are seriously ill, whereas most infections do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the SARS outbreak and is difficult to control.
China is currently undertaking large-scale efforts, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of nearly the entire population, to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing and the pandemic appears to be slowing down.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, has predicted that COVID-19 which is more infectious than SARS will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian team has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the mid-turbine and throat swab of a patient who was discharged from hospital 2 weeks after recovering from illness, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be in a flu-like cyclical sequence.
However, there are encouraging signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which is showing a positive impact of the current policies.
Initial estimates of the number of cases and deaths were as high as 1 million.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control due to strict quarantine.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 will, like SARS-CoV, weaken to ineffective and eventually become extinct or a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS pandemics is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus has also been detected in feces, which has raised the possibility of infection from feces to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases may have been hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect people, especially: healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and not only that, but also the people who are in close contact with the sick or infected.
The first safety step to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series #1860s) help to prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected individuals from reaching the surface of the material through the air, so that they do not infect others.
However, only the N95 (series #1860) mask can stop the respiration of microviruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
As it can penetrate through five surgical masks with particles one on one, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series #1860) without surgical masks.
Along with masks, healthcare providers must also wear fitted isolation gowns to avoid contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect people through the eyes.
On 20 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should use transparent face masks or goggles when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered the ideal distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures have been identified as effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was a new virus to the human world, it was reported on January 7, 2020 as a homologue of SARS-CoV, which should have sounded the alarm in China with the memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, even on 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan Disease Control Center was telling people that the new virus is less infectious and less capable of human-to-human replication, and that it is not difficult to contain and control the disease.
This message greatly reduced the sense of caution among the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time in Wuhan to keep the disease at a minimum was missed.
China's disease control authorities can learn from this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take the following precautions: (1) be more careful in making public announcements as every word spoken to the public is important and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information in clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or nurses; (3) impose more restrictions to prevent potential epidemics at an early stage rather than reassure the public; and (4) issue timely and effective drills to increase public awareness of the epidemic and test and improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new virus, SARS-CoV-2, which started in late December 2019.
Within two months of writing this, it had spread throughout China and to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak created a sense of SARS returning.
However, there is a significant gap between COVID-19 and SARS, which is crucial for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men more than young men and older men more than women, and has higher rates of severity and mortality among older men than young men.
The SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus without symptoms, while SARS patients only do so when they are seriously ill, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading more rapidly and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who recovered from the virus can become positive again.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of the virus spreading.
This rapid progress in COVID-19 research has left many important issues unresolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like COVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
Which animal was the medium species for transmitting the virus from the original host, the bat or the human?
Without knowing the answers to # 1 and # 2, we cannot effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can never return.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the airway cells and subsequently make diagnostic changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE-2 expression cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during infection in humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, like SARS, or will it continue to come like the flu?
The answers to these and many other questions are still to be found, but it may take some time.
However, whatever happens, we have no choice but to get the disease under control as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The origin of the animal disease of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their progenitors with humans has been driven by mutation and adaptation.
Before 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoVs) were known to cause mild cold-like illnesses.
The outbreaks of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The coronavirus resurfaced with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019, and we were surprised by its high transmissibility, but its pathogenicity was lower than that of its cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal disease and therefore it is in our interest to understand the origin of the animal disease of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are nonpathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to be mediated by parasitic fungi.
Identifying animal toxins can have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of animal-to-animal interactions of the COVID virus may shed light on important information on the human COVID pathogen.
In this review, we are presenting a review of the existing information on seven HCoVs, with a focus on their discovery history as well as their animal origin and inter-membrane transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCOVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful replacement of the pathogen and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of unspliced, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The largest of these RNA viruses, with a genome of 26 to 32 kilobases, are called "COVs" because they look like a crown under an electron microscope.
Structurally, COVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, which are designated as NSP1 to 16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
Numerous gene-specific helper proteins are also encoded by different lineages of COV.
According to the different protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation contains the highest number of HCoVs and is divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice serve as the genetic source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary hosts for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, COVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
At present, seven human CoVs (ACOVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, which are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly associated with mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively high number of patients who are at increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of common cold patients.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 that produce self-limiting symptoms.
However, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely believed that HCoV infections were generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people with an estimated 10% of the raw case fatalities.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuous epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread rapidly to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the vector of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had caused more than 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven animal diseases of ACOV are originating in bats, mice or pets.
Various evidence supports the theory of bat origin, in which viruses have taken over and are not pathogenic but show remarkable genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the origins of the animal disease of ACOV reveals the natural history, driving forces and constraints behind the species leap.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of the host, mediator and promoter parasite (V) Poshinda of SARS-CoV-2, thus playing an important role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide an overview of the animal origin of the disease, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoV.
In particular, we emphasize the following general themes and discuss that the HCoV parent virus is not normally pathogenic in its natural parasitic host but becomes pathogenic when it is interspecies in a new host.
We also looked at the art of HCoV evolution in which if infectivity increases, pathogenicity decreases.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal COV has been known since the late 1930s.
Before first isolating HCoV-229E strain B814 from nasal secretions of a cold patient, different COVs were isolated from various infected animals including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCOVs have been identified in the last decade.
A brief summary of the findings of HCoVs in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and subsequently produced WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have experienced cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, tingling and itching of the throat, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from a small mouse organ culture and then a serial passage in the brain.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, which is not distinguishable in terms of symptoms from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally prevalent and transmit primarily during the winter season in low temperature environments.
In general, the recovery time of these two viruses is less than a week and then about two weeks of illness.
Studies on human volunteers have shown that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have developed mild colds.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also called "atypical pneumonia", was the first properly documented nationally spread HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 774 deaths and 8,096 reported cases, spread across several countries and continents.
Without hyper-transmitters, it is estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with a recovery period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral exposure on day 10 of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may experience initial muscle aches, headaches, fever, tingling and chills followed by shortness of breath, cough and later shortness of breath.
Neuroblastoma, impaired liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities found in SARS labs.
Diffuse alveolar damage, growth of diaphragm cells and an increase in macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive ventilation and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected with this serious disease, often a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been countless efforts for HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially found to be more prevalent in children, the elderly, and patients with immunocompromised respiratory disease.
The common symptoms of illness caused by HCoV-NL63 are colds, eye infections, fever and respiratory infections.
Another separate study described the same virus in the nasal secretions of an eight-month-old baby with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and its highest incidence occurs during summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with inhibition colitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma progression, including community-acquired pneumonia and respiratory infections.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have been systematically accepted in humans and are less likely to evolve into highly pathogenic diseases, although for unknown reasons they may also cause accidents, as in the case of the more virulent subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China as recently as the year 2000.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and persist in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Although most of the confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases of occasionally imported secondary transmission due to close contact were reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak came in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS suffered severe renal failure, which is very unusual for MERS among HCoVs.
The number of patients with digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting was over 30%.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases had been reported with a fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to mankind.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases associated with the well-known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of lower respiratory infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and renamed the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the case fatality rate in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, compared to 1.2%, abroad.
SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, cough and pneumonia.
Some patients also developed hypoglycemia.
Pneumonia was one of the most serious symptoms and could rapidly escalate into severe respiratory distress.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology, they are in different branches in phylogenetic structure.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been reported asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 and they may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals a large number of similarities and differences.
First, the duration of the incubation period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and HCoVs from four communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is showing features that are common during HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even though the rate is low, SARS-CoV infections also show a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection characterizes the curious patterns of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs transmitted through the community.
On the other hand, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases decrease the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 when spread to humans, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies will see whether the seizure-to-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays the same role as SARS-CoV in at least some cases.
It will be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonality, as it does in community-acquired HCoV cases.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its characteristics of infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained human transmission after human transmission will be influential in the eventual fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs from all four mild symptomatic communities have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both could have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
The elimination of HCoVs and other serious human-caused diseases.
To do this, HCoVs must be allowed to replicate in humans to a degree sufficient to accumulate favorable mutations that would defeat the pathogen's inhibitors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to become fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its spread from humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
For years, four community-acquired COVID-19 viruses have been spreading to humans, causing colds in immunocompromised individuals.
These viruses do not need animal shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs have not adapted well to humans and their transmission from humans will not be sustainable.
They should be maintained and propagated in their animal habitat and spread to susceptible human targets, preferably through one or more intermediate and amplifier hosts.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least for now, it is highly contagious, like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoVs or MERS-CoVs.
It remains to be seen whether they will be able to adapt to humans without shelter or intermediate animals, and spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it would be appropriate for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, habitat, mediator and promoter of HCoV, Poshinda.
An animal can become a host for HCoV evolution if it has hosted a closely related ancestor that shares high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
In these strains, the ancestral virus is often adapted and not pathogenic.
Similarly, parasitic scavengers provide HCoV with a permanent and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the parasite is naturally infected and is a natural carrier of HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is introduced to a mediating host just before or during its introduction to humans, it does not adapt to the new pathogen and is likely to become pathogenic.
These intermediate pathogens can then act as animal pathogens of human transmission and act as propagator pathogens, providing the virus with a chance to temporarily replicate and then transmit to humans to increase the extent of human transmission.
An HCoV infection can be terminated if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can accept mediated nutrients and not only do so, but can establish long-term pathogenicity.
In this case, the intermediate parasite becomes the natural parasite parasite.
Epidemiological data have predictably revealed that the first SARS case has a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IGG was higher in animal trade than in the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvae) and raccoon dogs were first identified in live animal markets as carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses, which were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reinforced by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all the civets in the market.
However, it was also reported that masked palm civets from wild or farmed areas not in contact with live animals were mostly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be mediating enhancer hosts but not natural harbours of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so it is not ruled out that different species of small mammals could also act as mediators for SARS-CoV.
These are all seen as the final vestiges of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research into natural animal host SARS-CoV identified a closely related bat COVID, called SARS-related Rhinolopus bat COVID HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the groundwork for the new idea that bats feed on evolving human pathogens.
Several SARS-like COVID (SL-CoV) were identified from bats, but none other than WIV1 were identified as live viruses.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from bat semen samples which were demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, the blood of a recovered SARS patient was able to neutralize WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is high similarity between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that WIV1 is not a mediating parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV.
Genealogical analysis groups MERS-CoVs into the same cluster as does COVID-HKU4 and BAT COVID-HKU5.
The bat cov-hKU4 and MERS-CoV poshinda grahi, use dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the entry of the virus.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymers of MERS-CoVs is close to those found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild bats.
Only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology was found between MERS-CoV and its closely related bat-CoV-HKU25.
Thus, it is possible that bats are not the immediate parasitic hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV specific immunoglobulin antibodies, such as Middle Eastern-bred camels found in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from the nasal swab of the dromedary camel, further suggesting that the camels act as parasitic nutrients for MERS-CoVs.
It is noteworthy that a large number of viruses, which are generally mild in nature, have been experimentally detected in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Significantly, infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the urinary tract, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus from the throat.
However, the question remains that many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before showing symptoms, human-to-human transmission routes or unknown transmission routes in which unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV are likely to be the cause.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat COVID RATG13 isolated from rhinolophus related bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG-13 is very good for determining paternity.
This means that bats are unlikely to be immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar bat-CoV is detected in the future.
The most likely SARS-CoV-2 vector is a poaching animal of a wildlife species sold and killed at the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which several of the early cases of COVID-19 are associated, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Numerous recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica - the feeding cat) may also be the habitat for SARS-CoV-2-associated ancestral beta-CVO.
These new pangolins share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2 in the COV genomes.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 at the level of the nucleotide sequence with approximately 90% homology.
They group SARS-CoV-2-like viruses into two sub-branches in the genealogical tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor-binding domain (RBD), a 97.4% amino acid sequence identifier, with SARS-CoV-2.
In a paradoxical truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more distinct, yet have a higher rate of genome-wide homology sequences.
Recent research on diseased pangolins has also reported detection of viral coating on lung samples, which was found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This research adopted a separate assembly method and physical curation to generate a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full length virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that one of the animal pathogens mediating SARS-CoV-2 is pangolins.
However, due to the different sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as a direct pangolins.
Further, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much smaller than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
While the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins have the highest degree of sequence homology, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the most genome-wide sequence homology.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high degree of similarity between the RBD of pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and selectively drug-eluting coevolution-carried SARS-CoV-2.
An alternative proposal is in the benefit of recombination between pangolins SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RATG13 in a tertiary wildlife species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still looking into the immediate animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Even with high levels of pathogenic HCoV, animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Genealogical evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both originated from bat-borne COVs, while HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 has been found to have a parent virus in rodents.
It has been reported that the bat COVID-2 (Appalachian Ridge COVID-2) detected in the North American Triton bat has shown close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is chromosomally related to another bat-CoV, named Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, at the same time camels were suspected as its mediator.
For clarity, Figure 1 and Table 2 provide a summary of current knowledge on animal origin of known HCoVs.
Historically, evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs has been presented through genealogical analysis.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species from domestic cattle to infect humans in the 1890s, an epidemic of respiratory infections was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is poorly understood.
Bat alpha-CoV has been identified as closely related to HCoV-229E.
One of them is Alpaca alpha-CoV.
There are multiple layers of evidence supporting direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it is likely that humans, not alpacas, have come into contact with bats in a shared environment.
Instead, humans are more closely interacting with the minority.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are distinct and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while Alpacas alpha-CoV has been implicated in respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, Alpacas alpha-CoV has not been found in the wild.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas may have acquired HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens including rabies virus, Ebola virus, nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, while alpacas and dromedary camels can act as intermediate hosts that can transmit the virus to humans, as happened in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is evident that bats provide a rich stock of viral species for the interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
The ideal conditions of longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats ideal as 'virus carriers'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been penetrating the dromedary camel for decades.
These camels have adapted well to them which has turned them from intermediate feeder to stable and natural parasitic feeder.
MERS-CoV is a very mild disease causing and relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The infection of a small number of humans is an accident, and humans are the terminal recipients of MERS-CoV because their infection is not permanent.
The camel's role in MERS-CoV transmission is in contrast to the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, pangolins beta-CoV is highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They may be a phase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, as in the SARS-CoV cases.
Future research should consider or rule out the numerous possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
First, bats may be parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share this environment with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the mediating enlargers that have been recently identified for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Human contact with viruses is through slaughterhouses and eating fish that have been hunted.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to conduct surveys of livestock and wildlife for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in a third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different animal species, three key aspects are also important in the case of the COVID virus in facilitating the crossing of the second species barrier.
First, they have a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COVs is dependent on the stage of acceptance of the new strain of COVs, with an average replacement rate of "mild" to "high" with 10-4 replacements per year per 2 sites.
COVs have evidence-representing exoribonucleases, the deletion of which results in high levels of mutation transgression and degradation or even viability.
Surprisingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to replicate COVs by alleviating the inhibition of these exoribonucleases and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of COVs is about a million times higher than that of their progenitors.
In addition, when COVID is not well tolerated by the host, the mutation rate is always high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a distinctly low mutation rate, indicating a high level of acceptance in humans.
It may have already been adopted by another species close to humans.
As an addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well accepted by dromedary camels.
In theory, it is impossible that genetic drift will make the ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly vaccinated and conditionally anti-viral.
Second, the large RNA genomes in COVIDs allow for an additional degree of flexibility in genome editing for mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which, when conditions are right, is beneficial for the emergence of novel COVIDs.
This is supported by many other open readable frames and protein activities encoded at the 3' end of the genome.
Third, COVs switch templates between RNA replicates randomly and frequently through a "copy-selection" mechanism.
In the pancreas, they act as mixing vessels, with string switching occurring frequently during transcription of the COV RNA.
High levels of homologous full length and subgenomic RNA can be recombined to produce new COVID.
Genealogical evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal COVs such as Bat-Lov-CoV and Bat-Lov-HKU9.
The interaction between viruses and parasites in relation to infection
In addition to the three viral aspects mentioned above, viral interaction with the host is another important factor that is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a case study, which has also shown evidence of positive selection between incidents of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis of human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV appears to have been rapidly adapted to different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of S protein.
In general, in RBD in S proteins, COV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selectively targeted by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are located at the 318th to 510th amino acid S1 region, which binds to human ACE2 as well as their receptors for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows for the interspecies transmission of viruses that are able to identify ACE2 receptors from various animals, including bats, zebras, rats and raccoon dogs.
In fact, RBDs from human and civet virus isolates were found to have only six amino acid residues separated, and four of them are located in the receptor-binding pattern for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoVs have K489N and S487T mutants in their RBD, which can enhance the willingness of spike proteins to interact with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be crucial in virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in the S1 unit of S protein suggests that their binding affinity for human ACE2 may have been altered.
Of course, a cryo-EM study showed that the desire for these hostages is 10 to 20 times greater than the hostage between human ACE2 and SARS-CoVS proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-contractors are needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 also likely binds to ACE2, but with a different S-particle.
There are numerous other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful introduction of this COVID in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal nutrients.
As a cellular receptor, the effect of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and inhibitory factors.
The circulation of this nutrient protein between humans and the natural accumulation of HCoVs in animals such as bats, dromedary camels and rats can impede interspecies transmission.
Successful transmissions of HCoVs between species require strengthening of nutrient dependent factors and reversal of nutrient inhibitory factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important virus-nutrient interaction area have yet to be identified and characterized.
Using the latest CRISPR technology for SARS-CoV-2, genome-wide and non-biased screening of nutrient-dependent and inhibitory factors may be useful.
New HCoVs: going back to zero
The variation of bat COVID provides ample opportunity for emergence of new HCoVs.
Thus, bat-CoVs serve as the gene pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombination also lead to HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or destruction of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter the visual appearance of the virus.
Among SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human acceptance, as SARS-CoV-related bat virus is isolated but found to encode the defective ORF8 proteins.
The strain isolated at the onset of the human coronavirus outbreak has been shown to be characterized by the 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoV.
When removed, ORF8 splits into ORF8a and ORAP8b and is considered a positive mutation, which promotes nutrient migration.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a history of potential recombination with the lineage of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, which are characterized by a large number of small recombinant regions in RNA.
Reassembly sites were also identified in NSP 9, mostly in NSP10, and in parts of NSP 14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the disease MERS-CoV has experienced incidents of recombination in different lineages, which has been detected in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal COVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection may also contribute to unintended alteration of the viral genome, often leading to a release of the virus from the selective pressure exerted by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, which causes two-nucleotide deletion.
A single ORF4 may be found in HCOC-229E-associated bat and camel viruses, Alpaca alpha-CoV indicates single nucleotide inclusion, resulting in frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by selective pressure within their parasitic hosts.
The immediate or only mild symptoms were observed when bats were infected with COV, indicating mutual acceptance between COV and bats.
It appears that bats have adapted to COVID physically and anatomically well.
For example, defects in the activation of the pre-inflammatory response in the pancreas reduce the effectiveness of the disruptive therapy activated by COV.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cells in the larynx is suppressed by the upregulation of the suppressive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the major tissue-binding complex class I molecule.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the bat's high-metabolic activity both suppress the COV replication activity and result in proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus when a new nutrient is introduced, the genome of the virus provides the selective pressure to become highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic COV lineages also evolve in recombination, which is the precursor to the acquisition of new proteins or protein traits to absorb nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not emerged by accident in the last two decades.
COVs are known to cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic hosts such as bats or camels.
These stronger proteins replicate without killing the immune response.
Here is the secret of why the vectors suddenly appeared and what is causing the serious problem in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the high activation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, whereas where the immune response is stronger, more severe forms of lung damage appear.
In contrast, in the host, the immune response is projected from replicating the COVID.
This may be a beneficial strategy for breaking down the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interferon response is particularly strong in the pancreas.
Thus, administration of type-I interferons should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Furthermore, activation of the NLRP3 inhibitor in bats is defective.
For this reason, co-sandman of NLRP3 provider MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common pattern, which leads to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
In contrast, bat beta-CoVs shared 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoVs, whereas bat-CoVs shared 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, as the market was able to identify parasites of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals, immediate mediators for SARS-CoV-2 were not identified.
The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins beta-CoV has been found to be surprising, suggesting that pangolins may be acting as one of the mediating agents, or that pangolins beta-CoV may have contributed to the gene fragmentation in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The question remains, however, that there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either deliberately or accidentally man-made.
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has brought the covid-19 virus back into the limelight.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of the importance of our animal origin and the parasitic ancestor of HCoV in human infection.
Evidence of outbreaks showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of bat origin and that transmission to humans was mediated by pathogens.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV was caused by contact between humans and wild cats in the market, closure of the seafood market and killing of wild cats there, effectively ending the SARS-CoV epidemic.
For the same reason, given the finding that the multiple lineage of pangolins beta-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal transmission.
However, future research remains to clarify whether and how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
The camel is an important means of transportation and also a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
As was done in the wildlife market of China to contain the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach to developing an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels should be taken with the integration of other infection control measures.
Because we cannot eradicate these viruses, new mutant variants may emerge to cause outbreaks.
In the wild, there are also various species of animals called coenogenes.
In particular, the bat-CoVs are very diverse along with the animal-derived potential.
There are numerous possibilities for evolution and recombination of these animal-derived COVs, resulting in the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or life-threatening forms of COV in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some parts of China.
In the wake of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good preparedness and response plan should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They live in their own natural habitat until they get a chance to spread.
Although bats have many viral transmission features, training people to stay away from bats and other wildlife species can reduce their contact with humans.
Regular monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the life cycle of COVs and their natural hosts, which could be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and preventing future outbreaks.
To conclude, keeping humans away from the natural habitat of animal viruses is the most effective way to contain animal viruses.
Many pieces of the puzzle of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins share the same ecological space.
Second, if bats have played a more direct role in human transmission, we need to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if third mammals really functioned as intermediate hosts, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be monitored and experimentally infected with the possibility of being susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, in the future, they may be able to identify a very similar SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral virus in their natural habitat.
Continued research in this area will clarify important implications of the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.
On 6th February 2020, our team published the Rapid Consultation Guidelines for Nuclear Therapy for the diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and these guidelines have made our nation and the world a good reference for the fight against the pandemic.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience, so the diagnosis and treatment strategy is also constantly updated.
In this letter, a commentary on our guidelines is highlighted and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" as per the latest diagnosis and treatment provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, officially named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was renamed as Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed rapid consultation guidelines and published them online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted a lot of attention.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; so, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, a total of seven editions of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 were published with some reference changes.
Now our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al., who have presented simple score propositions based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidelines and has also provided a valuable reference for this global epidemic.
We applaud and thank him for his remarkable work.
However, its work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (trial version 7) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3rd March 2020), confirming a suspected case requires either one item of clinical discovery characteristic combined with two items of clinical discovery, or three items of clinical discovery if no clear clinical history is present.
Chronic history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and its surroundings, or in an area where COVID-19 cases have been reported for 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected cases (including positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with a patient with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and its surroundings, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed cases (such as in areas such as home, office, school, classroom, etc., with fever/small respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks ≥ 2 weeks).
Clinical findings: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with a typical characteristic of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a reduced total white cell count to normal, or a reduced number of lymphocytes in the early early stage.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with any one of the following components of pathogenic or serological evidence as further provided: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a complete genome sequence of viruses that increase high affinity to known novel coronavirus; (3) a positive serum test for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies; or a change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or ≥4 times in the acute phase recovery phase.
We can see that real time PCR testing for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and later in the seventh edition, serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers, including the inclusion of a blood sample from respiratory tract samples, to search for optimal nucleic acid identification for this rapid diagnosis, which has increased the availability of different samples, and supported positive results of specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there was increasing evidence that reminded us to be cautious with typical symptoms and allergic patients.
So, Zhou et al. should update their flowchart, because they're classifying a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in further clinical practice and study.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to the readers to comment on.
For diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases, we should follow and follow the latest guidelines of his home country.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in one day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the number of infected cases reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh is 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who are staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director, Dr Mirzade Sabrina Flora, said that the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzade, two cases were in the age group of 60 years, two were in the age group of 51 to 60 years, and one was in the age group of 41-50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Hospital officials told a local news outlet, Adolu Agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait Friendship Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quadar said that public transport will remain closed for longer than originally planned, until this coming Saturday.
The public transport shutdown was initially scheduled to begin on 26th March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4th April.
The transport of vital goods -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- is still allowed.
The first reported case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, including two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide
The total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide has crossed the one million mark on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea, on Thursday, claimed that it is one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the WHO had confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10.00 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, with 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that coronavirus infection killed more than 1,000 people in the U.S. on Wednesday.
Around the world, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive their salaries even without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament extended the state of national emergency for 15 days, with the resolution passed by 215 votes to 10, with one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: previously, the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has extended his stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have lowered the limit of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on purchases of toilet paper to two, respectively, and one package per transaction nationwide.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits are posted as messages on the checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, buyers are stockpiling it again and again for fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
The changes come after the previous four-pack per transaction ban introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 reveal, reported that the four-pack restriction would be, "many stores are selling out within an hour of delivery", and said that demand is "incredible", while ALDI, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a "huge increase" in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequencies. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made early availability for the planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that the retailer tried to increase inventory, but was hampered by the local council's restriction on truck-delivery time.
They expect an increase in production costs, as suppliers have to meet demand, and with less specials.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to early shipment of stock, some stores cannot run Wednesday specials.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said stores are filling up every night.
They commented that toilet paper is a large item, which leads to a low stock in quantity, and, when sold, empties a large amount of shelf space.
Coles and Woolworths showed that if there are a lot of items on the shelf, like toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there are a lot of them, you're less likely to panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said it was running out of stock.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to keep the supply streamlined.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at its auction, when some were auctioned off as buyers had time during the big Labor Day Weekend.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, the daily print in Darwin, eight water insert was added to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, the stores were originally opposed to the imposition of restrictions, stating that they had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said there is also a huge demand for other products including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the term "global pandemic" refers to more than just how dangerous a specific event is, WHO notes that there is a need for more concrete action by governments.
All countries can still change the face of this global pandemic.
If nations recognize this in response, they will test, treat, isolate, track and unite their people in this fight, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are deeply concerned about both the dangerous level of spread and the seriousness and the appalling level of inaction.
Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the global outbreak "unprecedented".
"No other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from its onset to its global spread", he said in comments published on CNN in February.
Gebreyesus expressed the same view, saying, "We have never seen the global shock caused by the coronavirus before".
He added, "And we haven't seen a global crisis that can be controlled in the same time frame".
The current global pandemic situation follows the decision by WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fosse, head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "It is certain that the situation will get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 Coronavirus outbreak is the global outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory distress virus (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak, which was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has been recognised as a global outbreak since 11 March 2020.
As of 10th April 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have recovered.
China has an estimated mortality rate of 4%, while the global mortality rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and nausea.
In complicated cases, symptoms may include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The time from infection to symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and basic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the face when coughing, keeping distance from others, monitoring, and self-isolation of those who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazards control and closing down facilities.
The global pandemic has caused severe socio-economic dislocation globally, with sporting, religious, political and cultural events postponed or cancelled, and widespread supply shortages, which have been exacerbated by fearful procurement.
Schools and universities are closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been cases of fear or hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other Eastern and Southeastern ethnicities, and people in areas that look like them and have significant cases of the virus.
The reduction in travel and the closure of heavy industries have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to Hunan's seafood wholesale market and thus the virus is believed to have originated in animals.
The virus that has caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the spider coronaviruses, the feeding cat associated coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The earliest known individual with symptoms was later found to be ill on 1 December 2019 and the individual was not directly related to the later meat market group.
In the early group of cases reported in 2019, two-thirds of the cases were found to be related to market.
An unverified report in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 suggested that a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, tracked as of 17 November 2019, may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new cases reported in China declined but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number in China for the first time.
Cases may have been reported at a much lower rate, especially in cases with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with cases aged 19 or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Valens, Chief Medical Adviser for the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before achieving mass immunity.
The cases refer to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and confirmed positive according to official guidelines.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms.
A study released on March 16 showed that as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were undetected and 79% of cases were transmitted by undocumented persons.
A statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases reported.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was initially estimated at 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of people who get COVID-19 recover.
And for those who don't, the time from onset to death is between 6 and 41 days, and for most people, it's 14 days.
As of 10th April 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, 80% of the deaths as of February 5 were people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing health problems including heart disease and diabetes. Official figures for deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include those whose official routine COVID tests have been positive.
The actual deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who die without testing, for example, at home, in sanitariums, etc.
A bit of data from Italy shows that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of deaths associated with the outbreak] is an underestimated estimate", a statement that is confirmed by incomplete reports of decreases in the US. Such decreases are frequent in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China was reported in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths had been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and time and are influenced by the number of tests performed, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to cases is the total number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio as of 10th April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies by region.
The ratio of deaths to cases in China decreased from 17.3% (1-10 January 2020 for those with symptoms) to 0.7% (1 February 2020 for those with symptoms). Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and they track a specific population from infection to resolution.
Many academic institutions have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford has estimated that the global pandemic has a mortality rate of between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate in this range is consistent with the first randomized testing of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzed the effect of testing on CFR.
WHO is confident that this global crisis can be brought under control.
The maximum level and maximum duration of this outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
Maciej Bonnie of Penn State University notes that "without screening, the outbreak stops growing at a certain level and decreases as the host population becomes less available".
But it's just impossible to make a good prediction about when that will happen".
Zhong Nan Shan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that if all countries start to follow WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, "it will be over by June".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV2 is likely to spread for one to two years.
The study, led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, found that physical distancing and other measures "will be needed (likely 18 months or longer) until a vaccine is available".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University notes that "it is impossible to eradicate the virus completely because it is so easily transmitted", so "it will be a seasonal disease and will likely return every year".
The toxicity or severity of recurrence depends on the collective immunity and the extent of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific and may not be present in infected people.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, cough, loss of smell, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or blue skin from oxygen deprivation. WHO notes that about one in six people develop serious illness and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms; for example, difficulty breathing, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial or lip blue; and advises immediate medical attention if symptoms do occur.
Some of those infected may not show symptoms, no medical symptoms but test results may confirm infection, so the researchers have advised that those who have been in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
The Chinese estimate that the proportion of people without symptoms could be as low as 44%.
The incubation period (from infection to symptoms) is usually between one and 14 days, usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell was initially estimated at 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being worked out.
It is believed to be spread primarily by close contact and small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking, when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
During the study it was found that droplets can travel 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) due to coughing without covering the face.
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted from the tiny droplets that come out of the mouth when we speak, which can remain in the air for a long time. Although the virus is not produced in the air, it can be produced in the respiratory tract when we breathe, when we speak.
These drops can be passed into the mouth or nose of people nearby or drawn into the lungs with breath.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can spray the respiratory secretions in small amounts and thus spread through the air.
If a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth, it can spread.
Although there is concern that it can spread through semen, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through faeces or mouthwash. Although there is a possibility of transmission before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease, the virus is most likely to be transmitted within the first three days after symptoms appear.
People have tested positive three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that infection may be possible even before a large number of symptoms appear.
There have been few reports of unsignificant but lab-confirmed cases, but in the context of contact research, some countries have detected infection without symptoms.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is not entirely clear how quickly the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others, and the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
It has been found to be present on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for up to four hours.
However, this may vary depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched, such as animals, there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus that was first isolated in Wuhan from three individuals with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory syndrome.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies as its protective shell is dissolved by household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is basically closely related to SARS CoV.
It is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genus Betacoronaviruses is genetically clustered with variants derived from two strains including the subgenus Serbicovirus (Lineage B).
It has 96% compatibility with samples of other bat-related coronaviruses (BatCov RaTG13) at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only a single amino acid difference between the genomic sequences of rodent viruses and human viruses.
To date, 92% of the genome material shared by the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in whole genome comparisons, which is insufficient to prove that the coronavirus is the same intermediate host.
A virus infection can be diagnosed early on by symptoms but confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected trial.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan has suggested that CT, although less accurate, is significantly more sensitive than PCR, and many of its imaging features are consistent with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or used as a first test.
WHO has issued a number of regulations for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
This test uses real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a breathing tube or blood sample.
Results can usually be available within a few hours to a few days.
This test is usually done by sampling secretions from the upper part of the back of the throat, but can also be done by sampling secretions from the throat. Many laboratories and companies are developing blood-related antibody detection tests.
As of 6th April 2020, none of these tests have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Cellax in the US has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the specific imaging on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not show symptoms have unusual peripheral ground glass opacity and no pleural fusion.
International online data on imaging findings of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
Because of the association with infections such as adenoviruses, it is less accurate to use imaging in detecting COVID-19 without PCR confirmation.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that imaging, while less accurate at detecting infection, is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it should be considered as a screening tool in areas where the disease is widespread.
Convoluted neural networks with AI-based radiographs and CTs have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus.
The prevention plans include maintaining good overall personal health, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, using tissue when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of tissue directly in the trash.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised against travel from areas where the outbreak has occurred.
However, the virus has reached the stage of social transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community and some sections of the community are unaware of when and where they became infected. Healthcare providers who are caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard care, with care in contact and eye care. Tracking of contacts is an important method for health officials to identify the source of infection and prevent further infection.
The use of location data by governments on mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement to limit such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log the proximity of a privacy-conscious user to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spreading about infection prevention, for example, that cleaning the nose and flossing are not effective.
No vaccine is available for COVID-19, several organizations are trying to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if their hands are dirty, before eating and after snorting, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus dies with household soap, because household soap breaks through its protective layer.
If water and soap are not available, the CDC still recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum alcohol content of 60%.
WHO recommends not touching eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands.
Many solvents such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% powidone-iodine can eliminate surface contamination (the surface of stainless steel can be sterilized using only one minute of disinfectant.)
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium and crohexidine, are less effective.
The CDC has recommended that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place such as a nursery or nursery, disinfect all devices such as tablets, touch screens, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick persons in such areas.
Health agencies recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with a folded nook or tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may have been infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance travelled by droplets that are spread by breathing while speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is a major source of infection if hand hygiene is not adequate".
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks if they are at risk, for example those who are caring for people infected with COVID-19, it also acknowledges that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started to encourage the masks to be worn by the general public.
The CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of cloth in the U.S. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for public health care providers, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks in public or going out without covering their nose and face.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear face masks when entering grocery stores.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan has been manufacturing 10 million masks daily since mid-March and passengers will be required to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses from 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford to buy face masks make them at home.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at minimizing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The practices include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres or shopping centres.
People can implement social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching each other when greeting, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Several governments have mandated or recommended social distancing in areas where the outbreak has occurred.
U.S. government agencies and the Department of Health reduced the maximum number of people to gather from 250 (if the spread of COVID-19 is not known in the region) to 50 and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people in public places. The CDC advises elderly people and those with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension and compromised immune systems to stay at home as they face an increased risk of serious illness and disorders in areas where social outbreaks are occurring. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations began to use the term "physical distancing" to reduce the use of the term "social distancing" with the aim of maintaining social distancing or virtual distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" has resulted in people being completely isolated from each other in alternative ways rather than encouraging social contact. Some officials have issued sexual health guidelines during the global pandemic.
This includes recommendations to have sex with someone you live with who is not infected with the virus or who has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are recommended to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have provided adequate guidance on self-isolation, and many governments have ordered or recommended the isolation of the entire population living in areas where the infection has occurred.
The most stringent self-isolation guidelines have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
Those who have been in contact with a COVID-19 infected person and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread infection are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they were in contact.
Preventing or containing the spread and mitigating the spread are the solutions to control the outbreak.
Prevention is done at the early stages of an outbreak and is aimed at tracking those who are infected, isolating them, as well as planning infection control measures and vaccination to prevent spread of disease to other populations.
When the spread of disease cannot be prevented, steps are taken towards mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its impact on the health system and society.
Prevention and mitigation can be combined.
Preventing spread requires more tailored measures such as reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1 and reversing the global pandemic.
This reduces the risk of stress on healthcare and gives time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical precautions that can manage the outbreak include encouraging and involving the community to accept interventions such as hand hygiene, face masks and self-isolation, closing schools, banning mass gatherings, social measures aimed at physical distancing, as well as personal preventive measures such as cleaning of surfaces in contact with the environment.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and local quarantine, and warned to be vigilant about the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial assistance to those who have self-quarantined and has imposed penalties on those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and penalized stockpiling of medical supplies. Following the example of Great Britain and the United Nations, there are major challenges in mitigating (slowing down, not stopping) and preventing (reversing the spread of the epidemic).
The positive plans to reduce the spread of disease could reduce the high demand for healthcare by two thirds and halve the deaths, but still could lead to thousands of deaths and put a huge strain on the healthcare system.
Preventing or suppressing the spread may be a priority, but it needs to be sustained as long as the virus is spreading in the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens earlier), otherwise the infection will spread again after easing measures.
Long-term interventions to contain or contain the spread of pandemics have led to economic and social losses.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop them which involves testing of available drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting may help to alleviate symptoms.
The need for oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory assistance can seem acute.
The effects of steroid use can be exacerbated.
Several compounds that have been previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also stated that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Capacity building and optimizing healthcare for COVID-19 patients is a fundamental response to the outbreak, WHO said.
ECDC and WHO European Division have issued guidelines to take available resources for hospitals and primary healthcare to various levels including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, eliminating alternative methods where possible, isolating COVID-19 positive patients and increasing vigilance capacity by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case (called patient zero) may have been found.
The first case of this novel coronavirus can be traced back to Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1st December 2019.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They were mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals or in other words, it is an animal origin. A group of pneumonia patients of unknown causes was detected on December 26 and treated at Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhangyan Jixian, who told Wuhan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the "SARS-Tatsum coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenling, had been warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Mother Fan, had been strongly warned by her superiors for such a warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later issued a public advisory and informed the WHO.
Many cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health authorities, leading to an investigation in early January, with cases doubling approximately every seven and a half days during the early stages of the outbreak.
Due to the migration due to the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being a major transportation hub and railway switching point or junction, the virus spread to other provinces of China in early and mid-January 2020.
On January 20, China reported almost 140 cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had pre-existing symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in terms of the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97000 people have died and more than 364000 have recovered.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have reported at least one case.
As Europe has become increasingly globalized, many countries in the Schengen area have imposed restrictions on free movement and controlled borders.
National responses include containment measures (stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders and lockdowns) and quarantines. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown, more than 50 million in the Philippines, nearly 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion in two days - a figure that is one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan before December 1, 2019, with an unconfirmed case on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian had a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, after which his hospital reported it to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of the December 27 patient sample showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public advisory.
WHO was informed on the same day.
As the warning occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police about spreading false rumors about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In the latter days of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping later described as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
What has been described as "the biggest isolation in human history" was announced on January 23, with the sanitation chain halting inbound and outbound travel in Wuhan, which was later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital called Hushenshan Hospital which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built at the Lieshanshen Hospital to accommodate the surplus patients.
In addition to newly constructed hospitals, China converted other sites in Wuhan such as conference centers and sports grounds into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government took further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including a health declaration for travelers and extended spring holidays.
Universities and schools in the country were closed.
Several measures were taken in Hong Kong and Macau region, especially in the area of schools and universities.
Remote working arrangements were arranged in many parts of China.
Restrictions were imposed on travel within and out of Hubei.
Changes were made to public transportation and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement was curtailed in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) faced outside movement restrictions. When the outbreak reached global levels in March, Chinese officials took strict measures to prevent the virus from entering China from other countries.
Beijing, for example, mandated a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers arriving in the city.On 23 March, the only case of locally infected people in mainland China five days earlier was a traveller from Istanbul to Guangzhou.

In Australia, the pandemic has opened up new opportunities for daigu shoppers to sell Australian goods to China.
This action led to shortages of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite high COVID-19 cases and high demand for upcoming food, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
China and Italy have succeeded in stocking and combating the illicit trade in essential goods, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that were expected in Europe and North America.

In response, there was a strong push to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another rapidly closing trend is the cancellation of religious services, sporting events and other social events such as music concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced a setback, with the Vatican announcing that it has canceled the religious week in Rome, which falls on the last week of Lent, the season of Christian penance.
Many bishopric territories have asked devout Christians to stay at home instead of coming to Sunday prayers, some churches have made church services available via radio, online live broadcast or television, while others are offering drive-in worship options.
As territories under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic bishops of Rome close their churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square is emptied of devotees, other religious institutions have also suspended services and restricted gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
While Iran's Health Ministry cancelled Friday prayers in the affected areas and closed after the mass, Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from visiting religious sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused major disruption to the sporting calendar around the world since World War II.
Several major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have closed, and live poker matches have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers playing online, which has led to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Many music groups have postponed or cancelled concert tours, which has also affected the entertainment industry.
Many big theaters like Broadway have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have found ways to create and continue to share art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentation, such as live presentation of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and publicize their work.
There are many online memes about the coronavirus, many of which serve to create humor and distraction in this uncertain environment.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia, extreme prejudice and racism have been manifested against the Chinese people and the people of the East Asian region as well as the hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
In particular, in many countries in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been reports of fear, suspicion and hostility.
The February report (when most cases were still confined to China) included entries from across the world that expressed racial sentiments about whether the Chinese people deserved the virus outbreak or were getting what was claimed to be just retribution.
Some African countries also saw a rise in anti-China sentiment.
Many citizens of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on regional origin.
There is support for the Chinese people and people in the affected areas, both online and offline.
People in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19 after the outbreak spread to new hotspot countries, may also have been subject to suspicion and xenophobia. People in other countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially joined together to sign petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontKatuJapan has also been a hot topic on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in the UK and the US have reported increasing incidents of racism and assault.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term critics have called racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students from North East India, who come from China border areas and study in important Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State President in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "therefore God took their revenge".
The Chinese Embassy in Kolkata later condemned the move, calling it "defective". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been fueled by the pandemic, where foreigners are described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "disposal".
Currently, the newspapers with paywalls have removed some or all of their paywalls to keep up with the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific research on outbreaks freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on a preprint server like bioRxiv.
Emergent infectious disease - An infectious disease of emergent pathogens, often with an unpredictable outbreak or mode of spread

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and detecting the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is unique and is designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to detect very recent or active infection.
Antibiotic testing can be used for both serology diagnosis and close monitoring of the population.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very mild symptoms or those without symptoms.
The results of this test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate and immunity of a population group.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in their population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are wide variations in the number of tests performed between countries.
This variability is also likely to have a significant impact on the case for reported mortality, which is likely to be highly unrealistic in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be used to test respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Results usually arrive within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR test of throat sputum is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then be removed from the throat and continue to multiply rapidly in the lungs.
In the second week of testing of infected persons, a deep airway sample may be taken via a suction catheter or a post-cough component (thrush) may be used as an alternative.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) was developed at Charity in Berlin in January 2020 and was the foundation of 250,000 test kits made available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 28th January 2020, South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) which was approved by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
The test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for its PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit in China. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States is delivering the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-NCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel through the International Regent Resource.
One in three genetic test defects in the old versions of the test sets resulted in inconclusive results and hampered trials at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of 28 February 2020, the two-component tests were not considered valid, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization, and commercial laboratories in the United States began trials in early March 2020.
On 5th March 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 tests across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country.
No limits were announced on quantity; sample collection and processing should be done only in accordance with CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and manufactured by the State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology in Russia, Vector.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Healthcare Monitoring. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the test was developed by Mayo Clinic for detection of COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that can be done in large quantities in 3.5 hours, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's M2000 system; the FDA had previously granted such authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21st March 2020, Safid likewise received EUA from FDA for testing in approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can give a definite result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
Approximately 18,000 such machines are currently in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. The test, which uses monoclonal antibiotics that specifically bind to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus and is being developed in Taiwan, is expected to produce the same results as the Rapid Influenza Test in 15 to 20 minutes.
A March 2020 information review concluded that "Cross X-rays are less useful for early diagnosis, while CT [computed tomography] findings may appear before symptoms begin".
Typical features of CT include a bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification with a substrate asymmetric lateral distribution.
As the disease progresses, subplural domains, crazy paving and aggregation develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT at the current outbreak site in Wuhan has suggested that while CT is less specific, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR as it incorporates many of its imaging features into other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a test to detect or diagnose COVID-19 as a priority". The CDC recommends PCR for early screening by March 2020.
Antibiotics are produced, including IgM and IgG, as part of the immune response to infection.
The tests can be used to detect infection, determine immunity and monitor the population, either at a central laboratory (CLT) or through Point of Care Testing (PoCT), approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms.
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test these with large scale automated systems that are developed with a few processes in a specific time period, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
Although multiple samples can be used to track the immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
For POCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, pre-test extraction is not required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 ingredients that have advised the agency as needed and are therefore able to deliver their antibiotic tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one trial has been approved by the FDA under its emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, EuroEmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval from the European Community for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the background of the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is such that hundreds of samples can be tested in a few hours and therefore this test is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibiotics are generally detectable within 14 days of infection. In early April, England was unable to find any of the antibiotic test kits they purchased fit for use.
Hong Kong has a plan in which suspected patients can stay at home, "Emergency Department will give the patient a sample tube", they spit in it, send it back and within a period of time they get the test results. The British NHS has announced that they are conducting an initial study of a scheme to test suspects at home, whereby they do not risk infecting others if they come to hospital or need to use an ambulance to disinfect the patient.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea deliver the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country. In Germany, on 2nd March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians stated that they had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day in the mobile system, and had tested 10,700 people in the previous week.
When the doctor asks for testing, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the President of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to carry out a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
As of 19th March, the drive-in tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26th March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first survey in the laboratory found that up to and including the calendar week of 12/2020, a total of at least 4,83,295 samples were tested and 33,491 samples (6.9%) came back positive for SARS-CoV-2. Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and used a method to test 64 patients at a time, in which all samples were collected and only further testing was done if the sample was found to be positive. On 5 February 2020, the Wuhan Bihui (Chinese: "Emergency Discovery") opened a 2,000-square-meter laboratory, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Construction was completed in 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and this modeling has shown that had this testing capacity not been started on time, Hubei would have seen 47% more cases and the associated cost of quarantine handling would have doubled.
The Wuhan laboratory has been followed up by Huangyan laboratories in a total of 12 cities in China, namely Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As of 4th March 2020, the total daily throughput was 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design published by Origami Asage can test 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.
As of March, the scarcity and insufficient quantity of the reagent has been a barrier to large-scale trials in the EU, UK and US.
This led some authors to try a sample preparation protocol that involves heating samples to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was now testing for coronavirus in more humans in its population than any other country and was on track to raise testing levels to reach a larger population.
This was in conjunction with the purchase of drive through capabilities and wholesale throughput laboratories on a population basis from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of carrying out thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to have such a large scale outreach outside China.
Various testing activities targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO has adopted the German initiative to send manufacturing kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to manufacture their own.
Germany action was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed available testing in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits during the early days of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not supply enough kits to meet testing recommendations from demand and health experts.
On the contrary, the availability of large-scale testing in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The large scale testing capacity of private sector laboratories was built up by the South Korean administration over a period of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization ordered an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The massive spread of the virus has created a surplus of hundreds of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and a shortage of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
The test kit developed by the CDC in the United States had "defects"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers preventing private testing. Spain purchased the test kit from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found the results to be incorrect.
The company explained that the results may have been incorrect due to failure to collect samples or use the set properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would return the kits with the wrong results and instead give separate test kits supplied by Shenzhen Bioeci. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test kits purchased from China with the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 lakh test kits from China which were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the kits be disposed of on the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the kits purchased by Turkey from China had "a high degree of defects" and that they "were not used". The UK purchased 35 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
Testing, subsequent isolation of positive patients in the test and tracking of contacts of SARS-CoV-2 positive people, has yielded good results.
In the Italian city of Vovo, where the first COVID-19 death occurred, researchers conducted two rounds of testing on an estimated total population of 3,400 people, with an interval of approximately 10 days.
The average half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and those who tested positive were isolated.
By restricting movement in social life, new infections were prevented altogether.
With aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread much more slowly than in other developed countries and has not imposed extreme restrictions such as forcibly closing restaurants and retail establishments.
Several events have been cancelled and Singapore had begun advising citizens to stay at home from 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March at the scheduled time after the holiday period.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracking, domestic travel bans, testing and quarantine, but also through less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistics have shown that countries that have tested more than the number of deaths have a much lower death rate, probably because they have only detected people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO has recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first 10 negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 laboratories referred by WHO for confirmatory testing.
Out of the 16 laboratories referred, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The percentage of positive tests in the table below is influenced by the country's testing policy.
Otherwise, whether symptoms are present or not, the country will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, which is a country that tests only hospitalized people.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also called hand sanitization, is the act of washing one's hands with the intent of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted elements.
Washing hands regularly at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and strep throat, which spread through my hands and mouth.
People can also contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
The five important times of the day when it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after going to the toilet, after washing the baby's navel or changing the diaper, before breastfeeding the baby, before eating and cooking food, or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hand washing can be done with a washcloth. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or washing a child's ankle after going to a Sunday school.
After you sneeze, cough or sneeze.
After touching an animal, animal food or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medicine or seeking medical care prevents or reduces the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacterial, viral or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and harmful or disease-causing chemicals.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And home births include reducing infant mortality.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing practices could lead to minor improvements in the height gain of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by starting with simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea incidence by approximately one third, comparable to providing clean water to low-income segments.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence may be related to hand washing with soap. The practice of hand washing with soap, which is common in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the single most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs).
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is a leading cause of death among children under five years of age, causing an estimated 18 million deaths each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause an estimated 35 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, the built-in habit of washing hands with soap before and after eating and using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against infectious disease, which is spread through direct physical contact.
The minor side effect of hand washing is that constant hand washing can dry out the skin and damage the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause skin conditions like itching, discoloration of the hands, known as hand ulcers, which are common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times of the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of infection by touching your hands to your mouth: after going to the bathroom (shorts, diarrhea), after cleaning your baby's lap (changing lap), before breastfeeding, before eating and cooking, or before/after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper handwashing techniques should be followed to prevent the spread of disease include before and after treating cut or other wounds; after sneezing, coughing or rinsing the nose; after touching animal feces or after handling animals and rubbish.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is not as common.
In 2015, a study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing at 95%, the United States at around 77%, and China at the lowest rate of 23%. Some behavioral change practices are now being demonstrated, including the increasing use of soap at critical times.
The "Mandatory Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of action measurement for the advancement of children's health and education.
Disinfecting twice a year, washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth with fluoride, is a core part of the national programme.
This has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergent in water.
The main function of soap and detergents is to reduce the concentration of the solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not sufficient to cleanse the skin because the fats and proteins contained in organic soil are not immediately dissolved in water.
However, the purification is done by proper flow of water.
Because of the nature of our recycling, there is a chance that the solid soap may contain bacteria from previous uses.
Some studies on the migration of bacteria through infected solid soap have concluded that the bacteria are unlikely to migrate because of the destruction caused by foam.
The CDC still says "hands-free liquid soap is preferable for use".
Antibiotic soap has been heavily promoted among health conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of any antiseptic or germicide recommended for resistance to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotic ingredients like triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant stressors in organisms.
Therefore, antibiotic stress resistants are not chosen for pesticide soaps, although they may not be as effective as suggested.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective agents, refined formulations such as pH regulators may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), anti-inflammatory active benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (cornflowers, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that soaps are as effective at removing germs from infections as are conventional consumer trichlosan disinfectant soaps.
Hot water, which is comfortable for hand washing, is not enough to kill germs.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 degrees C).
However, warm water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing dirt and germs from the hands.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that warm water is not effective in reducing the microbe load on hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most of them are in gel form with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulation, or in wet liquid form such as glycerin, or in foam form to reduce the drying effect of alcohol and easy to use.
The mild hydrogen peroxide increases antibiotic activity. The alcohol content of hand sanitizers, at least 60 to 90 percent, is effective at killing bacteria.
Alcohol rub kills sanitizer bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some pathogens (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccina, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi
Alcohol Rub Sanitizer is 70% alcohol and kills 99.97% (a 3.5 log reduction equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and 99.99% to 99.99% (a 4 to 5 log reduction) of germs on the hands within 30 seconds of application. Hand sanitizer is very effective on some germs and less effective on some germs.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against germs like norovirus (or norvac), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Both hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to thoroughly clean hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the area between all fingers until liquid, foam or gel sand is present for about 30 seconds.
Wash your toes, rub both your hands, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you rinse your hands with hand sanitizer after washing when you see dirt on your hands.
The use of these agents is increasing due to their ease of use and fast microbiological action; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing when soap and water are not available.
Since repeated use of alcohol-based sanitizer can dry the skin, add skin softeners and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients have been shown to reduce skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antibiotic detergents.
Allergenic contact dermatitis, contact gallbladder syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or substances in hand rubs are rarely found.
The lower incidence of skin disease from irritating contact than from hand washing with soap and water was a significant attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not wash the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, because pathogens remain on the hands.
The efficiency of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formulation and has historically outperformed alcohol and alcohol rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and accumulated antibiotic activity, unlike alcohol, where after repeated use efficacy was shown to decrease, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income groups cannot afford soap and use ashes and dirt.
And the ashes of the soil can be more effective than just water but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it will increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, soil is a germicide because when soil comes into contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
The precise handwashing techniques recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or lukewarm running water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing basins can be contaminated, and the water temperature doesn't seem to make much difference.
Apply plenty of soap, rub it on your hands, put it on the back of your hands, between your fingers, under your nails, and then create a foam.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they wash their hands with water.
Wring your hands for at least 20 seconds.
It causes friction, which drives off bacteria from the skin, and it drives away more bacteria when you scratch for longer.
Wash your hands under running water.
Washing hands in a pool can contaminate hands again.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let the air dry them.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The thumb, wrist, the interphalangeal area, and the fingernail area are the areas that are normally torn off when washing hands.
Artificial nails and partially polished nail polish can provide shelter for microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Various low cost options for hand washing can be made where tap water and/or soap are not available e.g. if necessary in developing countries, pouring water with suitable holes from hanging jerrican or poppy seeds and/or using ash. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water conservation options such as "tippy taps" and other low cost options.
Tipping is a simple technique that involves hanging a can with a rope and a lever that can be moved by the foot to pour a little water on the hand and soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public washrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers found in most laundry rooms.
A study was conducted in 2008 by the University of Westminster London and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry to compare the level of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194 percent, and the number on the pools increased by 254 percent.
After the jet air dryer was dried, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42 percent, and the number on the bottom increased by 15 percent.
After washing and drying the hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76%, and the number on the nails by 77%. Scientists conducted tests to check whether the resulting contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment was likely as a result of each type of drying.
The jet air dryer, which blows out air from the unit at 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs out of the hands and the unit and contaminating the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot air dryer, the microorganisms spread from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread. A 2005 study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand-twisting methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying hands:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
When traveling, when soap and water are not available, hand washing wipes are an alternative to hand washing.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that their use reduced infection rates.
Medical handwashing is a minimum of 15 seconds, which involves using a large amount of soap and water or gel to sponge and rinse every part of the hand.
Hands should be folded together and pierced together.
If there is dirt in the nails, bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in the water on hands, it is important to wash hands and wipe them with a clean towel.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and open the exit door if necessary)
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by those surfaces.
In healthcare, the purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing in many medical settings remains unacceptable, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to microbial infections.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple practices can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure on hand washing and hand-washing in healthcare.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene by the institute can also be found on their website for public comment.
Whitby and others compiled the relevant reviews.
If demonstration of regular monitoring is required, professional tools can measure and validate hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization has a "five-minute" on handwashing:
The blood is a blood-borne disease that is caused by a blood-borne infection.
Before we started the disinfection,
After patient care, if soap is laced with antiseptic chemicals ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap), the handwashing liquid produces a killing reaction.
Such killing may be required before surgery or in areas with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms, surgical induction may require a hand-washing tube that can be turned on and off without touching, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a disinfectant towel to dry after hand washing, and a disinfectant brush for scrubbing and another disinfectant tool for finger-picking.
All jewelry should be removed.
The hands and wrists from the neck to the corners are usually washed for 2-6 minutes.
You don't have to rub for long (10 minutes).
When washing, water from the wrist to the corners should be avoided.
After the hand washing, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is applied to the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing was achieved by the first 20% of washing, and a very slight additional benefit when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
The rate of bacterial infection and spread of disease in food is more than three times higher when washing hands with plain soap than with antibacterial soap. Comparing the time of washing hands with an alcohol solution and the time of washing hands with antibacterial soap, at 30 seconds each, showed that the time spent washing hands with an alcohol solution was 26% less than the time spent washing hands with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashing liquid in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium from hard-to-reach hands. Interventions to improve hand health in healthcare settings may include training staff on handwashing, increased availability of alcohol-based handwashing liquid, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in various healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is becoming an inexpensive and necessary means to achieve better health and nutrition.
But the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made achieving universal handwashing behaviour a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, despite affordable options for installing hand washing facilities, there is a shortage of hand washing faucets near every private or public toilet.
However, poor hand washing can be more the result of dead habits than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and rewarding handwashing with soap can influence policy decision-making, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and change long-term population behaviour.
To implement it effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in LMICs, while social marketing initiatives are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which, among other hygiene needs, encourages schools to come up with simple, affordable solutions to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can eventually go from one to three stars.
The creation of handwashing facilities can be part of the efforts to promote handwashing to reduce child morbidity and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day, which seeks to change behaviour, is another example of an awareness-raising initiative. UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis in the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Some studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Dali.
But one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly cheaper than other water and sanitation interventions.
For people in particularly vulnerable situations - such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - the importance of hand washing for human health was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna, Austria, and "the English founder of modern nursing", Florence Nightingale.
At that time, most people believed that the miamas were the source of infection.
In 1980, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States more actively promoted hand-washing as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, murals showing "the proper technique of hand washing" were placed next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
Washing one's hands with something is a phrase that expresses one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to share its complexities.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but in some English communities the idiom came into wider use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her guilty conscience in an attempt to wash away the fictional stain of the crimes she committed and forced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that when immoral acts are recalled or reflected upon, people wash their hands more often than others and tend to attach more importance to the hand washing device.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after meditation are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" compensatory activities such as volunteering.
Religions require hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Using water to wash hands, but not using soap, is a symbolic hand washing, part of the ritual of hand washing, which includes the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilah in Judaism, Lawabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions require hand washing after certain acts, especially for hygiene.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards caused by COVID-19
Workplace hazard management due to COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health practices to prevent the spread of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper management of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and nature of work, which is dependent on the source of infection, the severity of illness in the community and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs involve minimal occupational contact with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular workplace cleaning and disinfection.
Moderate risk of infection includes work that requires superficial or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19 but who may have been infected due to ongoing community infections or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control for this group includes maintaining air circulation using high-performance air-filters, use of sneez guards and availability of personal protective equipment in case of exposure to COVID-19.
OSHO considers healthcare workers and mortuary workers who have been in contact with a known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high risk of infection, including those who are carrying out aerosol-producing procedures or collecting or handling samples of a known or suspected person with COVID-19, which increases the risk of exposure.
Risk controls suitable for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for that particular job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have many impacts on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns can change in both the sense of what is demanded and the way it is obtained (such as buying in low traffic or through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, the flow of goods from geographical areas that are severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The risk levels scheme addresses the various workplaces and occupations, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors and risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline contingency plans for emergencies and controls needed to address those risks.
Preparedness and response planning for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Objectives for an outbreak response include reducing transmission to staff, protecting people at risk of developing adverse health complications, maintaining business practices, and minimizing adverse impacts on other things in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease affects the response in the communities where the business is located.
The hierarchical framework of risk controls is widely used in occupational safety and health to group risk controls according to their effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are the engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally the personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employer or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All PPE should be selected based on the risks to the worker, fit for use (e.g. respirators) and be worn properly, be inspected, maintained and replaced as needed on a regular basis, and be removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-risk workplaces have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
It is recommended that basic infection prevention measures be adopted for all types of workplaces, including topical and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, observing respiratory etiquette including covering the face when coughing and sneezing, making available tissue and paper waste disposal buckets, preparing for telecommunication or regular shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Early identification and isolation of potential carriers is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show symptoms of a serious respiratory illness stay home for at least 24 hours without taking fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, as long as they have no fever, fever symptoms, and other symptoms, and flexible sick leave policies that allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of those policies.
According to OSHA, moderate infection risk jobs include those that require close internal contact of six feet (1.8 m) with people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business area, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a place where COVID-19 has been widespread.
Engineering controls for workers who have come into contact with the general public, such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail centres, and those at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increasing air hand-washing, introducing transparent plastic sneeze guards and a drive-through window for customer service. Providing temporary controls for at-risk and at-risk groups, providing virtual tools instead of face-to-face meetings, setting up various training schemes, providing a platform for people who need to work with COVID-19 prevention tools, including COVID-19 safety prevention, introducing a high-quality safety and safety education and training, providing a platform for people who need to work with COVID-19 prevention tools, and other measures to address the issues of workplace safety, including the need to communicate with the public about the risks of COVID-19 and its potential impact on their work environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person falls ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect the crew and other passengers include keeping the person at a distance of 6 feet from other people, assigning a crew member to serve the sick person and offering the sick person a face mask or telling the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue paper while coughing or sneezing.
Disposable medical gloves should be worn when serving a sick passenger or touching his bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces and if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing, the cabin crew should wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a biohazard bag and then the infected area must be cleaned and disinfected. For cruise ships and other passenger ships, including commercial ships, risk controls include delaying travel while sick and self-isolation while on board if fever or other symptoms are detected and prompt notification to the onboard medical centre.
Ideally, medical follow-up is required in the quarantined person's room. The CDC recommends that schools and child care facilities, whether or not they have community transmission, be temporarily closed for hygiene and disinfection.
Where there is at least moderate community spread, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as postponing field trips, crowds and other large gatherings including physical education or prayer classes or dining in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, changing arrival and departure times, limiting unnecessary visitors and setting up separate wellness centres for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is significant infection in the local community, schools may be considered for longer days of closure, including social distancing strategies. Law enforcement personnel who perform routine daily tasks are considered by the CDC to be at a lower immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with other individuals who are infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the period of care, staff should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning spray or wiper before re-use and follow standard procedures for disposal, separation and washing of used PPE for a controlled period.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high risk of infection.
High risk occupations include healthcare delivery, rescue, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of infection if staff are carrying out aerosol-producing procedures or collecting or handling samples from such patients.
Aerosol-making procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopes, some dental systems and examination or invasive sample collection.
High risk morgue work includes personnel involved in preparing the remains of persons with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of death; if they perform autopsies, they are at extremely high risk of infection. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include carrying out aerosol manufacturing processes, and isolation rooms for known or suspected cases of COVID-19.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary structures.
Samples should be handled with Biosecurity Level 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients who are suspected of COVID-19 should be isolated in separate waiting rooms accordingly. Along with other PPE, OSHA recommends that respirators be allowed to be used by personnel working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients and aerosol-producing process personnel.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or better respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory protectors can provide better protection and make staff more comfortable. WHO does not recommend full body protection, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through other secretions of the body.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be worn by personnel conducting screening at the entrance.
For personnel collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment without any aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face covers, gowns and gloves.
If the aerosol-producing process is performed, N95 or FFP2 respirators should be used instead of surgical masks.
As the global supply of PPE is inadequate, the WHO recommends using physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows, direct access to the COVID-19 patient's room by using only the PPE needed for specific work, reducing the need for PPE use for them, using a single respirator mask without separation while serving multiple patients with identical diagnoses, maintaining monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and providing services without encouraging the use of masks for those who are not in control.

Date/time of transmission: 14th March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a significant situation this month.
The global COVID-19 pandemic is one that illustrates the interconnectedness of global humanity and our responsibilities towards each other.
We have no prior experience of this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation and team building at the heart of our organization.
A remarkable proof of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with such amazing people is the kindness and care that is seen in all of our colleagues through email, phone and chat.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to call you my colleagues.
Last week, someone complimented me on my work.
He reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to read Wikipedia right now and how powerful a symbol it is to have this important resource online and available to everyone.
Whether you're keeping this site up to date or paying our colleagues or keeping your group safe, it's all because of your work.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, much more than Ervi.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it is going to have a meaningful impact on the world.
The importance of this campaign and your role in it will lead to some significant changes in the way we work together starting next week.
The Bible says: "The work of the righteous one is what he will do".
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our vision and timetable in the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we thought about what the right response would be to what we are facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We are keen to relieve stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you want to dial again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Our daily work expectation is about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can be used in this campaign.
But, the world is unpredictable at the moment and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
We don't need to say it, but we are saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team make adjustments to the calendar and schedule, ensuring that important parts of the work are completed.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please tell Brian at T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and ensure that your situation is properly addressed by management.)
Full pay will be given to employees who work overtime.
We have already said and reaffirm our commitment to respect our commitment to our contractors and our hourly staff colleagues.
Each will be paid according to his usual normal working hours.
This will include if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress about the world around them.
Especially in times like this, what we do can have incredible benefits.
Again, it's about you taking care of yourself.
We ask that you speak to your managers so that we know what to expect and can make changes accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we should keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising teams (amongst others) perform important tasks, which may require additional support.
We will start the process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and focus on supporting the essentials of our mission.
There is a lot of work to be done for all of you, let us focus only on the most important projects.
If you work slowly now, you will not lose later.
Once the global movement is over, we don't plan to work twice as long to get the job done.
You will no longer be expected to work overtime to meet unrealistic work schedules.
We accept that the situation has changed and when appropriate, we will work towards setting new goals and timetables.
What happens to the APP?
While adjusting expectations for our new realistic and daily working hours, our intention is to adjust the deadline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual planning.
Our intention is to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan, so that while including those people, it can give more time to the employees to prepare budgets to prioritize important tasks, take care of themselves and the care of their dependents, who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for shorter periods.
This extension of time frame will greatly reduce the ongoing planning workload and stress across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and as soon as we have confirmation we will update our representatives and teams on the next steps.
Thank the APP team for their leadership in this.
The office environment, infection and hygiene
Last week we learned that an employee of ours in SF-area has been suspected of being infected with COVID-19 virus.
However, with extreme caution, we have deployed a team of antiviral cleaners to disinfect all areas of the San Francisco office.
They use the same high-quality disinfectant solution used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the edges of the elevator that goes to our floor.
This building uses its own safety measures using products that help keep its tenants safe.
We are satisfied that when we decide to return, these offices will be fully operational.
Our DC office is located in WeWork areas, where we and all other DC-area employees have been shared their COVID-19 measures.
Last week, our D.C. office has been transformed into a fully remote set-up following guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC-area know, we're in talks to rent a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but we may be late.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Long-time remote colleagues know that this will be just an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit your meetings to one or two hours at the most.
If long sessions are needed, consider how they can be divided into several days.
Clearly explain the meeting schedule and send them the materials in advance.
To facilitate direct collaboration and connectivity, make these videos the default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
To facilitate each meeting, have someone lead it, who will monitor the chat for questions asked and check the list of speakers, and have someone else help take notes (or take notes in collaboration).
If you want a convenient headset, email the tech assistant.
Use your welfare payback for breakfast.
Join the #Remote's channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about your assignment.
The HR Operations team is looking to webinar based ergonomics to help increase the amount of work that is distributed across the organisation.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to postpone Wikimedia-funded mass events like "Editathons" until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we have learned that our request for delay and other restrictions would make it impossible to meet their agreed grant timetable, and also that no one would be punished for this delay and for changing that target.
Next week we will be tracking additional guidance provided for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community forums.
A common feeling of the global community is sad about this disruption, but at the same time it seems that both this clarity and the ability to focus on our own community, Wikimedia and others are pleasing.
Moving forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor this impact and track our communication with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will be sending an invitation in your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all in this together and we are here to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, please continue to receive information via this email and other important information about COVID-19 on the Office-Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a key workflow, or challenges under consideration, or anything else that you need help with, feel free to contact CRT and work with them.
We are here to help and cooperate and establish contact if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive material, please email Brian Judan, Director of Global Human Resources.
None of these changes should be seen as a dismissal or a constraint on our work.
Instead, they have to formally acknowledge that this is the moment when we need to take on our work and responsibilities in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to work together, so that we can keep working, provide for the needs they have, and provide them with the services they depend on.
These scheduled tasks will help you when the time comes.
For now, it is time to collaborate and make room for the important tasks that will be faced in the coming week and possibly month.
We need all of you to make this happen, so you need to take care of yourself and your family, so that you can give your best when it is needed.
Now please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The following are the names of the members of the leadership team: Catherine, CRT (Amanda K., Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.).
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys and intestines.
By reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of Ang ((1-7)), it opposes the action of ACE2 related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and thus is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallenzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type of mucous membrane protein that is activated by our enzymes on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extra cellular domain of ACE2 is broken down by a second transmembrane called the shades and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and finally dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is found in almost all organs: the membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and the smooth muscle of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an inhibitor of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I allows the hormone to enter the vascoconstricting angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 breaks down the carboxylic-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), also known as H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
[des-Arg9]-ACE2 can break down many other peptides including bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in cardiovascular disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, binding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the surface of cells by the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis and transfer of both virus and enzyme to endosomes located within cells.
Entry process also requires the priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This has led some to conclude that lowering the levels of ACE2 in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, patients at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and cardiac arrest, were also reduced in risk by treatment with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors were less strong than the overall risk of pneumonia, ACE use was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality.
Recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and has been shown to improve pulmonary hemo dynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In humans, rhACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours, and takes 30 minutes to start its effects, and its effect lasts 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or high-ranking diseases of imbalance angiotensin.
b-COVID-19 Apps are software applications in mobile designed to help in contacting, i.e. identifying persons who have come into contact with an infected person ("contact") in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks were developed to create contact tracing apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly in systems that track the geolocation of app users.
Less unusual options include using Bluetooth signals to log in with the user's other cell phone.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has jointly developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.
The app is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, it's called Trace Together.
The app was developed by a local IT community and made available as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia launched the Blue Tooth based app "Stop Corona" to contact potentially infected individuals and provide a fast response to healthcare officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Ministry of Health.
The app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store as of 14th April 2020.
The government said on 12 April 2020 that the app is in advanced development and will be available in a few weeks. A similar app has been added in Ireland and France ("Stop COVID").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth protocols. Russia intends to introduce a geo-fencing app designed to ensure that COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and a low probability of effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to a very small proportion of the population.
Expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, limiting this to "authorized" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed deep concern regarding the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The agencies announced eight conditions for government projects:
The surveillance must be "legal, necessary and standardised";
The extension of surveillance and surveillance should include sunset clauses;
Use of data should be limited for COVID-19 reasons;
Information security and anonymity must be secured and shown to be protected on the basis of supply;
Digital surveillance should prevent extreme discrimination and neglect;
Sharing of information with third parties should be defined in law;
The right of citizens to protect against and respond to abuse;
Meaningful participation of all "relevant stakeholders" including public health experts and marginalized groups is required. Checklists have also been issued by the German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of permanently removing tracking from their device operating system once the tracking system is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
Network based tracking was approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access personal location data; many privacy-protected systems have been created that use a central server only for intercommunication.
In South Korea, a system was used to introduce contact tracing that was not based on the app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system combined various tracking information including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to generate notices via text message to potential infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available, something that was allowed to happen due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, have considered both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
Details not disclosed as of 6th April 2020.
Privacy protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with research material dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user's intimacy with other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized approaches and not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy - proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and mechanisms for contact tracking to mobile (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all matches are on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePath, a platform to use privacy-protected techniques when collecting or using location or road junction data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research published in the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic". Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a privacy technology developer developed by Enigma MPC, which was originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure data hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5th April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by groups that had basically come together around a common approach and mostly overlapping protocols and their objective is to reduce fragmentation, enable the functionality of tracking and alerting apps, which is a key aspect of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy cryptography, which they claim will maintain privacy.
He also highlighted the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be broken down into three stages:
Rollout of tools to enable governments to create government secrecy - Protecting Coronavirus Tracing Apps.
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS, Android, Google and Apple is planned to address continuous monitoring issues by first delivering the system through operating system updates and then removing the threat again in the same way.
B'Drug repositioning (also called drug repositioning, re-profiling, retasking, or therapeutic switching) is the use of a drug that was originally approved for one disease or condition to treat another disease.
This is the only scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma infection for vaccine and re-infection. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drogeable proteins, each with multiple associated binding sites.
Analysis of such binding sites provides a good basis for the development of effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papane-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussain AA and others studied various candidate compounds and then analyzed their similarity in form to the same approved drug, which could lead to the development of a preclinical anti-SARS-COVID-2 potent drug and recommend it in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-epileptic drug used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial would include chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The FDA has not approved this treatment through clinical trial procedures and has authorized it under the EUA for experimental treatment only for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial.
The CDC states that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been validated.
Doctors have been told that this drug is used when "there is no other option".
A small study conducted by a Turkish research team in Istanbul, using chloroquine with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure is being tested by NYU Langone Medical School.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favipirvir is "fully effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative in 4 days, while 45 patients who did not receive the test had a duration of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipirvir and half received imifenovir.
The Pharmaceutical Institute of Italy reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is insufficient and elementary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for stockpiling, and with the help of the military, distribute it to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has been in formal talks with the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in patients with severe disease as the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (calletra), which combined the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
Drugs were developed to prevent the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is working on a new drug to improve the binding properties of the SARS-CoV-2 protein.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir showed intravenous antiviral activity against phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is that resistance develops from mutations that result in more serious diseases and infections.
Some previous pre-trial studies suggested that remdesivir may have a high gene resistance to resistance. Some clinical trials are underway, including two trials at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild disease and one for people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C administration to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 are underway; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan has planned to conduct a clinical trial of Tijin's Alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with novel coronavirus.
A Phase II trial on angiotensin-converting viruses 2 is underway, which will include 200 patients from critical hospitalization in Denmark, Germany and Austria.
The role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 is currently being studied by researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute, Canada.
The study, called Colcorona, is recruiting 6000 adults aged 40 years or above, who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant mothers and women who are not using effective contraception are not eligible.
Various anti-clot tests are being conducted in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being used to treat patients, which has encouraged medical institutions in Italy to publish guidelines.
A multicenter study of 300 patients was announced by Italy on 14th April to investigate the immunological and therapeutic doses of enoxaparin sodium.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention is being paid to the use of antiviral drugs that were previously approved for new targets in the MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus epidemics.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the China Guidelines.
Yumifenovir: Yumifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Some antibiotics were found to be suitable for use in novel treatment targets for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6-anti-receptor): approved by China
Also see trials in China and Italy and Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'A COVID 19 vaccine is a fictitious vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no clinical trials of any vaccine have been completed, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said at the end of February 2020 that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which causes the virus, is not expected to be available for 18 months.
A Phase I safety study was underway on five vaccine candidates in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The global outbreak in 2020 has triggered massive investment and research into developing vaccines.
Several organizations are using the published genome to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the CEPI initiative's priorities for developing a vaccine are speed, production capacity, scale planning and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists were informed that research and development was underway on 10 different technology platforms to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 in early 2020.
The key platform objectives in the framework I Security Study are:
Nucleic acid ((DNA and RNA) ((Early stage I developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Early stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino Biologics, Adenovirus type 5 vector)
A total of 115 vaccine candidates are in pre-development phase, with 78 projects confirmed to be in progress (according to the Milken Institute, 79), and 37 announced, with little information being made public (assumed to be planned or in the planning stages), according to information received by CEPI scientists in April.
Phase I-II trials are primarily focused on safety and antigenicity and are typically randomised, placebo-controlled and multi-site to determine the most accurate, qualitative dose.
Phase III trials typically have more participants, including a control group, to test the efficacy of the vaccine for disease prevention and to monitor for adverse events after adequate dosing.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 vaccines have not yet been evaluated in humans (still undergoing "preclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is exploring a potential molecular clamp vaccine that would induce an immune response by genetically modifying the virus proteins.

To develop and manufacture vaccines.
The partners also announced pre-clinical testing and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working on 11 isolates and that even working at a fast pace, it will take about one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Quebec City, Quebec-based biotechnology company, MediCago, announced that it had developed a coronavirus-like particle, partially funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
Laboratory research on vaccine candidate is underway and human trials are planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that UN President Donald Trump had indicated his willingness to pay Curevac "a large sum to obtain a single supply of COVID-19 vaccine", for which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Pre-clinical trials for the mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 are currently underway and clinical trials are expected in April 2020.
On 17th March 2020, in Italy, Taxis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that they will receive the results of the pre-clinical testing in April 2020 and the final human trial of the vaccine candidate will follow.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 to the COVID-19 vaccine research support team, bringing the total investment of CEPI to US$29 to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 with the support of Institut Pasteur, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
CEPI has been partnered by Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
Russian health officials announced on 20 March 2020 that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
The Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 COVID-19 medical response projects in late March, including various vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the MediCago and Saskatchewan initiatives.
At the same time, the Government of Canada announced C$192 million specifically for developing a vaccine for COVID-19, including plans to establish a national "Vaccine Bank" to be used in the event of a recurrence of the coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced that it was conducting a potential COVID-19 vaccine trial in mice, informing that "an effective antigen-specific antibody response of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine given by MNA was tested [in mice] with evidence starting to be obtained 2 weeks after vaccination".
The University of Waterloo School of Medicine, Canada, announced on 16 April 2020 plans to develop a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a fountain of Navacate.
DNA will be created using bacteria that will replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like molecules, which will stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, along with Amazon, Microsoft and Google, were jointly utilized by the United Nations government, industry and three universities to access IBM's supercomputers.
Some vaccines have an adverse effect, which can also be called an unintended effect.
This means that it can have other benefits besides preventing the disease.
A further 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomized trial in Australia.
The vaccine they are developing may not be safe or effective.
Previous research conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in COVID-19 specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals and primates other than humans, suggests the need for international coordination to ensure biosecurity-level 3 control measures and standardised safety procedures for handling live virus.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animals.
As of 2020, there is no cure for SARS in humans or a vaccine that is both safe and effective.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no standardised vaccine for MERS.
As MERS became more prevalent, it was hoped that ongoing research on SARS would provide a useful model for finding a vaccine and a drug for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, a Phase I clinical trial of a DNA-based MERS vaccine in humans had been completed, and work was underway on three other vaccines, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-Gamvac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media posts have sparked a discussion of the conspiracy that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents that emerged as evidence from various social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequences and vaccines of other coronavirus strains such as SARS corona virus.
b'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms to the onset of obstruction is usually five days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
The majority of patients have mild symptoms, while some patients develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 cases have been fatal.
More than 5,68,000 cases have been cured, and the virus is spread among people primarily through direct contact, often through coughing, sneezing or mouthwash.
These particles are expelled by the respiratory system and fall on the ground or surface, so they do not carry the infection over long distances.
It can also be transmitted to people by touching contaminated surfaces, touching eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus is alive on any surface for 72 hours.
It is highly contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, but can also spread in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages.RRT-PCR is the standard diagnostic method for NASGRA's real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
People with suspected infection and those who provide care are advised to wear masks.
The general public is given different advice on wearing masks, some officials are against wearing masks, while others are advising it and others are saying it is necessary to wear it.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19.
The majority of countries in all six WHO Regions have reported local transmission.
Patients with viral blockade sometimes have no symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
The immediate symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant chest pain or feeling of strain, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and a bluish appearance of the face and lips; urgent hospital treatment is recommended.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or a scratchy throat.
Some patients had less frequent symptoms of esophageal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Some patients in China initially showed symptoms of chest pains and heart palpitations.
Some patients have progressed to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but in some cases it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who developed symptoms were exposed 11.5 days after infection. Reports suggest that not all infected patients develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic vectors in the transmission is not yet clear, but from preliminary evidence they are thought to be involved in the spread of the disease.
The prevalence of asymptomatic cases is not yet known and is under study, while 20% of confirmed cases reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) are asymptomatic until hospitalization.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic patients in daily cases from April 1; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at screening.
Both spit and saliva carry a high viral load.
Speaking out loud produces more noise than normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that a mosquito can travel 4.5 meters (15 feet) without covering its mouth.
Although the virus does not originate from the air, the National Academy of Sciences has predicted that it could be a bioaerosol transmission and positive viral RNA has been found in samples taken from air collectors in people's outdoor areas.
Some medical procedures, such as tubal insertion and resuscitation of the heart and blood vessels, can release a source of secretion from the respiratory tract and thus spread through the air.
When there is concern about transmission through the vagina, the risk is considered low, and people with symptoms are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet fully understood how easily the disease spreads, it can spread from one person to two to three people, surviving on surfaces for hours to days.
In fact, it has been found to survive on paperboard for up to a day, on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99 percent copper surfaces for up to four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and varies accordingly.
Soap and detergents, when used properly, can be effective; soap products break down the thick protective layer of the virus, neutralize it, and isolate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other treatments, such as benzakonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a type of surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken within two days of admission to hospital.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest number of pathogens, and in the sixth patient, the highest number of pathogens were detected in the test taken the next day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel highly symptomatic respiratory coronavirus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the Wuhan Acute Respiratory Disease Center.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in its related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that creates its own protective bubble. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The most significant impact of COVID-19 is on the lungs, as the virus reaches the stem cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the second type of lung airway cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the stem cells.
Around 12 per cent of patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, have also been diagnosed with acute cardiac pain and it is common in severe illness.
The symptoms of acute cardiac injury are largely due to inflammatory responses of the body and impaired immunity during the course of the disease, but acute cardiac muscle injury may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Cases of blood clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) have been found to be prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients, possibly related to improper diagnosis. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage and inflamed white cells in the lungs.
Although SARS-COVID-2 has a tendency to infect with ACE2 cells of the respiratory tract, hyperinflammatory symptoms are seen in severe COVID-19 patients.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-inhibiting T cells were associated with appointment of inflammatory IL-6-inhibiting monocytes and acute pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Autopsies have also shown the penetration of white blood cells.
The World Health Organization has published a series of guidelines for testing for this disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the accepted method of testing.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples taken from the throat secretions, but respiratory secretions or sputum samples can also be used.
Test results are usually available within a few hours or a couple of days.
Blood tests can be done, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that detect the virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose ongoing infections and also tell whether a person has had the infection in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
The experience of testing in China has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point of care test for use later that month on March 21, 2020. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of disease status.
In early infections, bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and background distribution was common.
As the disease progresses, it may develop subplural dominance, strange pewing (lobelar septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and condensation.
There is a small amount of information available on the anatomy and micro-injury of COVID-19.
Here are some important points about autopsy pathology:
What the eyes can see: inflammation of the lung wall, heart valves, stiffness of the lungs, and swelling of the lungs
Four types of severe pneumonia are noted:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, overgrowth of lung cells, disproportionate growth of lung cells, interstitial inflammation with white cell infiltration, and the formation of polycystic large cells
Acute pneumonia: pulmonary failure and uncontrolled discharge from the lungs
Diffuse alveolar damage is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe oxygen deprivation.
Treatable pneumonia: Uncontrolled accumulation of secretions in the cavities of the lungs and interstitial fibrosis of the lungs
Blood: internal secretion into the arteries (disseminated intravascular coagulation); leukocytoblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you wear a towel over your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze, or if you don't have a towel, cover your nose with a corner of your hand.
It is advised to wash hands after coughing or sneezing of any kind.
The CDC recommends that face coverings be worn when walking in public places to limit infection from people without symptoms. Social distancing is aimed at reducing exposure of infected individuals to large crowds. Schools, offices have been closed, travel restrictions have been imposed, and large gatherings have been prohibited.
In terms of distance, people are advised to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other.
While no known vaccine is expected to be available by 2021, the key part of COVID-19 management is to bring the disease under control, also known as 'flattening the curve'.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when they see their hands are dirty, before eating and after touching their nose, and after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends that hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent alcohol be used, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizer products are not available, the World Health Organization has recommended two formulas for local manufacturing.
In these formulas, the antibiotic activity is produced by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to inhibit the growth of microbes in alcohol; it is 'not an active ingredient for hand disinfection.'
Glycerol has been added as a moisture preservative.
Patients are being managed through supportive care, which includes oxygenation, fluid therapy and other support to vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are carriers of the virus wear a plain face mask.
External oxygen therapy has been used to treat respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being realized.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Critical care and pulmonology experts in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies under a single open source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been identified.
Some medical professionals suggest using paracetamol instead of ibuprofen at first.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially during procedures that create sprays of physical fluids in the air, such as tubing or hand ventilation.
The CDC recommends that healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients should take general precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions, and keep such patients in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs).
Preventive equipment recommended for preparation: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be preferred over face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air, but, in other applications, their effect against a specific biological medium cannot be guaranteed.
When masks are not available, face coverings or homemade masks may be used as a last resort, as recommended by the CDC.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require medical ventilation or other alternatives, but a small percentage of cases are.
The type of medical respiratory assistance available to patients due to respiratory obstruction due to COVID-19 is being continuously studied for people in hospitals.
It is not yet known whether either of these treatments are equally effective in patients with serious illnesses.
Some doctors prefer aggressive mechanical ventilation treatments, if available, because they limit the spread of airborne pathogens compared to a ventilation tube. The incidence of serious illness is very high in elderly people (especially those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Even in many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, so the sudden increase in the number of severe cases of COVID-19 could limit the capacity of the health system to handle the issue of hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of the total patients were admitted to ICU, 2.3% of patients needed technical support for external ventilation, and 1.4% of patients died.
About 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China had to end up in the ICU.
As acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes more complex and oxygen delivery becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control capability and high PEEPs are needed to reduce the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by ventilators while providing a high oxygen supply.
Older ventilators may not have high capacity PEEPs available.
Research on potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing trials since then.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
Although it will take until 2021 for new drugs to be developed, many of the drugs that have been tested have been approved for other uses or are going through further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization participate in trials to study the efficacy and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has provisionally approved the use of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical trials to determine if they are effective and safe treatments for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can show 'close contact' from the observed data and thus understand the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the app suggests self-isolation and informs local health authorities. Big data analytics on cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to monitor infected patients and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government instructed security services to check the mobile phone data of people who are suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with infected civilians.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telecom provided the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, with the collected location data of the phones, which will be used for virus prevention and research.
Russia has installed facial recognition technology to track people who break the quarantine.
Regional Health Commissioner of Italy Julio Galleria said that they are getting information through mobile phones.
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 partners.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kirsty Karlulaid, has issued a global challenge to take concrete measures against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, adverse treatment effects, or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress and economic decline are the root causes of threats to people's mental health and well-being".
These conditions may have few or no symptoms, which is similar to other respiratory diseases such as colds and coughs.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, whereas severe cases can take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on information on other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, it can be said that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but there is no information on COVID-19 in this regard. COVID-19 can affect the lungs in some people, causing pneumonia.
COVID-19 can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severely affected people, resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure, etc.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver, etc.
6% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients have been found to have impaired blood clotting, increased prothrombin time, and 4% of these groups have been found to have impaired renal function.
Nearly 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been found to have elevated liver enzymes.
The same report stated that the time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which 5 days were required for admission to hospital.
However, the time between admission to the ICU and death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the median time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) said that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of post-mortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage along with cellular fibromycoxide in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The pulmonary picture was consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
High troponin levels or cardiac arrest were found in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to the March report of the US, 89% of people hospitalized had some pre-existing complaints. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic status of the area also affect the mortality.
Regional distance changes the estimate of mortality in this situation, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Reducing the number of mild cases could lead to higher mortality estimates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of past exposure may mean that the current estimate of mortality is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than nonsmokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
Hong Kong hospital officials found that some people who had recovered from the disease had a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity, and lung scans showed that organs were damaged.
This is a potential cure for post-ICU syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who had recovered from the disease.
Based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, immunity is likely to be seen, but cases that have been reported positive for coronavirus after recovering from COVID-19 in the next few days.
It is believed that such cases may be prolonged rather than recurrent.
The virus is believed to be natural and originated from an animal and spread through infection.
Its exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January showed that 1 December 2019 was the earliest date for symptom onset.
The official release by WHO has listed 8 December 2019 as the initial date of onset of symptoms.
Various methods are generally used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and from time to time and are influenced by the number of trials, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the duration of the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
During the final period of 2019, WHO has assigned an emergency ICD-10 code of U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and a disease code of U07.1 to laboratory-unconfirmed clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed deaths from COVID-19. The death-to-case ratio displays the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which displays the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and they are based on a specific population infected by the case version.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may be an indication of how many people are infected.
In the small town of Castillon d'Adda, at the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, 4,600,80 (1.7%) people have died so far.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and spread among young people, which led to a comparatively low mortality rate and may not be the case for all COVID-19-related deaths formally classified as such.
Besides, the German health system is not so burdened.
In the Netherlands, perhaps about 3% of people may have antibodies, as reported by blood donors.
69 (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality of this pandemic are different for women and men.
Studies conducted in China and Italy found that men had a higher mortality rate.
Men in their 50s are most at risk, and the gap between men and women in mortality has been the lowest since the 1990s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of these gender differences is unknown, but it may be genetic and behavioral.
Sex-based immunity gaps, lower smoking prevalence among women, and the development of co-morbidity such as high blood pressure in men at a younger age than women, may all contribute to higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government was not obtaining gender-gap data among COVID-19 infected individuals.
The research found that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
The WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General, Dr. Tendros Edhanom Ghebreyesus, said that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of this disease occurred in Lakshmi: 31st December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, following international naming recommendations, and with the aim of avoiding stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communication, WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19".
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as interim names for the disease, following the 2015 guidance against using place names for the disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of the standard inadequate series capacity, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials as needle swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, when a hospital in Italy was in urgent need of ventilator valves and the supplier was unable to supply them in time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, misinformation and distortions about the origin, extent, treatment and other aspects of the disease were created and spread rapidly online.
Humanity has been able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccine and drug is ongoing by the government.
In March, WHO launched a "solidarity trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most effective existing antiviral compounds.
While no vaccine is available at present, various agencies are actively developing 'vaccine candidates'.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurons to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccination strategies have been developed.
First, the researchers' goal is to create a complete virus vaccine.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether it is an inactive or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the immediate immune response of the human body.
Another strategy is subunit vaccines, which aim to create a vaccine that makes the immune system susceptible to a specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus differentiate the ACE2 enzyme neurons.
A third strategy is about nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, an innovative technology for making vaccines).
Any of these three strategies require testing of an experimental vaccine for safety and efficacy.A clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers was initiated in Seattle on March 16, 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent conservation has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Seven trials were being evaluated from already approved treatments for malaria, including four investigations on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese research involves multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine trials on Phase III of Remedicivir being conducted in several countries, according to a report submitted in late April.
According to the April 2020 report, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is underway. Several existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remedicivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/RaiTonavir and Lopinavir/RaiTonavir with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence for exposure to Remedicivir.
Patients treated with Remedicivir had clinical improvement.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, this research requires a collective review.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram, noting that doubling the dose is extremely dangerous and can even be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, raibovirine or umifenovir for use against CORONA-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of raivovirine are needed to contain SARS-CoV-2 in the trial.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further testing after demonstration of low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early spike protein priming via transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 penetration via interaction with the ACE-2 mechanism.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have had major difficulties preventing the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and has not been found to have any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokin storms can be complicated in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
Evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties has led to the inclusion of tocilizumab in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
Following positive outcomes in people with serious illnesses, phase 2 non-randomized trials are underway nationwide in Italy.
Combining serum ferritin with a blood test to identify cytokine storms, it means resisting such developments, which have been considered to cause death in some infected people.
In 2017, a neural antibody to interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA based on a preliminary study conducted for the treatment of a steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome in mice, called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosilezumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Research is ongoing on the transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 to people in need as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it didn't have any significant effect.
Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action, by which passive antibody therapy against SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are under development, for example, using synthetic monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convolutional serums, which contain the fluid proteins of the blood of recovered patients and which contain antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for rapid growth.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Dr. Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, contracted COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus and died.
