Rapid increase in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the EU/EEA and UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The rise in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is showing similarities across EU/EEA countries, and the UK has stated that while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly in all countries.

On December 31, 2019, a case of rheumatoid arthritis, the cause of which is unknown, was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been named as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

14% of cases of COVID-19 evolve into severe illness requiring hospitalization, while 6% have severe illness requiring the most intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.

At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the count of reported COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
All these data were used in the COVID-19 epidemiological evaluation in EU/EEA countries as well as the UK and compared all these data with data from Italy.
As a representative of active COVID-19 pandemic cases, we calculated the sequential occurrence of COVID-19 cases that stabilized at 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 infection in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also showed the increase in the number of individual cases reported on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in the European Union/EEA and the UK
The trend in COVID-19 cases that occurred over a period of approximately 14 days in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is following the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the incidence of COVID-19 outbreaks began to rise around 21 February and then sharply increased on 28 February 2020.
This was largely driven by the rapid rise in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the European Union/EEA and the UK have shown a similar rise in the progressive rise of COVID-19 events.
Figure 2 shows the total surplus of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The report notes that as of 15 March at 8:00am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom reported a lower number of cases, compared to the number of cases in Italy, which was only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the countries of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The observed trend in the occurrence of COVID-19 shows that the pandemic is evolving at a relatively similar pace in all countries.
This is in contrast to countries that are in different stages, changing national public health responses and different case definitions in countries, and different ceremonies for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including testing.

Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not disclosed).

The study carried out in 201011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and medium-range nursing beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (average 12.5 care places and nursing beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
The model scenario for healthcare disability is given in the ECDC's sixth new Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19, with estimates for EU/EEA and UK countries that COVID-19 admissions are at risk of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds by &gt;90%.


️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As indicated in the new ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, adequate and comprehensive response approach is essential in delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2- with a shift from containment to mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to learn, accept and respond appropriately if not implemented early and promptly.
The early risk assessment also incorporates public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window in which countries can further step up their management efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare institutions.

The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophic human deaths.
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from mosquitoes and causes similar symptoms through a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV.
COVID-19, however, has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and affects older people more than younger people, and men more than women.
To respond to the growing number of publications on the spreading disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research topics.
We will talk about the basics of disease, its causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.

The virus is similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the other related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak first started in Wuhan, China, with rapid spread across the country and to about 50 countries around the world.

The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one" and has the potential to outpace terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, including virus studies, infection, cause, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on 7 January 2020, which identified isolated viruses from multiple pathogens.
The review attempts to summarize the evolution of research in a rapidly evolving new discipline.

We will also discuss what we have learned regarding prevention and prediction of disease as well as questions we need to answer urgently.
CoVs are usually considered harmless pathogens to humans, most of which cause the common flu, about 15% of influenza 4.

COVID-19 is currently the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a batch of pneumonia patients of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later the sequence of the coronavirus (CoV) was released.

SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread to most of Hubei Province and its surroundings.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is approximately 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basal seed continuum (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the R0 correction is 2.23-4.82.

The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the coordinated mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age 60 and older, and those with severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses, or CoVs, are large, rounded-cranial viruses that contain a single RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, alpha-beta-gamma and beta-beta-CoVs, and are known to be transmissible to humans.
The spike (S) protein binds to the receptor 2 enzyme-binding molecules angiotensin A (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and subsequent fusion of the compounds occurs.
The RNA gene is then transferred to the cytoplasm. After the virus is broken down, the RNA gene, surrounded by glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms tiny water molecules that dissolve with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new variant of the beta-CoV with a genetic identity of over 99.98% in 10 sequential samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Wuhan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short-chain protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the release of IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or pattern.
18 Feb 2020  and others reported a cryoEM structure of ACE2 with a full human size of 2.9 A with a complex containing B0AT1 of amino acid transporter.
They found that it is a complex of open and closed conformations fed as dimers, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex binds to two S-proteins, all of which provide evidence in the recognition and virulence of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Ji et al. suggests that elephants are the carriers of the virus from bats to humans, involved in the recombination of similarity in the S protein.
According to a study, a team of researchers in Guangzhou, China, showed that the long-beaked, horny-tailed, long-nosed, long-nosed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned-tailed, horned, horned-tailed, horned, horned-tailed, horned, horned, horned, horned-tailed, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, horned, and even.

The biochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not well known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and they survive for 5 days at below 20 degrees and a humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may be similar in nature.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was resistant to ultraviolet radiation and heating at 56 °C for 30 minutes. Ethylene (ethane) 75% ethanol disinfectant, chlorophore perocetic acid and other non-chlorhexidine fatty acids can inactivate the virus.
The global population is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.

So we just looked at previous studies on other CoVs, specifically the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV (Figure 4) 4.

T-lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the body's defense.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to form a special antibody to a specific virus, and CDC8+T cells kill the virus themselves.
T-helper cells produce proinflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokines to aid in the immune response.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The human immune system, including C3a and C5a receptors and host cells, is also crucial in fighting viral infection.
For example, tissue taken from recovered patients has restored MERS-CoV to normal.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a substantial amount of free radicals in the nucleus, which can cause severe damage to the liver and other tissues, and in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cluster of symptom onset, is more likely to affect older, sick adults and pregnant women.
It's common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have a weakened immune system to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most being 3-7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the duration of the illness was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
Another new study, as described above, showed the duration of the disease to be 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective screening timing based on the most accurate wake-up time, so it protects those who are infected but have no symptoms from transmitting that virus to others.
As a normal practice, individuals who are infected or infected with the coronavirus are usually required to undergo a 14-day laser scan.

Patients with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory illness and severe fever, despite the absence of abnormalities of pulmonary imaging, should be screened for germs for initial diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the proportion of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for acute and 3% for cancer, and 8% of patients needed an inlet air supply.
Similar studies have shown that two recent studies of a family and a cohort of people caused by infection from asymptomatic individuals.

80% of these patients require more ventilation than COVID-19 patients and are similar to MERS, which is more deadly than COVID-19.
Carrosis (26%) and MERS (21%) were also observed in patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️



The previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 virus was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV virus was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of its morbidity and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The figures above show that SARS-CoV-2 is more capable than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in spreading, but is less deadly than the latter two.

The patient may have a normal or decreased number of lymphocytes in the early stages.
For example, lymphocytes with a 4×109/L blood cell count, including 1×109/L lymphocytes and the presence of the virus in the blood, and elevated amino acid surfactant levels of aspartame were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and electrocyte sedimentation have also increased in the blood of some patients.
In severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a degraded product of fibrin, in the blood are elevated and the number of lymphocytes is gradually reduced.
Abnormality in chest X-ray imaging has been detected in most COVID-19 patients and is characterized by double-blind mirrors or a slight mirror on the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, vertical lung injury and symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The irregularity of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and increases the surface tension, thereby reducing lung capacity, which is unable to grow and increases the risk of lung damage.
The worst chest X-ray detection results are therefore often consistent with the most severe of the disease.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via trans-transcriptase polymerase (RT-PCR) has been used as a key diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

It is known that cyclone Zytochyn is caused by a strong immune system reaction to SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine cytocin is a form of systemic inflammatory response expressed by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the root cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients with severe conditions.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, which are IL6 monoclonal antibodies, are used to treat cytotec.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokines include T-cell-directed immune response coordination, inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF, inhibition of JAK, use of the drug blinatumomab, inhibition of cytokine-releasing signaling 4, and inhibition of HDAC.
Steroid, antifungal drugs have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severe relapse that affects inflammation.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe liver injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, particularly osteoporosis, which affects the prognosis.
However, short-term use of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids is recommended with the utmost caution for severe COVID-19 patients.

Additionally, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with mild respiratory symptoms.
Renal irritation, nausea, liver cell damage and other activities may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interactions of these treatments with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.

For example, the body can override the immune system response and trigger the release of cytokines, which can lead to lethal toxicity.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low and requires a lot of plasma to treat patients with severe levels.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific organisms fast enough to fight the spread of the disease worldwide.

TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.

The majority of the active ingredients are still unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and store such ingredients or to preserve them optimally.

For example, the herbal medicine Zofengidu and the herbal medicine Huangjingwen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
It was observed that the highest recovery rate in treating COVID-19 patients was in some provinces in China, with 87% of patients using TCM, of which those from Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxi (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei, which used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
This is a quick comparison, however, as many other factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bullitcheng and colleagues published a study to compare Western-style therapy (WM) alone with combined therapy between WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for the baseline body temperature return, symptom resolution, and hospital stay for the WM+TCM group was shorter than for the WM group.
The rate of symptom worsening (from mild to severe) was noticeably lower for the WM+ TCM group than for the WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the low mortality rate for the WM+ TCM group was lower than for the WM group (8.8% vs. 39%).

It is also interesting to define the mechanism of action and to establish the efficacy component of treatment by TCM or its combination therapies if possible.
Pasientes que sospechan o confirman tener COVID-19 son, en su mayoría, extremamente temeros de la infección y pueden ser potencialmente mortales, y las personas que están aisladas también son muy nerviosas, solitarias y enojadas.

The mandatory exposure monitoring and quarantine, which is part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may cause some people to become depressed and misinformed about the impact of the infection, quarantine and vaccination on their family and friends.
Should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected COVID-19 patients and their contacts, as well as the general public who are in need of care.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of a multi-professional mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on treatment plans and the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and the use of professional electronic devices and software to avoid close or overly intimate contact.

In most cases, patients can make a full recovery without any problems.
COVID-19, which is similar to SARS and MERS, has also been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.

Based on past empirical studies, some of the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age is the most important factor for predicting the likelihood of SARS and COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs predominantly in people aged 30-65, with 47.7% of patients aged over 50 in the 8,866 case study described above.
Patients who require high care are more likely to have moderate and moderate outcomes and are older than those who do not (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a determining factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males than females (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Confusion and disorientation: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from painful cardiac arrest and severe cardiac arrest.
Heart problems are still the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could penetrate ACE2-positive cholangioctues, causing impaired function of the liver of COVID-19 patients.
It should also be noted that age and pre-existing illness are strongly correlated, potentially causing mutual effects.
Laboratory anomaly finding: CRP levels in blood reflect the severity of inflammation or wounded ligament and have been proposed as a predictor of possible disease, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 is also cited.

These enzymes are widely expressed in many tissues, especially the heart and liver, and are released during renal failure.
They are therefore a common symptom for heart or liver failure.
Key Experimental Treatment Symptoms: Chest X-rays and the time evolution of symptoms from experimental treatment should be considered along with other issues for predicting outcomes and consequences of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune-degrading agents that are used in combination therapy for certain infections to reduce the severity of inflammation.
The use of high doses of corticosteroids is used to treat severe SARS patients. Survivors have suffered vascular and bone loss that has resulted in lifelong disability or reduced quality of life.

️Stress: As described above during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have experienced unusual stress as they endured prolonged and intense stress, uncertainty, and seeing the death of close family members and other patients.

The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the phase of decline will last 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter and others have predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected both near the nasal cavity and the ventricles of patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be in a flu-like phase.

It is possible, because of its similarity to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 can weaken infection and eventually re-disintegrate or become a virus that causes disease that is rare in humans.

SARS-CoV-2 has a high rate of transmission through coughing, sneezing, or direct contact with objects containing the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, raising the possibility of new infections from feces to the mouth.
A new study on 138 cases reported that 41% of total cases were probably caused by hospital-acquired transmission, with 17 patients having a relapsed disease, including 40 healthcare providers.

The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing masks. Both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (version # 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
The surgical barrier protects the fluid from individuals who are susceptible to infection, preventing the fluid from traveling through the air or falling on the surface of other objects where they can be passed on to others.

China's disease control agency may be taking this hard lesson and making bold improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements, because all words matter to citizens and it can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be cautious and respond better to irregular information coming from clinicians rather than waiting for an official report from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive to contain possible outbreaks at an early stage rather than trying to deceive the rest of the public; and (4) more frequently in practice implement targeted and effective trials to increase public awareness of the disease and to improve the public health and response systems on a regular basis.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus started in late December 2019.

However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS which are necessary for preventing spread and for treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates for patients who are very old are also higher than for younger people.
SARS was more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus to others even if they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients are asymptomatic when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's normal RNA strand may not be present in some COVID-19 patients.

How long will this pandemic last?
How did viruses evolve during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic or disappear like SARS or reappear like the bubonic plague?
It's important, but it may take some time to do research to answer the above questions as well as others.

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shifted the focus to show how dangerous and life-threatening HCoV infections are.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has put the virus back on the hot spot and has surprised us with its high prevalence but instead with a decreased pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are a zoonotic virus (animal-to-human), and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs can help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, which are not pathogens.

More importantly, we compare and contrast HCoVs and the theory of the evolution of the virus as well as the recombination of its genes.
The current 2019 COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, they also emphasize the need for successful mutation and the impact of the virus evolution on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of RNA viruses that are single-stranded, pseudonucleated.
These viruses are encoding the largest 26 to 32 genes, the lobes in the viral RNA, which are called CoVs because of their electron-like structure in the electron-based micro-genome.
Structurally, CoVs have a segmentless sinosome that is under a uniform layer.
About two-thirds of the xenome has two large, parallel chains (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are transferred to the old polypeptide enzymes pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein is further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, designated by nsp1~16.
The remainder of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The helper proteins of some strains are also encoded by different strains of CoVs.

Evidence that clones humans, plants, and insects suggests that bats and insects serve as the genetic source of the most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant habitat of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.

Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute respiratory illness, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East embryosed respiratory disease (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 often cause mild symptoms such as common diarrhea and/or rash.

HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal effusion of patients with the common cold from the mid-1960s.

The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating in modern history, infecting over 8000 people and having a total mortality rate of over 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory disease outbreak has been spreading non-stop in the Arabian Peninsula with a worldwide spread.
The 2019 (2019-nCoV) novel HCoV, renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), which killed more than 3120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The voices are ringing and the world needs to prepare for the impending SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of genotoxic origin from bats, ants or domestic pets.

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a serious medical, scientific, social and moral challenge for China and the world.

In particular, we noted and discussed a topic that said that the original strain of HCoVs is not pathogenic when it lives in its original host, but it turns pathogenic after it has been transmitted to the new host.
We also reviewed the hypothesis of HCoV evolution where an increase in transmission can occur frequently with decreases in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
CoVs in animals have been known since the late 1930s.

A summary of the sequence of HCoV detection (Table 1) will provide information and guidance.
HCoV-229E was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.

The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those of HCoV-229E, which are characterized by no distinct symptoms from infections with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and they tend to be more commonly transmitted in the winter in temperate climates.
The average duration of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of illness.
According to a human voluntary study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E evolved into the common cold.
Only patients with weakened immune systems exhibit severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as  Uncommon pneumonia, was the first recorded HCoV-caused pandemic in human history, and the pathogenic biological agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS may have occurred as early as late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
As a result of the SARS outbreak, 8,096 cases have been reported, with 774 deaths, with outbreaks spreading to many countries and continents.

SARS-CoV patients initially experience muscle aches, headaches, fever, fatigue, and vomiting followed by wheezing and shortness of breath, which are subsequent symptoms.
Lymphedema, decreased liver function and increased creatine kinase tests are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
SARS patients were observed to have multiple lung tubes ruptured, rapid epithelial cell growth, and elevated blood clots.

HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant from the Netherlands during late 2004.
It was first found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, and its peak incidence is in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a cough and flu-like illness known as Croup's disease.

Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide causing moderate transmission.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to cause high pathogenicity, although there have been cases of unknown cause, such as in the rare case of the HCoV-NL63 subtype, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.

MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed rare pneumonia and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.

Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by a rare, progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also evolved into renal insufficiency, which is unique for MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
Over 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 low respiratory infection as a public health emergency of international concern and has also named the disease COVID-19.

Noteworthy, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the percentage outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, coughing and fatigue.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into a severe respiratory crisis.

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but it can spread more rapidly compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
They reported asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six HCoVs groups reveal similarities and differences of remarkable benefit.
First, the awakening and evolutionary durations of HCoVs are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general classification of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is dependent on SARS-CoV and the four groups of HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the other hand, has shown some characteristics similar to community infection of HCoVs, with little or no symptoms.
In other words, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can be seen, as in SARS-CoV infections, although with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 replication also reveals an interesting pattern of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs obtained from the community.
SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, at least has a high transmissibility as community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is still to be reassessed whether there has been a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infection after transmission to other humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the test specimen.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can show up seasonally as well as community-acquired HCoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, it may be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, they could both have been survivors of the HCoV pandemic since ancient times.
HCoVs that cause severe human disease and human mutations to severe HCoVs are eliminated.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In this sense, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak gets longer and more people get infected with it, it will have a greater chance to adapt to humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

These viruses do not need to be present in animals.

They need to preserve and breed in their zoonotic habitat and seek opportunities to spread to susceptible prey as far as possible through evolving intermediate and mature species.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and all four subtypes of HCoVs.
It spreads as quickly as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is still seen to fully integrate into humans and run inside humans without the need for a toothbrush or a midget toothbrush.

Animalia behave as an evolutionary counterpart to HCoVs if they are closely related to a common ancestor at high levels of the blue-green sequence.
The older virus usually adapts well and does not affect the younger ones.
Likewise, the HCoV storage area will remain for a longer time.
In both cases, the pathogen is usually infected and either the natural pathogen of the HCoV or its original pathogen.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The central nervous system is the source of animal-to-human transmission and acts as a mediator by allowing the viruses to differentiate themselves and then spread to humans to further spread the virus.
HCoVs may stop transmission if the virus cannot spread beyond its host.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can adapt to medium-sized and long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the middle ear becomes the natural rectum.
Data from epidemiological studies have previously indicated that SARS outbreaks have a history of interaction with animal-related gambling.
Results from blood samples showed that animal traffickers have higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG resistance compared to the general population.
Pets and rodents sold at live animal markets were the first to be identified as containing SARS-CoV-like viruses, which are almost completely identical to SARS-CoV.
It is supported by the fact that no further SARS cases have been reported after killing all the animals on the market.
However, it has been reported that wild or farm-raised cattle with no exposure to live market are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV, suggesting that cattle may only act as intermediate growth vectors but not natural hosts of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to calculate the possibility that many microanimal species could serve as primary vectors of SARS-CoV.
All of this looks like the last remaining container of SARS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibody and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This virus and other mouse CoVs account for 88-92% of the similarity of nucleotide gene sequences.
These studies laid the groundwork for the new idea that bats are pathogens for humans.
They also identified several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) from bats, but only one identified WIV1 that could isolate as a live virus.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from bat semen samples has been shown to be used in bats, bats and humans with ACE2 receptor for cell insertion.
It is interesting that serum serum (SERA) from SARS patients is capable of inducing WIV1.
WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing a 95% nucleotide sequence.

Biogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same groups as bat CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a single receptor cell, peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closely related to the beta-CoV counterpart in bats identified from Europe and Africa.

MERS-CoV and CoV-HKU25 in bats, its closest relatives, share only 87% of the blue nano sequence.


The living MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from a Mediterranean octopus nasal sample, further suggesting that the octopus acted as a true host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that although the symptoms are generally mild, there has been a strong viral transmission observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected bats transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also via the mucous membrane to the mouth, which is also an important channel for transmission of the virus from bats.

SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% similarity to the RaTG13 CoV in bats isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence matching between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so large that it is not possible to determine the causal relationship.
It is possible that bats are not the primary host of SARS-CoV-2, unless CoVs are found in bats with nearly identical identities in the future.
Theorized that the SARS-CoV-2 primate should be among the wild species sold and killed at the Hunan seafood market, where most of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked, indicating an event of animal-to-human transmission.

The CoVs in these new cohomes have a similarity of nucleotide sequence of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.

They secrete two small strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the embryonic gene pool, one of which has a receptor cell similar to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acids.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are different, although the same sequence of genomes has a higher affinity.

The study used different assembly methods as well as particle amplification of a single part of the gene, which is approximately 86.3% of the virus's genome size.
We cannot count wild animals as a continuing counterpart for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is typically shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in rodents.
They still cannot establish the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, wild boars and other animal hosts.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There is a strong speculation that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in reptiles and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by co-evolution that is selectively correlated.
The challenging proposal is to replace the combination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV in the wild and RaTG13 in the third wild species.

It was reported that a bat-borne CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was found in a North American tricolor bat that showed similarity to HCoV-NL63.

For clarity, current knowledge about the origin of HCoVs in animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.

It was found that alpha-CoVs in bats are closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpha-CoV alpaca.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First, humans, not alpacas, can be attracted to bats in shared biology.

The second bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are mutant and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in non-animal bodies.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that infect humans, including the mad dog virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Gender virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Alpha-CoVs in bats act as the genetic component of HCoV-229E in Alpacas and Mediterranean monkeys, and may act as intermediates in transmitting the virus to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of animal-to-human transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at its initial identification, and it has been expanded upon through subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich source of viruses for the interchange of genetic fragments and for transmission from one species to another.
Longevity, large colonies, close migration and high flight capability are the prerequisites for bats to become the greatest 'virus-spreader'.

It adapts well to these camels, which have changed from medium-sized to common parasitic reptiles.
MERS-CoV causes severe morbidity and maintains a low rate of mutation in these animals.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Beta-CoVs, in particular, are highly pathogenic in poultry.
They may be the last host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to the monkey in the case of SARS-CoV.

First, bats may be a stock analogue of SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Secondly, wild boars may be part of the central pathogen where the SARS-CoV-2 related virus was first transmitted.

It is possible that many animals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Third, as described above, the recombination and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a tertiary animal species associated with bats and bats.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals is ongoing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First, atria are highly variable in terms of their RNA replication.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated replacement rate of CoVs can be classified as medium to high with an average replacement rate of 10 to 4 replacements per year in a site 2 depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new strain.
CoVs have a nuclear exonuclease that has a suppression-control function, resulting in hyperplasia and reduced or even disabled reproduction.
Remdesivir is known to inhibit the self-replication of CoVs by inhibiting the enzyme exoribonuclease and the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most successful SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agents tested in clinical trials.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Furthermore, the rate of mutation is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the pathogen.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thypertonically, it is unlikely that genetic engineering will produce a rapidly effective SAES-CoV-2 vaccine and antiviral.
Second, the large RNA xenome in these CoVs is highly adaptive, which is beneficial in differentiation and replication. Therefore, mutations from one species to another can occur, which are beneficial in the emergence of CoVs at a suitable time.
It is supported by a complete, differential-readable, and functionally transcoded protein towards the final 3rd xenome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change patterns during RNA fragmentation through different  replication selection mechanisms.
In mice that serve as a route of synthesis, threading occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Strong full-length similarity and sub-synomic RNAs can combine to form a new CoV.
Evidence of evolutionary recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.

Based on comparative analysis between human and mammalian SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different host, particularly with changes in the RBD of the S protein.
RBD in the S-protein of CoVs interacts with cell receptors and is selective in response to human immunity.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptor cells of various animals including dogs, mice, rats, rats and dogs that allow for virus transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been observed to be distinct from human and civet virus isolation in RBD, and all 4 of them are located in the receptor cell binding site for interaction with the ACE2 receptor cell.
SARS-CoV in rodents has mutations of the genes K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the likelihood of interaction of large-spectrum proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
The replacement of these two amino acids may be important in transmitting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 isoform of the S protein suggests that the affinity of its S protein to humans with ACE2 may have been altered.

It is also interesting to determine whether other receptor cells can be targeted for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

There are neurons for the reception of other HCoVs, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans following animal-to-human transmission from their animal host.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The differences in host proteins between humans and the natural host of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary bats and rodents may be a barrier to transmission between species.
HCoVs must capture host dependence and modify host binding factors for successful cross-transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in the main interaction of the virus remain to be identified and characterized.
The unusual genome sequencing of the pathogenicity and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR may have had a positive outcome.
New HCoVs: Back to zero
The concentration of CoVs in bats provides a wide range of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as the genome of HCoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, acquiring or losing genes that encode new proteins has the potential to dramatically modify the protein genes.
ORF8 of the SARS-CoV variant was identified as being important in human adaptation similar to the SARS-CoV virus isolated from bats, but was found to have differentiated ORF8 proteins.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The deletion differentiates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, which are understood to be self-transformative, inducing translocation of the carrier.
SARS-CoVs also interact with alpha and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small reservoir regions are known in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The recombination site is also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and various parts of nsp14.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Selective selection should be done with caution as it can cause unintended viral mutations which can be caused by viral degradation through selective stress such as the immune system of the peer.
An example of these effects is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E line of models caused by the deletion of two nucleotides.

CoVs are not pathogenic or they only cause symptoms in intestinal tract such as the intestine and the intestine.
They reproduce robustly without triggering a strong maternal immune response.

Most chronic symptoms are caused by a decrease in the immune system and the number of cytokines, whereby an increased immune response leads to more severe lung damage.
On the other hand, if you are infected but have no symptoms, it means that the immune system has not yet been activated in relation to the shedding of the coronavirus.
The same strategy in blocking the immune system response could be effective in treating against SARS-CoV-2.
The anti-pheromone response is particularly strong in bats.

SARS-CoV-2 is a common cause of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Beta-CoV shares 95% of the same nucleotide as SARS-CoV that we found. Similarly, Beta-CoV shares 96% of the same nucleotide as SARS-CoV-2.
The market caps and other animals have been found to contain the same virus as SARS-CoV, but the direct intermediate for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
They found that beta-CoVs in bats are very similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bats could act as one of several carriers, or that beta-CoVs could help provide genetic input to the next generation of SARS-CoV-2.

CoVs have returned to normal due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of animal-to-human origin and HCoVs storage sites in human transmission.
Spread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via the central nervous system.

To stop the recurrence of MERS, a methodology should be developed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for ducks in conjunction with other infectious disease control measures.
n't we can eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge, causing an outbreak.
CoVs, which are transmitted from animals to humans, are roaming in the forest.
The CoVs in bats, which can be transmitted from animals to humans, are distinct.
There are many opportunities for these CoVs to evolve or re-emerge, causing new CoVs that could cause future transmission and death.
China should abandon its wild-eating culture in parts of the country to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Better preparedness and response planning should be in place with the painful experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
actually, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They're stuck in their normal state until they get a chance to fake a replica.

For example, the Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Disease issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020) issued a total of seven publications, some of which were substantially modified.
Now, our guidelines have been argued by Zhou et al. They suggest a simple scoring based on their clinical experience.

We support their important work and thank them.


Epidemiological history: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (2) History of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) History of contact with fever patients or with withdrawal symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 infection was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (4) History of contact with fever cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or infection occurred within 2 weeks, such as in a small school area).

We can see that the polymerase chain reaction test for nucleic acid in urine or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogenicity of blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and then the evidence from blood analysis was included in the seventh edition.
These changes depend on researchers continuing to work to find the best nucleic acid detector for rapid diagnosis as well as samples from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increase the availability of different samples and help bring positive antigen results into the infection diagnosis.

Zhou et al.'s flowchart should therefore be updated because they classified people without clinical symptoms as at low risk.
The scoring system also needs to be integrated into more practice and clinical studies.
To conclude, we hope more firsthand evidence will come along and invite readers to provide their feedback.

These changes were made in accordance with the four-tiered one-time purchase limitation measures introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 November, respectively.
"In its March 8 media release, Coles Modern Market reported that with the four-package limitation, ""many stores are still sold out within an hour of delivery"" and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI Modern Market called it unanticipated in a Facebook post on Tuesday".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales have increased significantly in the past week.
Costco's Canberra store also set the allowable quantity to two packages last week.
To reduce shortages, Coles ordered large packages from suppliers and to speed up shipments, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI created stock for projects intended for specialty batteries in advance.
Australia's Retailers Association president Russell Zimmerman said retailers were trying to bring vans into stock, but local council restrictions on truck entries were making it difficult.
He expects the original cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand and have less specialized skills.


He noted that toilet paper is a two-piece item, which leads to a limited stock volume, and when sold out, leaving a large storage space, leaves a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News thatColos and Volvo had the view [that] if there were lots of items on the wall, if products like toiletries and detergents could be bought and in quantity, you might be able to reduce the fear a lot.
Who Gives a Crap, a company that makes recycled paper bags, said Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue and Solaris paper and makes customized toiletries, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to a report by News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that a real estate seller gave free toilet paper to the first bidders at a Melbourne auction when two or three bids were made as buyers were off on Labor Day weekend.

Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including face masks, hygiene masks, dry products, hand dryers and mushrooms.
Similarly, this Sunday afternoon outside Australia, the UK online marketplace Ocado was observed to be restricting the purchase of paper for Andres bottles up to 12 packages.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic.

All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said that if countries find out about the testing of vaccines, isolate them and mobilize their populations in response.
We are deeply concerned both by the level of emergency declaration, the extent and severity of the emergency and the level of emergency of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the spread of the pandemic is "unprecedented".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Ghebreyesus expressed similar sentiments, saying We have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus before.
He continued, " And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled all at once".

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "It's going to get worse".

The 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak is a continuation of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.


The case fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while for the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Treatment is symptom-dependent and supportive.The recommended precautions include washing hands, mouthwashing when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolating those who suspect they are infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, bans, workplace hazard screening, and lockout.
The pandemic has caused global economic, social, political, cultural and religious events to be postponed or cancelled, and panic, supply shortages, and panic-driven shopping.

The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, the poultry coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV. The first infected individual was later found to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the individual was not in direct contact with the group of viruses found in the raw materials market.

On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case occurred on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, probably the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that recent cases were reported to have declined in China, but immediately there was an increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases in China for the first time.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed as positive, according to the official ceremony.

A study published on March 16 found that in China as of January 23, approximately 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and these unrecorded infections were the source of transmission for 79% of recorded cases.
Statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basal gene sequence number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.


For countries with no time to progression, the time to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common time being 14 days.


The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher as it does not count people who died without testing - e.g. at home in a care facility.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We know [the death toll] is a staggering one, a statement confirmed by reports of unnumbered deaths in the US. Such staggering is common when there are epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

These figures vary by region and time and are influenced by the size of the diagnosis, the quality of the health system, the time since the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health. Reflections on mortality rates divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given time period.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

In China, estimates of the mortality ratio have decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning on January 110, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case-death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who die from the disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infectious (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Some studies have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Centre estimated that the infection mortality rate for the entire pandemic was between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimates are consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and the study is based on the impact of the test on the CFR estimates.
WHO has claimed that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end times of the outbreaks are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated that with the remaining general lack of control, the outbreak increases and then begins to decline once the disease is gone.


On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene suggested that SARS-CoV-2"may continue to circulate for one or two years".
"According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be necessary ""until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or longer) """.
William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University, said, "I think it's probably impossible that this coronavirus, because it's already ready for transmission, will not go away completely, and it will evolve into a seasonal disease, possibly returning every year".
The strength of a possible rebound will depend on the immunity of populations and the magnitude of the variation.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists early symptoms as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or sudden confused pressure, difficulty waking and facial or oral bleeding. Emergency medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, symptoms of obstructive respiratory syndrome, diarrhea, muscle wasting, and death.

China's estimate of the ratio of non-disclosure is as low as 44%.
The typical wake-up period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one day to 14 days, with a general incubation period of five days. The uncertainty factor estimates the proportion of people with COVID-19 who initially lose their sense of smell to be 30% and later fall to 15%.

The disease is believed to be spread primarily during close proximity and by small droplets produced during coughing or talking, with close contact being between 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have found that uncontrolled coughing can cause saliva to leak 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets that remain in the environment for long periods of time, which can be generated during speech.Spout droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted by air.

Certain medical procedures such as intracranial blood transfusion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory arrest that removes mucus and can cause airway transmission.
It can also be spread when a person touches a foreign surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.

The overall comparison of genes found that almost 92% of the genetic material shared between the bats and the SARS-CoV-2 virus was insufficient to confirm that the bats were moderate hosts.
Virus infection can be diagnosed provisionally based on the initial symptoms, although final confirmation must be done by positive polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the transcribed material or CT scan.
A comparative study between polymerase chain reaction and Citrate in Wuhan showed that Citrate is more reactive than polymerase chain reaction, with many of its features overlapping with pneumonia and other pathological processes, although not specific.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has released a multi-serum RNA test for SARS-CoV-2, with the first release on 17 January.
Testing using rRT-PCR.
Testing can be done on a respiratory or blood sample.

The test is usually performed on a nasal swab, although a nasal swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing a fluid-detecting test for the organism.

In the United States, silicone-based fluid tests are only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.

The Italian Radiological Society is collecting international online data on visual detection for confirmed cases.

A large study in China compared chest CT test results with PCR and pointed out that although the images are less specific for transmission, they are faster and more responsive, suggesting that its tests are a screening tool in epidemic areas.
The solution-based neural network of the artificial brain has been developed to capture images of the virus with both X-ray and CT imaging.

Anyone who may already be infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.

This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some community members are unaware of where and how they are infected. Health care providers who are caring for someone who may be infected with the virus are advised to use standard precautions, contact and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.

Users will receive a message if they have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are being propagated about how to prevent infection. For example, washing the nose and mouth with poisoned mouthwash is not effective.

CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least two minutes, especially after taking a bath or when hands can be seen to be soiled, before eating, and after rubbing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by the in-family soap that blows its immune system.
CDC further recommends using hand washing with a minimum of 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
1%, isopropanol 50100%, sodium ipoglulite 0.1% hydrogen peroxide 0.5% and iodine propionate 0.27.5%
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that if a suspected or confirmed case of COVID is found in an office or daycare setting, such as a bathroom, a shared space, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreen devices, touchpads, touchpads, and ATMs used by patients, they should be disinfected.
WHO recommends that people cough and sneeze with a handkerchief or use a mouthwash when coughing or sneezing and throw away the paper immediately.

In the United States, the CDC recommends masks made from non-medical masks. China specifically recommends that the public, especially those in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or more) with others, use disposable medical masks.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when people are travelling in public transport or when in crowded locations.
Thai Health officials encourage people to make masks from masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia ban going out in public without wearing a mask or having something to cover the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam suggested that you wear a face mask when going out in public to protect yourself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone entering the shops must wear a face mask.
Israel recommends that all citizens wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing tens of millions of masks a day since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and buses to wear masks by April 1.
Panama has required the wearing of masks whenever outdoors and has also recommended the manufacture of handmade masks for those who cannot afford to buy masks.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.


Individuals can practice social distancing by staying home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using non-contact social distancing, and isolating themselves from others.

The maximum gathering size recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (if there was no spread of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 and later to 10.

The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the effect that people should be in a state of complete social isolation rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through other means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with those with whom you live who do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having the disease.
The Health Agency has issued detailed guidelines for proper quarantine. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
Self-isolation recommendations are issued to those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with a high prevalence of infection are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of last exposure.

Crime requires more aggressive measures to prevent outbreaks by reducing the number of outbreaks to less than 1 percent of control.The spread of infectious diseases is trying to slow the maximum rate of spread known as the iron curtain of outbreaks.
This reduces the risk of healthcare being difficult and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment.

Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has imposed mass surveillance and quarantine on a baseline and issued a travel advisory for infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial support for those infected and quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who did not comply.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and imposed penalties on the purchase of medical supplies. The figures for the UK and US show that mitigation (slowing down but not stopping the spread of disease) and containment (slowing down the spread of disease) are major challenges.


Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have caused social and economic damage.

Too much cold medicine, water and rest can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the outcome.

The World Health Organization also states that some traditional and home remedies may provide relief from symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
Capacity building and adaptation of healthcare for COVID-19 patient populations has been described by the World Health Organization as a primary response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO in Europe announced a shift for hospitals and primary healthcare services to a multi-pronged resource shift, including a focus on testing services for COVID-19, eliminating early screening, isolating and self-isolation of COVID-19 patients, and enhancing capacity for intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.

The first known case of the new and isolated virus may have occurred on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Belgium collected 100,000 non-recyclable masks, which were thought to be imported from China, but in fact were imported from Colombia.

The World Health Organization has commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, in which Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hindered containment and management efforts, and the current situation, in which the central government has given regular updates to avoid confusion ahead of the Chinese New Year.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC is due to the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries without robust healthcare systems.

"️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tedros made further statements, declaring that "all nations, if one is weak, are all weak", and urging the international community to "invest today, not to lose more later".In a press conference on February 11, the World Health Organization named the disease COVID-19.

"The UN Crisis Management Team is in place, which in turn allows for the coordination of the UN-wide response, which the WHO will allow them to focus on the health response, while other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the socioeconomic and evolutionary impact of the outbreak".


Mike Ryan, director of WHO Emergency Programs, reminded in a statement that this is a reality check for all governments in the world: Wake up.
"The virus may be on the move, so you should be prepared, stressing that the right response measures can help the world avoid the worst outcome".
Ryan further stated that the current data has not been formally verified for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean ""we recognize in principle that every person on the planet is going to be infected with the virus""".

WHO has been severely criticized for its perceived lack of adequate response to the pandemic, including the strict declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing performed with pneumonia is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear back into the pancreas as it travels to the lungs.
For infected individuals tested in the second week, replacement samples can be taken from the deep respiratory tract with a cardiac catheter or a cough suppressant.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and generated a base of 250,000 base pairs for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by 23 January 2020; the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a treatment class based on the SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) instrument PCR on 28 January 2020.
"The method searches for the ""E"" gene distributed by all coronavirus and the specific RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval for a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based detector from China's National Medical Products Administration.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) chain reaction diagnostic kit to the National Institutes of Health for clinical trials".
One of the three genetic testing kits in the older generation of testing yielded uncertain results due to errors and complications of testing at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully run throughout February 2020.

"The March 2020 literature review concluded that chest X-rays are of little value in early stage diagnosis; whereas CT detection [imaging of any site of body tissue] may be present even before symptoms appear"."
Common features on CT include smoothness of the bi-directional lens with back partitions, irregular shapes, and material.
The large number of excesses under the pulmonary artery, the ring-like structure and the ligament develop as the disease evolves.

"March 2020 the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used for imaging or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initiation of follow-up".

These can be used to identify individual infections starting at 7 days or after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Testing can be done in a laboratory (CLT) or by focus-on-testing (PoCT).
The high-throughput automation system in many pathology laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but the availability of this system will depend on the production rate for each system.
For single samples that replace transfusion blood, CLT is often used, although a sequential sample can be used to monitor immune system responses.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by scalp.
Unlike PCR, the extraction step is not necessary before ingestion.

The test capacity is hundreds of samples in just a few hours and is therefore faster than the claims of PCR of RNA viruses.
Typically, DNA can be detected within 14 days of the onset of infection.Early in April, the UK found that none of the DNA test kits it purchased were of sufficient quality for use.

In March, the lack and insufficient amount of conversions became a barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to seek a five-minute sample preparation ceremony involving heating the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) to extract the RNA gene for further testing. On May 31, it was announced that Saudi Arabia is testing more of its population for the coronavirus in the head than any other country and is on track to expand the scope of testing to reach the majority of the population.
"This is through a combination of leverage and the purchase of a large laboratory from the population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Hu-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China)".

This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce stroke by about a third, and this is comparable to clean water supply in low-income areas.
48% reduction in asthma can be linked to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent asthma and ARI infections, a practice that should be practiced in facilities, schools and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.

According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before eating and after bathing a life-saving practice is more than any vaccination or medical intervention by cutting deaths from cancer by almost half and deaths from respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitary interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene programme.

Alcohol-based hand washing or hand sanitizer is a waterless hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, waterless hand sanitizer, alcohol (also known as alcohol washing, hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropylene alcohol or ethanol forming together with raw agents such as carburetor (a polyester material of acrylic acid) into gels or other substances such as glycerin into liquid or foam units for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohols.
Adding the chemical compound hydrogen-peroxide increases the activity of disinfection. Hand wash containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol is effective enough to kill bacteria.

A small number of studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with DALYs.

The importance of hand washing for human health, and especially for those in vulnerable situations such as mothers just giving birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand sanitizers, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.

In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne and healthcare-related infections led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand sanitization, a key means of preventing the spread of infection.

Washing your hands to wash something means either declaring no responsibility for something or sharing integrity in it.
It originated in the biblical text in the Gospel of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a proverb with a wider use in some English communities.
The character Mabel in the comedy begins to clench her hands by attempting to clean up the mess of fantasy that represents her sense of guilt for the crime she committed and urged her husband to commit.
They found that people who remembered or thought about immoral behavior were more likely to think about washing their hands and more likely to value hand washing devices.

Some religions claim that hand washing is for preservation of anonymity and symbolism in other purposes. The symbolism of hand washing using water without soap is part of the characteristic of hand washing in some religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. All of these religions also specify that one should wash one's hands, especially after a specific activity.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after eating.

️Monitoring workplace hazards depending on the workplace and occupation, based on risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of the individual employee who may be susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), workplace exposure to low-risk workplace exposure with the public and other coworkers is recommended to use basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, routine routine procedures, and maintaining the hygiene and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate risk occupations include those who require frequent or close contact with people who do not know or suspect COVID-19 but may be contagious through ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workplaces, and some high-end retail locations.

OSHA considers health care and funeral staff known or suspected of having COVID-19 at high risk by direct exposure, which increases the risk if staff performs routine autopsy procedures or collect or dispose of samples from people known or suspected of having COVID-19.
Risk management for these employees includes engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation and work-appropriate personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak may affect some workplaces.

The trade record can vary both in terms of what goods are demanded and the means of obtaining these goods (such as by walking around shopping at peak hours or by means of transport or driving services).

Plan for addressing the level of work-related risks and missions, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from housing and community settings, and individual employee risk factors such as age or mental health conditions.
They also specify the management needed to address those risks and plan for the emergency situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response to infections may be the subject of national or subnational recommendations.

Engineering management involves keeping employees out of work-related hazards regardless of worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative management is the change of work policies or procedures that require action from the worker, employee or employer.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some challenges.
All types of PPE must be selected based on hazards to workers, be properly fitted as practicable (e.g. respirators), be properly fitted and properly checked, regularly maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent transmission.

Infection prevention measures recommended for the workplace include frequent and inadequate hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory symptoms including cough and wheezing, providing toilet paper and toiletries, preparing for the communication line or changing the veins if necessary, not encouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining the hygiene and disinfection of the work environment.
Identification of infected individuals and quarantine are important steps in protecting employees, customers, guests and others at the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness must rest at home until they are free of fever, chronic fever and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking a painkiller or other symptomatic medication, and that the sick leave policy is flexible, allowing employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees should be aware of those policies.
According to OSHA, moderate risk occupations include those who require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of a person who is unknown or suspected to have COVID-19 but may have SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community infections around the business location or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to a location with a high prevalence of COVID-19.

Carriers should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or contacting bodily fluids and may have additional personal protective equipment if the passenger has a fever, constipation or respiratory distress.
Handcuffs and other disposable items should be disposed of in fuel-free lifeboats, and surfaces containing liquid should be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard management includes delaying travel when sick, isolating oneself, and alerting the onboard medical center immediately if anyone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.

OSHA considers some health care and funeral home workers to be at high risk.

These have become highly challenging if staff perform procedures to generate ventilation or collect or hold samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The procedures for the separation of solids or liquids into gases include injection, exfoliation, pulmonary imaging, dental procedures and examinations, or the collection of infectious samples.

Specialised negative air pressure may be appropriate in some health care facilities and cemeteries.
Samples should be carefully stored in advance according to biosecurity level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated into different waiting zones depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. Additionally, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients and those who are undergoing airway procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or better facial respirators are used in the context of a broad spectrum of respiratory protection programs, including appropriate testing, training, and medical procedures.
Alternative respirators can provide greater protection and improve the well-being of staff.WHO has not recommended a procedure for wearing a mask as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended surgical masks for entry control personnel only.
For those collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without solids or liquid gas separation procedures, WHO recommends the use of medical masks, eye shields or face shields, eyeglasses and gloves.
The process of creating a solid or liquid-to-gas quality separation was implemented. The rubber mask was replaced by the N95 or FFP2 mask.

ACE2 is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of the cells of the liver, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and stomach.
ACE2 opposes the activity of an enzyme called actin-like enzyme (ACE), which is involved in reducing the number of actin-II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a successful drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses.
The human gene is often referred to as hACE2.
Enzymes for the synthesis of enantiomers are iron-containing proteins that are located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 is encoded by the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-thyminal-cholesterol-dependent acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I protein channel whose enzyme acts directly on the surface of liver cells and other cells.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is secreted from the transcriptional domain by another enzyme known as shades, the resulting dissolved protein subunit is released into the bloodstream and ultimately released into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most tissues: ACE2 is bound to the cell walls of type II cells, the liver, cells of the small intestine, vascular and endothelial cells, and the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels in most tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also present in the outer membrane of the striatum, hypothalamus, and brain cells.
ACE2's primary function is to act as a counterbalance regulator to ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone antigen I into the blood clot antigen II.
ACE2 clears the carboxyl-terminal amino acid from two angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and breaks it down into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also kill a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] - the drugs bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 helps in the modulation of the synthesis of SLC6A19 and S amino acid receptors seen in Hartnup's disease.
As a transcriptional protein, ACE2 serves as a critical entry point into the cell for several infectious viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
The S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 is more clearly translocated into the ACE2 enzyme present on the cell surface, resulting in the virus and enzyme's dissociation and localization into the endosomes located within the cell.
The process of insertion also requires the presence of the S protein via the release of the TMPRSS2 protein in the host, an inhibition that is under investigation as a potential treatment. This activity has led some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help in the fight against infection.

A systematic review and analysis study published on 11 July 2012 found that use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to non-users.
However, the risk of pneumonia is reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have previously faced a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly patients with cerebral hemorrhage and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been linked to a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the outcome is less pronounced than the risk of pneumonia as a whole.
ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a highly potent treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and it promotes improved circulation of blood in the lungs as well as lipopolysaccharide-linked oxygenation, which causes severe respiratory complications.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, and the onset of activity is 30 minutes over the 24-hour effective duration.

The vaccine that is being developed will not be safe or effective.
Recent studies of vaccine efficacy in inhibiting COVID-19 on ACE2-transgenic animals such as turtles, other laboratory animals as well as non-human primates, all done for Level 3 biosecurity in viral management and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The SARS and MERS vaccines were tested in animal models, not humans.




The social media has revealed a conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been discovered and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents quoted from social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other coronaviruses such as SARS coronaviruses.

When these droplets are produced, they typically fall to the ground or surface rather than passing over a long distance.

Virus can survive outside for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after exposure, meaning that infection may occur before exposure or at different stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is real-time transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) viral counts taken from nasal and ventricular samples.

In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, tissue damage, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
COVID-19 symptoms after infection should last five to six days, but it can also develop symptoms between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. The report shows that not all people who develop symptoms do.

The proportion of people infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infections remain asymptomatic during hospital stays.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily case list on April 1, out of 166 infections that day, with 130 (78%) asymptomatic cases when tested.
Both stool and saliva can carry a lot of virus.

A study in Singapore found that uninterrupted coughing can cause a waterfall to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).

Certain forms of treatment such as ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the outer airway to be blocked, thus causing airborne transmission.

The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) has noted that while it is not clear how easily the disease spreads, it is generally possible for one person to transmit from two to three others. The virus can survive for days to hours on a surface.
The virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on cardboard, for up to four hours on plastic (polypropylene) and alloy steel (AISI 304), and for up to 99 percent on tires.

Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Soap products damage the virus's immune system, disabling it, as well as cleaning it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antibiotic) were less effective. In a Hong Kong study, oral urine samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospital admission.

SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the severe respiratory syndrome of the novel coronavirus, which was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with a cluster of severe respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 occur in viruses related to the coronavirus.

The liver is the organ most affected by COVID-19 as the virus enters the host cell via the enzyme ACE2 receptor, which is secreted by the lungs' second type of small airway cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and insert the host cell".

The incidence of cardiovascular syndrome is high due to the inflammatory response of the system and the problems of the immune system during the course of the disease, but damage to the cardiovascular system can also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High rates of hepatic vascular blockade (31%) and venous thrombosis (25%) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor prognosis.Celloplasty on people who died from COVID-19 found alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-carrying swelling in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 requires the ACE2 enzyme present on the cells of the gastrointestinal tract, patients with severe COVID-19 disease have symptoms similar to that of a full-blown rash.
In particular, the GM-CSF pathogen released T cells that have been shown to be involved in inflammation as they are associated with IL-6 release from monocytes and severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
The lymphocyte penetration has also been reported to be elevated.
The World Health Organization has announced several ways to detect viruses.
The standard method of testing is real-time polymerase chain reaction (rT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on a sample from the respiratory tract that is received by the nose. However, a nasal sample or a nasal sample may also be used.

Some physicians prefer to stick with a mechanical ventilation system that is pathogenic when possible because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow cannula nasal spray. Severe cases are more common in older people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries lack adequate hospitals, limiting the capacity of health systems to deal with the sudden rise in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring adequate hospital care.

A ventilator capable of regulating shape, pressure and high PEEP is needed to maximize oxygen supply while reducing the risk of lung injury and pulmonary pneumonia.
High-quality PEEPs may not be available on older free-air machines.

Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral, seems to be the most successful.

Antiviral drugs can be tested in people who are seriously ill.
The World Health Organization has recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of the treatment. The FDA has provisionally authorized treatment using your own blood serum as a trial treatment in some cases where patients face serious and even fatal outcomes.

Tis believed that these cases are a progression of long-term infection rather than a relapse.
The virus is thought to be of natural origin and originated from animals via transmission.

The study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19 infection, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, indicated the first day of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.


These numbers vary regionally and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.


Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who died from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who died from the disease.
These statistics are timeless and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.

At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) had already died.

In the Netherlands, about 3% of blood donors are likely to have immune antibodies.
69 (0.004% of the population) are claimed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate was higher for men in studies done in China and Italy.
The risk is highest for men at age 50, with a male-female ratio of only 90%.

The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be responsible.
Differences in the sexual immune system, decreasing prevalence of smoking in women, and men having similarly evolved conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women all may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are male, and 72% of those who die from COVID-19 are male.

Studies have shown that viral infections such as Ebola, Hiv, Tuberculosis and SARS affect men and women differently.

The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is COVID-19.
World Health Organization President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified, which was 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to any particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or human groupings, in accordance with international guidelines for naming, which aim to prevent transmission. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as provisional names for viruses and diseases, in line with the recommendations against use in the 2015 Disease and Virus Names Index.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.

In one example, when an Italian hospital needed emergency ventilation and the supplier couldn't deliver on time, that new local company reverse engineered the product and produced the 100 needed ventilation overnight.

Previous studies on SARS-CoV are to be reused as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can enter human cells via ACE2 receptor cells.
There have been three strategic vaccine trials.
Researchers first aim to create a fully feasible vaccine.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether it is inactive or dead, is to trigger a response of the human body's immune system to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that stimulate the immune system to certain parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2+, such research focused on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technology for vaccine creation).

Improvements in the disease status have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat cancer, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.



On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an Open Notice authorizing the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine drugs in accordance with the physician's decision to treat patients with COVID-19. China's 7th Directive also authorizes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high levels of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials.
Nitazoxanide was suggested for further study after it was found to have low inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies have shown that there is a release of the protein via the serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) receptor, which is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate cells via ACE2 receptor cells.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for use with or without azithromycin is controversial, as there is a defense from the medical community that these treatments should be used without study. Oseltamivir does not stop SARS-CoV-2 and has no role in the treatment of COVID-19.
This cytokine surge may be a consequence of the late stage of COVID-19 severity.

The drug, interleukin-6, was approved by the FDA based on a follow-up case study for the treatment of various causes of stress-induced steroid refractory cytokine therapy with CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of antibodies that have been isolated and collected produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to people who need it is being observed as a method of non-vaccination immunization.

Vaccination is the mechanism of action that is anticipated by treatment with activated antibodies to mediate immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody- and/or phagocytosis-dependent cytokines.
For example, other forms of inorganic therapeutics using synthetic clonal antibodies are in development.
The serum for recoveries that has the blood of the recoveries contained a specific antibody to the same virus that was being developed.
