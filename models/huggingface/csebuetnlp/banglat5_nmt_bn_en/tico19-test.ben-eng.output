The European Union/European Economic Region and the United Kingdom have seen a rapid increase in cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) from January 1 to March 15, 2020
The increasing number of cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show a similar trend between the European Union/European Economic Zone countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that, depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is fast approaching in all countries.
Based on the knowledge available from Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase preparation for the rapid growth of COVID-19 patients who need health care and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a swarm of pneumonia with unknown diagnosis theory was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the Novel COVID-19 as an effective component is now being referred to as serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Hence, the illness resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection was named COVID-19.
To this day, evidence suggests that 80% of those infected with COVID-19 have mild disease, that is, respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
Among 14% of those infected, COVID-19 becomes more serious disease that calls for hospitalization, while 6% of those infected experience serious illness that requires intensive care.
The death rate of patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we review the trend of a series of COVID-19 cases in each European Union/European Economic Regional (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with Hubei province in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in Italy between January 31-March 15, 2020, with the current number of EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom.
EU/EEA COVID-19 incidents in countries and UK
COVID-19 spread more geographically behind China, and the dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world is now followed by this country.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Euroservice, Spitary and his associates reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases among those returning from Wuhan in Hubei province of China were reported by France on 24 January 2020.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported since December 31, 2019, while Italy alone has reported 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Getting the increasing number and increasing scale of COVID-19 infected
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only reports COVID-19 cases counted in each country worldwide from government sources such as the Ministry of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities, and WHO, which is updated at 8:00 a.m. daily.
These data were used to evaluate the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the briefly increasing incidents of COVID-19 in 14 days, thus considering the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom during the period of 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also presented the sequence of cases documented in each country until 8:00 am on March 15, 2020, and compared them to cases in Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
EU/EEA Trends of COVID-19 in countries and UK
In the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, the trend of the 14-day brief increase of COVID-19 was generally followed by Hubei Province (China) (fig. 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom overall, the increasing case of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then sharply increased (complementary factors) around February 28, 2020.
This was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown a similar increase in the increase of COVID-19 increase (complementary materials).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of Italy's numbers with the series of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period of 31 January 15 March 2020.
It is noteworthy that until 8:00 am on March 15, other 15 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom already reported the comparable total infection in Italy in 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The increasing trend in cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is progressing at a relative pace in all countries.
It must be examined in order to confirm COVID-19, including catch-up testing, despite the differences in countries, the national public health responses, and the possibility of different definitions of infected people and different protocols for patient choices.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care, and media sources suggest that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
COVID-19 admissions to hospitals and/or an intensive care unit are currently available only in 6% and 1% of cases at the EU/EEA level (the data is not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to fill the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths reported.
A survey conducted in 2010 11 showed a major difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe in the format of 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 lacs in Portugal.
This means that countries may have less or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 201011).
In accordance with the extent of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, the modelling situation regarding healthcare capacity involvement has shown that there is a > 90% risk of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds and is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's quick risk evaluation of COVID-19.
Since cases are still clustered in EU/EEA countries and in several regions of the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally provide to people using a particular regional service, therefore, information about infected and intensive care beds should be available in the method of regional unit naming for level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the country, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the ongoing community infection situation of SARS-CoV-2 and to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need health care and especially intensive care, as happened in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk evaluation, a rapid, pre-active and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection is essential, with changes in the methods of suppression to mitigation, since unless implemented earlier, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not take sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their reaction
Quick risk evaluation also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the epidemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity in which countries are likely to increase their control efforts to reduce the speed of SARS-CoV-2 spread and reduce the pressure on health care.
Failure to do this, there is a possibility that health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients needing intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused 3,000 deaths and over 80,000 infections in China and the rest of the world, bringing a catastrophe on mankind.
SARS-CoV is similar to its symbolic virus, which caused SARS in several thousand people in 2003, while SARS-CoV-2 can also be infected from bats and can cause similar symptoms through the same method.
However, the intensity and deaths of COVID-19 are lower than SARS but are much more infectious and infest older people than younger people and more men than women.
In response to many rapidly increasing publications about diseases, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research issue.
We will include primary issues regarding epidemiology, ethics, virology, diagnosis, treatment, speed indicators of disease and prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help us understand and eradicate the panic disease.
The spring festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were asked to stay indoors for the entire holiday and for many weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
The virus is highly sympathized with the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the severe intense respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and its related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and over 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been released and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and is probably more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/published/) less than two months since its first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virus, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis and treatment, determining the sequence of viruses separated from multiple patients.
The review attempts to summarize the progress of research on new and fast-growing issues.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-generated disease, respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS, Mahamari in 2012).
We have discussed so far what we have learned about the prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some remaining yet urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered to be non-deadly pathogens in humans, making up about 15% of the 4 common colds.
Of course, in this century, we have faced two highly disease-causing bacterial human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which began a epidemic outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible symptoms and mortality rates.
Hence, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in figure 1,1, the clusters of pneumonia that were unknown were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
The sequence of CoV was released seven days later.
The first deadly case in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were informed of the infection, which indicated that human-to-human infection was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was locked down and all public transportation was shut down.
The first diagnostic study on the disease on January 24 suggested that only 21 of the 41 confirmed patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the source of the infection initiated by an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a worldwide health emergency.
As of this report, the disease has already spread to China and around 50 other countries around the world (fig. 2).
As the situation has grown rapidly, the final degree and intensity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the pandemic ( https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_RHPXa1qH2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but it is mainly found in the age group 30-65.
About half of the infected (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from its introduction to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the start of the disease to the death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary breeding number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before January 23, 2020, in line with the mass transportation period before China's Spring festival.
The mortality rate in the confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the combined mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a suborder of large and packed viruses containing a single formula of Sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta coVs are known to infect humans.
S for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, glycoprotein is tied to its cellular customer Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptideal peptides 4 (DPP4) and then the membrane is added.
The viral RNA is released in the cytoplasm; after replicating the viral genome, the envelop forms a genetic RNA virion-containing vaccine with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then mix with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genemic case of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of Beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity out of 10 sequence samples collected from the Huanan Marine Food Market in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV has much more genetic similarity with MES-CoV than SARS-CoV-2.
Through transmission electron microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the subtle part of the human respiratory epithelium.
It was discovered that human ACE2 was a receptor in the case of SARS-CoV-2 along with human SARS-CoV-2.
However, SARS-CoV-2's S proteins are relatively weakly tied to human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, which is coincidental to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms an unique small protein encoded by orf3b and can also create proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orph3b may play a role in the ability to cause viral disease and prevent the release of IFN; however, orf8 does not have a known verbal field or style.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryo-EM structure of full length human ACE2 with 2.9  resolution in mixed components including amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the open and closed adaptation mixture was combined as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could lock two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of CoV.
To reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic goal for drug testing.
root and intermediate host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread to the human body through civet cats and camels respectively.
By comparing a filegenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the bat was considered a natural host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% equivalent to two SARS-like CoVs from Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus overcome the species' barrier to infect humans is still unknown and the infection path remains to be explained in detail.
Ji and others presented the snake as the carrier of the virus from bats to humans, which is associated with the homologous recombination of s proteins.
According to one survey, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that ant-eater mammals, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, were possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of genetic homology - 99% of the ant-eater mammals discovered in SARS-CoV-2 and CoV  in pangolins.
However, the 1% difference between the two genoms is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are still awaiting conclusive evidence (fig. 33).
The psycho-chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet fully known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment outside the organism and 5 days in temperatures less than 20 °C and less than 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar features.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to 56 °C for 30 minutes in ultraviolet and temperature; other fatty solvents, except ethanol, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing antibiotics, peracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine, can effectively disable the virus.
The entire human race typically lacks the immune system of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore have a risk of infecting the Novel virus.
No detailed study of the immune effect of SARS-CoV-2 is currently being conducted.
So, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
Usually, after a virus enters the host, it is first detected by the inherent immune system of the host through the pattern receptors. These receptors include C-type lactine receptor, Toll receptor (TLR), NOD receptor and RLR receptor (RIG-I).
Through various ways, the virus provokes expressions of inflammatory factors, maturity of the dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limits the infection of the virus and accelerates macrophase fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to avoid the immune system reaction.
Soon, suitable immune responses joined in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in prevention.
Cells of CD4+ T stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells kill directly virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytocain to help resistant cells.
However, CoV can prevent the activity of T cells by provoking the death of T cells.
Skin resistance, including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also necessary to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients resist MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive sensitivity to the immune system locally produces a large number of free radial that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in worst situations, multi-organic failure, even death, can occur.
SARS-CoV-2 infections characterized by flocks are more likely to cause damage to older people with previous disease and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are in contact with a large number of viruses or whose resistance is weak are more likely to be infected than others.
According to the study of the first 425 infected in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, studies of 1,099 cases have proved that the incubation period was an average of 3 days and spanned from 0 to 24 days.
A recent survey, according to the above description, showed that the generation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the population of 8,866 infected.
It is vital for health authorities to adjust the time of effective quarantine based on the most accurate morbidity of the virus, thus preventing the infection of the virus from infected but without symptoms to others.
As a common custom, individuals infected or in contact with the virus typically need to remain quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and primary symptoms of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, breath tension, muscles pain, drowsiness, headaches, throat pain, rhinoria, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
A week after the outbreak of the disease, some patients felt disponia and/or hypoxemia.
In serious cases, patients develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidism, and colopathy.
In cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, virus testing is necessary for primary diagnosis even if there is no pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic survey in late December 2019 found that out of the percentage of symptoms, 98% had fever, 76% had dry cough, 55% had dispensary and 3% had diarrhoea; 8% needed ventilation assistance.
Two recent studies of a class (family cluster) and a cluster (cluster) caused by infection from an unsymptomatic individual reported similar discoveries.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 found that the major symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and disponia (55%).
However, they needed 80% ventilation support, which is much higher than COVID-19 patients and is consistent with MERS' higher morbidity than COVID-19.
MERS patients also have diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
Among SARS patients it was proved that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dispensia (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and throat pain (13) -25%) were the main symptoms, and approximately 14%-20% patients needed ventilation assistance.
By February 14, the worldwide death rate of COVID-19 was 2% while confirmed infections reached 66,576.
In comparison, SARS death rate was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, a demographic survey in June 2012 found that the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier survey revealed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2, with 95% of the 5.71-7.23 confidence interval (CI), was as high as 6.47, while the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV is presented in table 1.1 in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and R0.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less deadly than the other two.
Therefore, controlling SARS-CoV-2 epidemics is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clustered infections often occur in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicles like sea vessels.
Often patients have a history of coming in contact with infected persons or patients in the last two weeks of traveling or living in Wuhan or other infected places or showing symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovered patients from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending a warning to extend quarantine.
In the initial stage, patients have normal or low range of marginal white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphocytes numbering <1×109/L, white blood cells numbering <4×109/L, and raised esperate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found. For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphocytes numbering <1×109/L, and rising esperate aminotransferase
Some patients had increased the levels of liver and muscles enzymes and muglobin in the blood, and most patients had increased the degradation of C-reactive proteins and erythrocytes in the blood.
In severely affected patients, D-dimer levels, a fibre-degrading product in the blood - increased and the number of lymphocytes declined.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormality in chest radiography and are characterized by bilateral irregular shadow or rubbed glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience symptomatic pneumonia, acute lung injuries, and acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid fermentation, and progressive phibrosis seriously endanger gas exchange.
The abnormal activity of Type I and Type II numocytes decreases the surface tension and increases the surface tension, thereby reducing the lungs' ability to expand and increase the risk of weakening.
Thus, the worst types of chest radiographic searches are often found in the most serious spread of the disease.
On February 18,2020, the pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the dissociation of the nemocyte serum, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the interstitial lymphocyte inflection, and multinucleated syncytic cells in the lungs of the viral infection and ARDS pathology, similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification through Reverse-Transcribing Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for COVID-19 detection.
However, due to extremely high wrong-negative rates, which could accelerate the pandemic, on February 13, 2020, in China, clinical revelations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR).
The situation has been similar with diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the connection between the history of the disease, diagnostic display, laboratory tests and radiological investigations is essential and necessary to determine effective disease.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHERLOCK) technique to determine SARS-CoV-2, which determines the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter per microliter 10-100 copies per input)
It is hoped that the new strategy can dramatically increase sensitivity and accessibility if the diagnostic sample is verified.
Because of the lack of experience in the Novel CoV, doctors can provide mainly assistive care to COVID-19 patients while trying to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus-related diseases (table 2).
The therapy includes antiviral drugs, immune response suppression, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese drugs and mental assistance in current and possible treatments.
Even plasmas were offered for treatment from recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs initially, and is probably less likely to attack other organs that reveal ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidney.
Nevertheless, respiratory failures and disabilities are the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to alleviate symptoms and saves lives, including common oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-cut ventilation, and mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with serious respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopalmonary bypass technology that is used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failures.
It is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent and treat indirect infection and septic shock, and protect the functioning of important organs.
It has been reported that cytocine disease results from excessive immune system reactions in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytocine disaster is a form of inflammatory reactions to the system, presented by the release of cytocine classes including TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN, IFN, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokins cause immune cells to emit large numbers of free radical emissions, major causes of ARDS and multiple organ failures.
Resistance response is essential in treatment of cytocine disease, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilizumabs, a anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytocine disease.
Other immune responses for cytocine disasters include correction of T cell-directed immune response; blocking IFN-, IL-1, and TNF; reduction of JAK; reduction of blynatumobab; reduction of cytocine signaling 4; and  HDAC reduction.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used in the treatment of SARS as immunosuppressants.
However, high medication levels of steroids were not beneficial for serious lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the possibility of arrest.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate medication are recommended to be used discreetly for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intercellular application, including remdesivir, nucleotide analogs, has proved effective for a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remediesivir is a novel antiviral drug that was initially developed by Gilead to treat the diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, Remdecivir also showed possible resistance to other single formula RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound to China for a pair of trials on infected people with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms have been recommended as baricitinb (baricitinb), interferon-, Lopenavir/Ritonavir and rebavirin.
After combined therapy with Lopenavir/Ritonavir, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of liver, and other adverse reactions may occur.
The interactions of this treatment with other drugs used in patients should be carefully observed.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
There has been a long history of collecting blood from infectious patients to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy ones from getting infected.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood in terms of pathogens.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight bacteria and other external objects, and they detect distinct molecules of pathogens and directly mitigate them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduction in inflammation and viral load and improvement in blood oxygen contact.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed, and before that, verification and clarification are needed to propose methods for large-scale use.
Furthermore, in view of the medical effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytocine release syndrome, a possibly life-threatening toxicity.
The blood density of antibodies is generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies at certain stages to fight global pandemics.
Hence, it is more important and effective to separate B cells from recovered patients and to monitor effective antibodies against the proteins required by the virus or to identify genetic codes to encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years for treatment of various diseases.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of multiple components in a formula which varies depending on the diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most effective elements are unknown or vague, since such elements or their favorable combination are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become a major alternative treatment for patients with mild to medium symptoms or patients who have returned from serious conditions.
For example, it was reported that Shu Feng Xi Du (Shu Feng Xi Du) capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) capsules were effective in treating COVID-19.
In many Chinese states where TCM was used for COVID-19 patients, the highest rate of recovery was found in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei, where TCM was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the lowest (13%) was in Hubei.
However, this is a quite gross comparison because many other influential factors, such as the number and intensity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a survey comparing WM and TCM combined treatment with Western medicine (WM).
They found that the time required for body temperature restoration, symptoms removal, and hospitalization was significantly shorter in WM+TCM groups than in WM groups alone.
Most attractively, the symptomatic deterioration rate (from light to severe) was significantly lower than the WM+TCM team (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the death rate was lower than the WM+TCM team (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM's effectiveness and security awaits greater levels and more well-controlled testing at more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the process of operation and, if possible, make clear the effective ingredients or combinations of TCM treatment.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel extremely extremely infectious and even deadly, and those in quarantine also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough, and the adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to further anxiety and emotional stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, a variety of psychiatric symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attack, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, compulsory contact tracking and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt about the effects of infection, quarantine, and the malignment of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental healthcare should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, and individuals in contact with them as well as people in general who need it.
Psychological assistance includes forming mental health teams from multiple branches of medical science, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid intimate contact with one another.
Effective vaccines are necessary to block the chain of infection from animal reservoirs and infected humans to sensitive hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment to control epidemics caused by revealing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and strong resistant antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or produce protective immunity.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
However, before beginning a medical study, the effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in the organisms and the deadly-change model in the elderly humans and their protection against virus transmission from animals to humans has not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was destroyed 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, scattered incidents and MERS swarms continued to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the existence of junotic sources in the diseased region.
Vaccination techniques for MERS have been prepared using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Preparing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the long-term requirement for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic changes in the CoVs.
As a novel disease, the complete diagnostic course of COVID-19 has just begun to be fully developed for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without previous illness.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a higher illness and death rate in cases of serious infections.
Therefore, it is essential for health care agencies to develop a prediction model for prioritizing their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on yet-known diagnostic studies, the following factors may or may be involved in diagnosing the pace of COVID-19 patients (table (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the outcome of SARS, as is true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mainly in 30-65 years of age, including 47.7% of patients over 50, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have other diseases and complications at the same time, and were significantly older than others (mid-age 66 vs. mid-age 51), indicating age as a speed of disease for the consequences of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: Men have more SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Multiple Diseases and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need profound care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arthritis.
Cardiac incidents were also the main cause of death of SARS patients.
It has also been reported that ACE2-positive colangiocyte can also be connected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in cOVID-19 patients' liver failure.
It must be remembered that age and inherent disease are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Unusual data found in the laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the inflammation or intensity of tissue injury and have been suggested as a factor indicating the potential pace of disease, therapy response, and final recovery.
The correlation between the CRP level and the intensity and forecast of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspirate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and cretin cinease (CK) can also help predict consequences.
These enzymes are extensively expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and emitted during damage to tissue tissue.
Thus, they are traditional diagnostics for heart failure or liver failure.
Major diagnostic symptoms: To predict the complexity and consequences of COVID-19, chest radiography and progress during diagnostic symptoms should be considered together with other problems.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used as immunosuppressants for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high drug levels of corticosteroids were widely used among serious SARS patients, many residents were suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with long-term disability and low living standards.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used for low doses and short periods in case of COVID-19 patients.
Emotional Stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients often experienced unusual emotional stress as they endured long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and saw their family members and fellow patients face death.
Psychological counsel and long-term assistance are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies till now, the epidemical characteristics of COVID-19 seem to differ from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower part of the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper part of the respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms during the early stages of the infection, similar to other CoVs responsible for common cold.
Hence, it is very difficult to control the epidemic that patients infected in the early stages or during the emergence of the virus can produce large quantities of viruses during daily work.
However, SARS-CoV infection was considered to occur when patients became seriously ill, when most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe than the outbreak of SARS and is difficult to control.
China is currently under great efforts, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities in hopes of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population.
Although these measures have dramatically affected the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowing down of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the phase of depression will continue for 3-4 months.
Other experts, however, are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others speculated that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to forecast the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the worldwide population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-terbine and throat saliva, indicating that the newly detected virus would become a cyclical phase similar to the influenza.
However, there are optimistic indications in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may have worked.
Earlier it was predicted that Ebola would cause one million infections, with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in infection and eventually destroy or become a less infectious virus in human contact.
The following is a comparison of SARS and MERS to the COVID-19 pandemic (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectable through coughing or sneezing and perhaps direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the male, highlighting new possibilities of rectum-to-mouth infection.
A recent study of 138 infected people suggested that 41% of the cases were probably caused by nosocomial infection, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, adequate precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those near the patient or infected person.
The use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860s) can help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small drops of liquid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or stuck to the surface of the object, from where they could spread to others.
However, only N95 (Series #1860s) masks can protect from breathing smaller virons as small as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% virons are able to fully enter; SARS-CoV-2 is the size of SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can enter even five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series #1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
To further reduce contact with the virus, health care providers should wear a suitable infection gown, besides masks.
The virus can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Hence, healthcare providers should also wear transparent mouth cover or goggles when patients work.
In the case of the public in affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands more frequently with antibiotics soap, try to stay indoors to quarantine himself, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet of humans are considered appropriate to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective for reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus in the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, China should have taken high alert on the basis of deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan's Disease Control Center comforted the citizens by telling them that the Novel virus is less contagious and that the human-to-human reproductivity is limited and that there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
This message significantly relaxed public fears, especially when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival and wasted important times in controlling the disease at a minimum level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agency can take this harsh lesson and make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should take more care when making public announcements because each word will be considered by citizens and it can change their attitude and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to undesirable information received from clinics without waiting for formal reports by doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive to prevent possible epidemics at the initial stage rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4)
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, began in late December 2019.
Within less than two months, it spread throughout China, and at the time of writing this report, it has spread to more than 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and has similarity between COVID-19 and SARS symptoms, the outbreak of COVID-19  has created a sense of return to SARS.
However, there are some striking differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary to prevent epidemics and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than younger people and men than women, and intensity and mortality rates are higher than younger people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (1.44% compared to 10.91%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are unsymptomatic, whereas SARS patients usually do so when they are seriously ill, making it much more difficult to prevent COVID-19 infection than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more quickly and larger than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive to the virus.
These discoveries dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
In view of such rapid progress in research in COVID-19, several important issues remain to be solved:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of SARS-CoV-2 and two Bats SARS-Near CoV have been found, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal was the middle species to transmit the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the spread of infection and the outbreak may return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is tied to ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter the respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also block ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to that question, we cannot get quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically magnifying during human infection?
Will it become a global epidemic, a death like SARS, or a recurrent outbreak like the flu?
This is essential, but it takes some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the price it demands, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic and restore our lives to normal as soon as possible.
Animal sources of human coronaviruses
Transformation and adaptation have led to co-evolution of co-hosts, including the coronavirus (CoV) and mankind, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known as causes of light illnesses such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin to show how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back to the top of the discussion and surprised us by its high infection capacity and less diseases compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-borne disease, and understanding the junotic source of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are less diseased.
Some HCoVs have also been detected as a middle reservoir shelter.
The host detection of animals has a direct impact on human disease prevention.
Investigating the coV-housing interactions between animals can also provide important insights on CoV disease in humans.
In this review, we give a brief description of the existing knowledge of the seven HCoVs, based on the history of their discoveries as well as their animal sources and interrelated infections.
Importantly, we compare and compare various HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and GNOME reconnection.
In this context, the current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been discussed.
Furthermore, the need for successful shelter changes and the effects of virus evolution in the severity of disease are also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family Coronavirides, containing a group of covered, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses, which shelter the largest genome of RNA viruses from 26 to 32 kilobes, were called "CoV" because of their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope."
Structurally, CoVs have integral genomes that form the same organization.
About two thirds of the GNOME contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replications polyproteins.
Polyproteins are also processed to produce 16 other non-structural proteins, which have been named nsp1~16.
The rest of the GNOME contains ORF for formative proteins, which include s, packages (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some lines-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV, and Delta-CoV), of which Beta-CoV contains most of HCoV and is divided into four families (A, B, C and D).
Racial evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as gene sources for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continued to overcome interspecies barriers and have emerged as some of the major human diseases.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been known.
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five Beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause light symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly detected SARS-CoV-2 cause acute lower respiratory infection in relatively more patients with higher probability of excessive respiratory disease symptoms (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome, ARDS) and higher probability of exposure outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from nose discharge in patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, further knowledge has been gathered through extensive study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, the idea was widely accepted that infection of HCoVs is generally innocent.
The 2003 outbreak of SARS was one of the most devastating events in recent history, affecting 8,000 people and a crude death rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to the epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically throughout the rest of the world.
The 2019 Novel HCoV (2019-NCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the active agent of the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting in more than 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 infections as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world has to prepare for the impending pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal origins from bats, rodents or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and non-immune but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
The search for animal sources of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the causes of natural history, driving forces, and the limitations of species to species jumping.
In addition to important issues involved in preventing future spilovers, it can guide or guide the search for reservoirs, intermediate and magnifying animal shelter(s) of SARS-CoV-2.
In this review, we present a summary of the animal sources, inter-species infection and disease.
In particular, we want to highlight this general context and discuss that the guardian viruses of HCoVs are usually disease-causing in their natural reservoir shelters but are disease-causing after entering the new reservoir shelters.
We also review the evolutionary trend of HCoV, where the disease often decreases as infectionability increases.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this context.
The CoVs of animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoVs were collected from various infected animals including turkeys, rodents, cows, pigs, cats and dogs before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first collected from nasal discharge in general cold patients.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been detected.
A summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract in 1966 in patients with upper respiratory infection and later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Infected patients with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, feeling illness, and throat pain, while 10~20% had fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from organ culture and subsequent repetitive growth of the virus in the brain of suckling rats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomatically distinguished from infection of other respiratory pathogens such as Influenza A virus and Rhinoceros.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widely distributed and are mainly infected in winter climates during temperate seasons.
Usually, the initial stage of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A study by human volunteers found that healthy people with HCoV-229E developed light common cold.
Only some patients with immunity disability had serious low respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "Atipical Pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV-related epidemic in human history, and its causal representative was SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS was found in late 2002 in Guangdong, China.
The SARS pandemic has resulted in 8,096 cases reported across many countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to super-sprayers, it was estimated that each case could increase about two accompanying cases, along with the final symptoms of viral load as soon as it appears on the 10th day of the illness.
SARS-CoV patients primarily have muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort, and suffocation after cold, coughing and respiratory pain as delayed symptoms.
Lymphopinia, testing distorted liver functions, and increased cretain chinease are typical laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
SARS patients also have dispersed alveolar damage, spread of subcellular cells, and macrophases.
About 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, and the kidney, can also be infected in serious cases, usually with cytocine disorders that can be especially fatal to patients with immune system failure.
The virus was first collected from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an indicator patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was collected in late 2004 from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands.
It was primarily prevalent among young children, elderly and respiratory ill patients with low immunity.
Common disease caused by HCoV-NL63 in coriza, eyebrows, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy who suffered from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widely distributed.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of general respiratory diseases and is the most common case in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-raised pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma.
HCoV-HKU1, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, has been found worldwide, causing respiratory mild diseases.
All of these four group-raised HCoVs are well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to be transformed to cause high pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown reasons, such as the rare case of HCoV-NL63 with a highly harmful sub-type that has recently been reported to have caused severe respiratory infection in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to infect and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they become less harmful or infectious.
MERS-CoV was first collected in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and secretion failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases from outside have been reported from various European countries and Tunisia, sometimes with secondary spread in close contacts.
In 2015, South Korea experienced another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases.
Diagnosed with progressive acute pneumonia, diagnostic expressions of MERS are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also had acute renal failure, unique to HCoV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of abdominal diseases such as diarrhoea and nausea.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories have confirmed that more than 34.4% of death rate cases have occurred, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses in humans.
From mid to late December 2019, the classes of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, as related to the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, with a rate of approximately 3.4% deaths, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
Significantly, the death toll in Hubei in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, coughing, and respiratory conditions.
Some patients also develop diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress quickly to acute respiratory crisis syndrome.
Although 82% of the high nucleotide sequences are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to homeology, they cluster in different branches of the racial tree.
SARS-CoV-2 seems to be less infectious but is more infective than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has reported uninfected cases and may play a role in its rapid spread around the world.
SARS-CoV-2 is very interesting in comparison and comparison with six other HCoVs.
First of all, the incubation time and the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of six other HCoVs.
Second, the intensity of the symptoms of COVID-19 occurs between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection displays characteristics that are commonly seen during the infection of HCoVs acquired by the community with non-specific, light or even non-symptomatic presentations.
On the other hand, a small portion of serious cases of COVID-19 also show symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection group shows interesting characteristics of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has at least the same infectiousness as that of group-adopted HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is yet to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in mall samples.
Future studies are yet to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in cases like SARS-CoV in at least some situations.
It is particularly interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 displays seasonal dependence, as has been demonstrated by community-raised HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its infectionability, disease, and sustainable spread after transition to humans, will be dominant in the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four mild-symptomatic groups - all of which have achieved HCoV - are well adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can respond to ancient HCoV epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious disease in humans and those who develop serious HCoV disease have been killed.
To do this, HCoVs must produce adequate amounts of copies in humans to freeze adaptive mutations that fight the causes of shelter restrictions.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the more people infected it, the more likely it will be to adjust completely to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its infection in the human body by quarantine or other measures of infection control.
Over the years, four group-gathered CoVs have been spreading to human populations, and have been causing common cold in patients with general resistance.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly disease-causing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and cannot continue to be infected.
They need to be maintained and extended in junotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread through one or more intermediate and modified hosts to capable human targets.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-gathered HCoV.
At least until now, it is as highly infectable as the community-gathered HCoV.
However, it is more disease-causing than group-raised HCoVs and less disease-causing than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It has to be seen whether it is fully adapted to humans and spread to humans without any reservoir or intermediate host.
Before discussing the origin of the animals of HCoVs, we can benefit from discussing the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and modification shelter of HCoVs.
An animal serves as a evolutionary host of HCoV if it shares higher homology at the level of nucleotide sequences to shelter closely related ancestors.
The ancestral virus is generally well adapted to this shelter and is non-immune.
Similarly, a container shelter gives HCoV shelter continuously and long-termly.
In both cases, shelters are naturally infected and they are the natural shelters of HCoV or its guardian virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is newly acquainted with an intermediate shelter before or around humans, it does not fit well with the new shelter and is often disease-causing.
This intermediate shelter can act as an animal source of human infection and can play an enhanced shelter in temporarily replicating the virus and then broadening the level of human infection through human infection.
If HCoV does not keep the infection in the middle shelter, the infection may be stopped.
In contrast, HCoVs can also be adapted to the intermediate host and can begin a long-term incidence.
In this case, the middle host becomes the host of the natural reservoir.
Epidemiology data revealed in a series of incidents that had a history of communication between hunting animals and the index case of SARS.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG was higher among animal traders than in general public.
A raccoon dog was initially identified as carrying viruses like SARS-CoV in the markets of cockroaches (Paguma larvata) and living animals.
This was alluded to by the fact that no other case of SARS was known after all the cobras were killed in markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets in wild or farms without contact with the market of living animals were primarily negative to SARS CoV, suggesting that masked palm caterpillars would serve as only intermediate enhancing shelter but not as natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80% of different types of animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals can serve as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
These are all considered to be one-way hosts of SARS-CoV.
The next investigation of the natural host of SARS-CoV  revealed a closely related Bat CoV, called the SARS-related Rh-BatCoV HKU3 (SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshoe bat. The next investigation revealed a closely related Bat CoV, called the SARS-related Rh-Batcov H
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for HKU3's genome sequence.
These and other Bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequences with Homeology SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the idea that bats provide shelter for emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs (SL-CoVs) like SARS have been detected from bats, but none can be collected as a living virus except one designated WIV1.
Human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a subscriber of SARS-CoV .
WIV1 was demonstrated for using bat, civet, and human ACE2 as receptors to enter cells from bats' excrement samples.
Interestingly, serums of SARS infected patients were able to disable WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence of homeology.
Although the two viruses have high levels of homology, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not an immediate parental virus and that bats are not the immediate reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
Filegenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV into the same category as Bat CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat uses the same host receptor, Deeppotidil Peptides 4 (DPP4), to access CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses.
RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically close to counterparts of Bat Beta-CoVs detected from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative Bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequences in homeology.
Hence, bats may not be the immediate reservoirs of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that single-headed camels are ceropositive for certain antibodies for MERS-CoV, similar to those of Middle Eastern origin in multiple African countries.
MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was obtained from the nose swab of a humped camel, which also indicates that the camel acts as a host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that the camels experimentally infected by MERS-CoV usually have light symptoms, but there have been a lot of virus shading.
Significantly, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory system but also through the rectal-oral route, which is also the main route to spread the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed infections of MERS had no history of contact with camels before the symptoms began, perhaps involving human-to-human infection or infection routes involving an unknown species that shelter MERS-CoV.
Bat CoV RatG13, collected from the Rhinoceros Afinis bats, has 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence diversion between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also very high to determine parental relationships.
This means that if the nearly identical Bat CoV is not available in the future, the bats may not be host(s) of SARS-CoV-2's direct reservoir.
Perhaps, the animal shelter of SARS-CoV-2, Huanan seafood, should be sold and killed in the wholesale market, with many early cases of COVID-19 related, indicating a possible animal-to-human infection incident.
Several recent studies based on metagonological sequences suggest that a group of endangered small mammals known as the Bonroe (Manis Javanica) can also carry paternal Beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel bornrooves represent 85-92% nucleotide sequences of the CoV genomes in homeology SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally associated with RaTG13 with about 90% uniformity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They cluster into two sub-sequences of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in the racial tree, one of which divides the same receptor binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2.
On the contrary, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 are further deviated, although the sequence of homology is a genenomic-broad higher degree.
An earlier study on sick bornrooves also indicated a continuous sequence of virus detection from lung samples, which has been proved to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to create a partial genome sequence with approximately 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot deny the possibility that Pangolin is one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no current evidence to support the direct source of SARS-CoV-2 as a result of the separation of the bita-CoV-2-related bita-coVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the Beta-CoV-related Bita-CoV-2.
The evolutionary course of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
Although the maximum sequence homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and the RBDs of the Bonroe, the Bita-CoV-related Vita-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 share the maximum genome-related sequence homology.
It is highly hypothetical that the high similarity between the beta-CoVs related to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a selection-mediated convergence evolution.
A counterproposal is in favor of the reconciliation between the third wild animal species, a bushroove, related to SARS-CoV-2-related Beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As a driving force in evolution, reconnections between beta-CoVs are widespread.
The direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not known.
In addition to highly diseased HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Filegenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from Bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that HCoV-NL63 has shown a close relationship with a bat cov, called ARCoV.2 (Apalachian Ridge Cov), detected in North American three-colored bat.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV called Hippocideros/Ghanakowam/19/2008, although comelids have been suspected to be the middle host of it.
For transparency, the current knowledge of the known animal sources of HCoVs has been shortened to table 1 and table 2.
The racial analysis has provided evidence of events in the inter-species sequence of CoVs in history.
A epidemic of respiratory disease appeared in the 1890s when HCoV-OC43 species transmitted humans from domestic animals beyond.
The interspecies infection history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats have been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an Alpaca-Alpha CoV.
Several evidence support the infection of the virus from bats to humans.
First, bats may have contact with humans in the shared ecological environment but not with alpacas.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpaker.
Secondly, alpha-CoVs of HCoV-229E-related bats are varied and non-immune to bats, while alpaca causes respiratory diseases in alpha-CoV-infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-coV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not undoubted that alpacas receive alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human disease-causing viruses, including Rebez virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, bats alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, but alpaca and one-cage camels can serve as intermediate shelter that transmits the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV served as an excellent example of transmission from a bat to a humped camel and from a humped camel to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was detected in the early detection and was further confirmed by subsequent research.
It is evident that bats provide a rich reservoir of virus species for genetic pieces and interspecial exchange of infections.
These are favorable conditions for the bat to be ideal 'virus spreaders'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, had been in contact with a humped camel decades ago.
It fit well with these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate shelter to a stable and natural shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very light diseases and maintains a relatively low transmission rate among these animals.
The sporadic infection in humans is an accident and humans remain the last shelter of MERS-CoV because the infection cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in the infection of MERS-CoV , the role of pangolins in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coVs are highly diseased among the pangolins.
In case of SARS-CoV, they may be the last shelter for bita-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to those of cobras.
Various possibilities of SARS-CoV-2's transmission from inter-species to humans may be included or rejected in future studies.
First, bats may be the shelter of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share environmental niches with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, the pangolins may be one of the intermediate magnifying shelters where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus was reintroduced.
Humans are infected by cutting and eating flesh of prey.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals for antibodies has been confirmed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in the third species that has links with both bats and pangolins.
Animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still under way.
In addition to various animal shelter providers, three major factors on the viral side are also important in helping CoVs overcome international barriers.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in the RNA counterpart.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered from "medium" to "high" depending on the coV adaptation phase of the Novel host, and the average replacement rate~10-4 replacement per site 2 per year."
CoVs have a proofreading oxyribonuclease, which removal results in extremely high variability and weakness or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, nucleotide analog remedyvs are known to form CoV replicas by reducing the exoraibonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdecivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 components tested in diagnostic trials.
Yet, the mutation rate of CoVs is about one million times higher than their shelter.
Furthermore, the transformation rate is often higher when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2's mutation rate is apparently lower, indicating a more easier adjustment to humans.
Perhaps it has already adapted to another shelter near man.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which fit well with a humped camel.
Theoretically, the possibility that SARS-CoV-2's genetic drift will quickly deactivate vaccines and antivirals is very low.
Secondly, the larger RNA of the CoV uses excessive flexibility in the genome mutations and reconnections, increasing the possibility of interrelated evolution, which is convenient for the rise of the CoVs when the situation becomes convenient.
It is supported by the open reading frame and protein functions, which are many unique encoded at the 3 end of the GNOME.
"Third, CoVs alter the templates when replicating RNA through random and often through a unique "replication-choice" process."
Strand sewing often occurs during coV RNA replication in shelter containers.
RNAs with higher homogeneous full lengths and subgenomes can reconnect to create new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural reconciliation has been found between HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and between animals CoVs such as Bat SL-CoV and Bat CoV-HKU9.
Infection-related virus-feeding interaction
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral exchange with the host receptor is another dominant factor in interspecies infection.
Meanwhile, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as an ideal example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecial infection.
According to a comparative analysis of the collection of humans and civets of SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoVs are believed to be fast adaptable to mutations in various refugees, especially S proteins in RBD.
RBD usually interacts with the cellular receptors in a CoV's S protein and is sharply selected by the response of the host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, the RBDT S1 piece contains 318th to 510th amino acids that are bound to its coryceptors for viral access along with human ACE2.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, civets, rodents, and raccoon dogs, which can cause interspecial infection of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid remnants have been found to be different from human and RBD viral isolates, and 4 of them are located in subscriber-bound designs to interact with ACE2 subscribers.
Civet SARS-CoV RBD contains mutations of K479N and S487T, which can increase the combination of spik proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be serious for human virus adaptation.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar cellular subscribers.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV's S1 units of S1 protein indicates that humans may change the tendency to bonding S protein with ACE2.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a trend of 10 to 20-fold higher bonds than that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine whether another co-respondent may be needed for the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Worryingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with separate parts of S.
There are many other HCoV subscribers, such as aminopoptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetilated salic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be the reason for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after they transmitted from their animal shelter to intraspecies.
In addition to the cellular receptors, the results of interspecial infection of HCoVs are also guided by factors of dependence and limitations on other shelter providers.
The division of these host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir shelters such as bats, a humped camel, and rats can prevent interspecies infection.
HCoVs must occupy the factors of shelter dependence for a successful interspecies infection and destroy the factors of shelter limitations.
In this case, molecular determinants are yet to be identified and characterized in this important area of virus-refugee transactions.
A neutral GNOME-wide screening of shelter dependence and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 can be effective using the sophisticated technology of CRISPR.
The rise of Novel HCoVs: Back to Where It Began
The variety of Bat CoVs provides sufficient opportunities for the rise of Novel HCoVs.
In this sense, Bat CoVs act as the gene pool of HCoVs.
Furthermore, rapid mutations and genetic reconnections drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the ability to severely correct viral phenotypes that are acquired or lost.
Among SARS-CoV-related proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adapting to humans because Bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were collected but they have been found to encode distinct ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion feature of SARS-CoVs was found in strands collected at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it seems to be an adaptive mutation that encourages change of shelter.
Also, there is a history of possible reconciliation of SARS-CoV with the family Alpha and Gamma CoVs, where a large number of smaller reconciliation zones were identified in RNA-based RNA polymers.
Reconsolidated locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10 and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV passed through the reconnection of various tribes, as in the case of a humped camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there have been cases of reconciliation in other HCoVs, where HCoVs reconciliate with other animal CoVs in their non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the viral genome, perhaps resulting in the release of viruses from selection pressures such as the host immune system.
Examples of these effects are the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to the removal of two-nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 HCoV-229E can be seen in bats and camel viruses, alpaca shows that alpha-CoV is placed inside a single nucleotide, resulting in frameshefts.
Last but important, the evolution of Novel HCoVs is also driven by the pressure to select their host host.
Bats were infected with CoVs when they were non-symptomatic or had only light symptoms detected, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It has been observed that bats fit well in origin and physiologically with CoVs.
For example, errors in activating responses to inflammation in bats efficiently reduce pathology driven by CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of the natural killer cells in the bats has been suppressed due to the low expression levels of the repressive natural killer cell receptors NKG2/CD94 and the major histocomputability complex I molecules.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from bats' high metabolic activity can do both to suppress CoV replications and to influence proofreading by xoraibonuclees, thus providing the pressure needed to produce virus strains when in contact with a new shelter.
Further diseasing CoV strains may also develop through resynthesis that leads to achieving neoprotein or protein character for shelter adaptation.
Thus, the possibility that three new HCoVs emerged in the last two decades is not coincidence.
CoVs cause mild symptoms in non-infectious or their container shelters, such as bats and camels.
They grow strongly without responding to the strong resistance of the shelter.
The secret is why symptomatic carriers appear and what causes serious human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of immune response and cytocine storm, where the stronger the response, the more severe the loss of the lungs.
In contrast, in cases of non-symptomatic carriers, the response to resistance has been separated from the CoV replication.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy with the same technique of disconnecting immune response can have beneficial effects.
Interferon reactions are particularly strong in bats.
Hence, the application of Type I interferon at least in the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the bats have NLRP3 inflammatory activation defects.
By this argument, the preventive of NLRP3 inflammazom with MCC950 can be effective in treating COVID-19.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general factors by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were raised.
On the one hand, a Bat Beta-CoV has been found that shares 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, and on the other hand, there is a Bat CoV that shares 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although cobras and other animals found in the market have been reported to have sheltered viruses similar to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate shelterers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
SARS-CoV-2 has occurred with strangely symmetrical beta-CoVs, suggesting that the beta-CoVs would serve as one of the intermediate shelters or that the beta-CoVs could contribute to the gene segment in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either deliberately or accidentally manufactured.
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has brought CoVs back to the focus of discussion.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the animal source of human infection and the importance of the animal reservoirs of HCoVs.
Extensive evidence has proved that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have a bats source and are transmitted to humans through intermediate shelter.
Since the SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and cobras in the market, closing the wet market and killing the cobras there could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same argument, in view of the discovery of multiple groups of pangolin beta coVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the pangolin should be removed from wet market to prevent animal infection.
However, what is at all and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the wild roosters and other mammals remains to be cleared in future investigations.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has long existed in camels with a hump.
Besides being important transport machines, these camels serve as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local people.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wild animals market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the repeated outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive method should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may occur.
Many types of animal CoVs are distributed in nature.
In particular, Bat CoVs with animal potential are very diverse.
These junotic CoVs have great potential for magnifying and reconnecting, eventually producing new CoVs that are more infectable and/or fatal in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary communication between humans and animals.
With the tests of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, there should be a better plan of preparation and response.
Many viruses have been on earth for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that are in favor of spreading viruses, the opportunity for humans to come in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware to stay away from them.
To understand better the ecology of CoVs and their natural shelter, continuous surveillance on mammals is needed, which will prove effective in preventing infection from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases in humans is to stay away from the environmental niches of animal viruses.
Several pieces of the animal source puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats infected the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 into the forest rooster, we need to see how bats and forest roosters can share the same environmental niche.
Second, if bat plays a more direct role in human infection, how humans come in contact with bat should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, it needs to be made clear how it interacts with various species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be done.
If it is Bat, Pangolin, or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical reproductive viruses will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continuing investigations in this area will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the standards for confirmed infections and confirmed infections of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick counsel guide for detection and treatment of the Novel COVID-19 (2019-NCoV) infection and this guide provided us with experience and provided good references for fighting this global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are also growing slowly based on ongoing research investigations and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment techniques are also being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment about our instructions and provided the very new diagnostic measures for suspected cases and assessed cases, according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment instructions issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named Civil Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a epidemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick counsel guide and published it online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
Since its release, it has received a huge response.
Remember, COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are also growing slowly based on ongoing research investigations and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment techniques are also being updated.
For example, the COVID-19-related diagnosis and medical instructions issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China ( http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have been released in a total of seven editions, each with significant changes in content.
Now Zhou and his companions have made a comment about our direction, proposing a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and also provided valuable references for the global pandemic.
We approve and thank them for their outstanding work.
Of course, their work must also be updated according to the latest diagnosis and medical instructions of COVID-19 (Trial VII) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspected cases, a detailed analysis must include two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical features, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, therefore three clinical symptoms must be filled.
Epidemiological history: (1) history of residents or traveling there, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms were revealed; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive in nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city or surrounding areas, or
Clinical revelations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of the COVID-19 infection; (3) Total White Blood Cell counts show normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte counts during the early appearance.
To determine a confirmed case based on suspected cases, there should be one of the following pathogenic or serogenetic evidence: (i) positive tests in the real-time PCR tests of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) high homogeneity or similarity with the novel coronavirus known in full gene sequences of the virus; (iii) positive IgM antibodies and IgG
We found that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions include real-time PCR tests and blood samples to test nucleic acid in the respiratory tract.
The disease detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the cerological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
Based on the continued work of researchers, these changes include respiratory samples, including blood samples, to search for a favorable nucleic acid detection kit for quick diagnosis, which increases the availability of different samples and helps bring certain antibodies positive results to confirmed standards.
Moreover, there is more evidence that reminds us to be careful about irregular symptoms and non-symptomatic patients.
Hence, the flow list of Zhou and his companions should be updated, as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as low risk.
The score system also needs to be verified in later clinical practices and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for comments.
To diagnose  and confirmed , we suggest identifying them and following the most recent instructions in their own countries.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to help.

On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Wolworths and Colls reduced the limit on purchasing toilet paper per transaction to two and one packages respectively in all stores at the national level.
Also, in Sembar, ALDI introduced a-pack line.
These restrictions were posted on checkouts and on chain's Facebook pages as messages.
Customers were reportedly stocking in fear of COVID-19, thinking that people would have to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limits sales of toilet paper for home delivery and packs a pack on each order.
These changes followed the limitations of four packs per transactions that Woolworths and Colls launched on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"On March 8, Coles reported to the media that the four-package ban has been introduced in various places, but "some shops still sell everything within an hour of supply," calling the demand "unexpected" and calling it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on ALDI on Tuesday."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales increased sharply last week.
Costelco's store in Canberra was also allowed for two packs last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles ordered larger packages than suppliers and increased the recurrence of supplies, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers tried to increase stock, but local council restrictions during distribution by trucks made it difficult.
As suppliers try to meet the demand, he expects production costs to increase.
ALDI announced Tuesday that after leaving the stock earlier, some shops could not conduct special sales on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said that shops fill up their stores every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy substance that keeps the collection low and that when all is sold, huge shelves are empty and strengthen the feeling of shortage.
According to ABC News, "Coles and Woolworths' opinion is that if he has plenty of things [which can be purchased], such as toilet rolls and sanitary, and there is enough, then the fear will probably be reduced," said Russell Zimmerman.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that their stocks would run out.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who makes cleanex toilet tissue and Solaris paper that produces sourants, emphasized that they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property vendors were offering free toilet papers to the first bidder at the Melbourne auction, some of which were auctioned because buyers had long weekends off on labor day.
This Thursday publication of NT News, daily printed in Darwin, provides an eight-page addition to pieces and is used as toilet paper.
According to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, shops were basically reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on their shopping.
Russell Zimmerman adds that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitary, dried products, handwash, and flour.
Similarly, every Sunday evening outside Australia, the online British supermarket Okado limited sales of paper used for Andres Toilet paper on two 12-roll packets.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 as a  epidemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
"Although the term "epidemic" does not mean how dangerous certain cases are but rather the widespread spread of any disease, the World Health Organization pointed out the need for governments to take action:
"""All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic.
"WHO Secretary General Adanom Ghebriasus said if the states can identify,"" can examine, treat, separate, identify and organize .
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of disease spread and intensity and the alarming level of inactivity."
According to Dr. Tom Fryden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), the global pandemic is "unprecedented".
"In a comment published on CNN in February, he said, "No other respiratory virus, except influenza, has been tracked from the period of continuous world spread."
"Gebresas shares the same opinion, saying, "We have never seen a COVID-19 pandemic before."
"He continued, "And we have never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a global epidemic follows WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health crisis of international concern.
"Dr. Anthony Fawcy, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The situation is going to get worse."
The Associated Press reported Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide is at least 126,000, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
This 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic is a pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which was declared a public health crisis of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been detected in 210 countries and union territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
The death rate in cases in China is estimated at 4%, while the global rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory disease syndrome.
The period from contact to initialization of symptoms usually lasts for five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and auxiliary therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your face while coughing, keeping a distance from other people, and monitoring and isolating people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have reacted by restricting travel control, quarantine, curfew, workplace risk control and facilities.
The global pandemic has resulted in severe global socio-economic disruptions, cancellations of sports, religious, political, and cultural events, and further supply shortages due to fear shopping.
Schools and universities are closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's total student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and cases of xenophobia and discrimination against other individuals from China, East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas where significant virus cases have been found.
Because of travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emission levels have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) in China reported a cluster of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was started in early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the Huanan seafood holcell market and therefore the virus is believed to have an animal source.
The virus caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to Bat coronavirus, Banroe coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first person to be diagnosed with symptoms was later diagnosed on 1 December 2019; and later that person had no visible connection to the Wet Market Cluster.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial cluster of infected in December 2019.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post suggested that a case found source on 17 November 2019 may have been the first, which occurred in a 55-year-old person from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that new infections in China had so-calledly decreased, but sharply increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China outside China for the first time
The number of infected people may have been low, especially with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, less cases were reported among youth, most of them under the age of 19 and 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Valenc, chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of British population needed to be infected before immunity was achieved.
According to the official protocol, cases refer to the number of individuals who have been tested with COVID-19 and whose test results are positive.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, have formulated formal policies not to test only those with light symptoms.
A survey published on 16 March found that as of January 23, about 86% of the COVID-19 infection in China had not been detected, and this unregistered infection was the source of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than official estimates.
Initial estimates for general reproductive numbers (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A survey published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it was probably 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not, the delay between the growth of symptoms and death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with the most common delay being 14 days.
Approximately 97,000 deaths were reported to have been associated with COVID-19 on April 10, 2020.
As of February 5, 80% of those over 60 years of age and 75% of them had previously had heart disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths in COVID-19 usually refer to those with COVID-19, according to traditional rules.
The death toll resulting from COVID-19 may be very high, since it may not include people who die without testing - such as in homes, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial information from Italy has been found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic has increased by 4-5 times the official COVID death rate.
A proponent of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CCDC) admitted that "we know that the [reported deaths] are less estimated than the actual numbers," a statement that was confirmed by uninformed reports of low count in the United States. Such devaluation often occurs in global epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1
The first death outside mainland China was on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia was on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside of mainland China, in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents of the world, except Antarctica. Several methods are used to determine the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region, and vary by population characteristics such as the amount of testing, quality of healthcare systems, alternatives to treatment, time spent since the early outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of death and infection shows that the number of deaths divides the number of cases diagnosed within a given time limit by the number of cases diagnosed.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of deaths and cases worldwide is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
Numbers vary from region to region.
In China, the ratio of deaths and cases has decreased from 17.3% (whose symptoms appeared between January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (whose first symptoms appeared since February 1, 2020). Other preventive measures include case mortality (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed persons who die of a disease, and infection mortality (IFR) which represents
These statistics are not limited at any time and follow a particular population from infection through analysis of cases.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Center for Evidence Medicine estimates that the mortality rate for this epidemic is overall between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above calculations are similar to a statistical study of the analysis of the effects of the tests on the first indiscriminate test of COVID-19 in Germany and the CFR conjectures.
The WHO has claimed that this epidemic can be controlled.
The maximum limit and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and vary from location to location.
"Having remained unseen, infectious infections usually dominate and then begin to decay when the disease is no longer the host to it," said Makiez Bonnie of Penn State University.
But at the moment it is almost impossible to make a discreet projection of when that will happen.
"China government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that if all countries were united to follow the World Health Organization's advice to prevent the spread of the virus, "it could end by June."
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 would "probably spread for a year or two."
According to research at Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distances and other measures need to be maintained until a vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more).
"I think it's quite impossible that the coronavirus as it gets infected so quickly will disappear completely"" and it can be "a seasonal disease, returning every year"".
The intensity of the return will depend on the immune system and the extent of mutations.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecified, and infected people may be unspecific.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include  exhaustion, respiratory spitting (pneumonia), loss of smell, deficiency in breathing, swelling of throat, headaches, coldness, vomiting, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. The WHO reports that one out of nearly six people become seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists respiratory symptoms, continuous chest pain or stress, sudden confusion, waking up, and bluish appearance or lips as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended. Further development of the disease can cause serious pneumonia, acute
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the test results confirmed the infection, so researchers have advised to monitor and examine those in contact with confirmed infections to avoid the infection.
The Chinese estimate of non-symptomatic ratio varies from several to 44%.
The range of the general incubation period (the period during which infection and symptoms begin) varies from one day to 14 days; usually five days. In examples of uncertainty, the fraction of individuals with COVID-19 initially odor loss accounts for 30% and later loss accounts for 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted by small droplets produced during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact refers to being within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that water particles from an open cough can range from to .
According to some, the virus can also be infected by a small fluid droplet that can be contaminated in the air for long periods of time while speaking. Respiratory red water can also be contaminated during breathing, although the virus is not usually airborne.
Water particles may enter the mouth or nose of those nearby, or they may enter the lungs through breathing.
Some medical procedures such as intusion and cardiopalmonary resistance (CPR) can cause the respiratory discharge to become aerosole and consequently spread by air.
It can also spread when someone touches any contaminated surface including the skin and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the feces, the risk is considered less.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2's oral transmission. The virus is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although it can also be infected before and after symptoms.
Many people have had positive results three days before the symptoms begin, which suggests that the infection is possible before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed non-symptomatic cases, but some countries have detected non-symptomatic infections during contact investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not clear how the disease is easily transmitted, but one person usually infects two to three persons. The virus survives on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, the virus can be found for three days in plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard, and four hours in copper.
It varies depending on moisture and temperature. Pet and other animals have been positively tested for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, just as after touching other surfaces touched by infected humans.
The severely acute respiratory symptoms of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first discovered from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap because it breaks the virus's protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a source of animal-borne diseases.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically connected with the genus betacoronavirus with two strains from bats in the subgenus servecovirus (Lineage B).
In other crocodile samples (Batcov RatG13) the entire genome level is 96% identical.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the GNOME sequence between the virus in the bonorouin and the virus in the human body.
In comparison with the entire GNOME, it has been found that the bonroe has at least 92% genetic similarities between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the bonroe acted as a host in the middle.
The infection can be diagnosed by the virus temporarily depending on the symptoms, but ultimately confirmed by the reverse transmission polymerase chain response (RRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected red blood.
A study comparing CT with PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many of its photographic properties coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as the first row test for COVID-19 diagnosis".
The WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first being issued on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test may be done on the sample of breath or blood.
The results are generally obtained within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal soybe, but may also be used on a throat soybe. Several laboratories and companies are preparing cerebral tests that detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these were proved to be sufficiently correct to be approved for far-reaching use.
In the United States, the Ceroological Tests built by Chellex were allowed to be used only by approved laboratories in emergency situations.
The characteristics of symptomatic people taking photographs in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include unsymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and the absence of pure fusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images from tests of confirmed cases.
For mixing with other infections such as the Adenovirus, the PCR has restricted forming any icon and identifying COVID-19 without any confirmation.
A large survey in China compared PCR to the CT results in the chest and explained that although imaging this infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it be considered as a screening device in epidemic-affected areas.
The artificial intellectual evolution birth agency has been developed which prepares the characteristics of the virus through radiograph and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining overall personal good hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing in tissue and simply throwing the tissue into a trash container.
Those already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distances are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have advised or controlled all unnecessary travel from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached its spreading level in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to the community, and some people in the community do not know where or how they were infected. Health care providers in the care of someone who could be infected are recommended to use evidence alert, contact alert, and eye protection. It is vital for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and find out those in contact to prevent further infection.
Privacy concerns have been raised as the administration used mobile phone location information for this purpose, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations issued statements calling for limiting such surveillance.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on favorable privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to log on a user's mobile phone to others.
Then users will receive a message if they are in contact with a COVID-19 positive person. There are some misconceptions about how to prevent the infection, such as  washing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to produce one.
Hand washing was recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CCDC recommends that people occasionally wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are apparently dirty; before eating; before brushing the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Since the virus can be killed by domestic soap outside the human body, it explodes the virus's protective bubbles.
The CDC suggests that when soap and water are not available, at least 60% alcohol-contained sanitary should be used instead.
The WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands.
Surfaces can be removed by means of several solutions (in case of stenless steel surfaces, within a minute of contact with antibiotics), which include 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidon-iodine.
Other solutions such as Benjalconium chloride and chlohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CCDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a place like office or daycare, the office, bathroom, common space, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by sick people should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their face and nose with elbows or cover them with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of the tissue properly.
Those with risk of infection are recommended to wear surgical masks. A mask can control the amount of fluids emitted when speaking, when sneezing, or when coughing.
The WHO has issued a guideline on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Virologist Stephen Griffin of Leeds University, "wearing masks can reduce people's tendency to touch the face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand cleanliness."
The WHO advises healthy people to wear masks only if they have high risk, such as those serving a person with COVID-19, although they also admit that wearing masks can help avoid people touching their faces.
Some countries have started to encourage public use of face masks.
In the United States, the CCDC advises wearing non-medical masks made of cloth. China specifically advises healthy members of people to use disposable medical masks, especially when coming near (1 metres (3 feet) or less) others.
Hong Kong has recommended wearing a surgical mask when traveling to public transportation or while staying in public places.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to wear masks or cover nose and face when going out.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask while traveling to crowded areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that every grocery store must wear a face mask when entering.
Israel requests all its residents to wear masks whenever they go outside.
Taiwan, which has produced about ten million masks daily since mid-March, needs to wear masks on trains and interstate buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks whenever you go outside and suggests domestic-made masks for those who cannot buy it.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes controlling the spread of infection by reducing close communication between individuals and slowing the spread of the disease.
Methods include quarantine; restricting travel; closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shops.
Individuals can apply methods of establishing social distance by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding populated areas, greeting without touching, and maintaining physical distance from one another.
Many governments now make it mandatory or advised to maintain social distance in areas affected by the outbreak of the disease.
According to the advice of U.S. government authorities and health institutions, the maximum size of gathering rapidly dropped from 250 people (unless it was known that COVID-19 had spread in the area) to 50 and then to 10.
"In March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gathering of more than two people. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and damaged immune systems are at an increasing risk of serious illness and complications, and the CCDC has advised them to stay at home as much as possible in areas of outbreak
The use of the term "social distance" has been affected in such a way that it has led to complete social isolation instead of encouraging people to communicate with others in alternative ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the epidemic period."
It included counsel to have sexual relations only with someone who lives with you who does not have the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation is recommended at home for those infected with COVID-19 and who doubt they have been infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments make or suggest self-quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
The most severe instructions to quarantine oneself have been issued for groups at high risk.
People who have been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region that has a widespread infection are recommended to stay quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last possible contact.
The techniques for controlling an outbreak are suppression and mitigation.
In the early stages of the outbreak, prevention is carried out, and aims at introducing and vaccinating infectious measures in addition to finding and isolating infected people to stop the spread of the disease among the remaining population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts go to the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken to reduce the spread and reduce its impact on health care and society.
At the same time, both containment and metigation may have to accept a mixed standard.
Reduction of the maximum limit of epidemics is part of dealing with the outbreak of an infectious disease, known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.
It reduces the risk of health care and allows more time for vaccines and treatment to improve.
Other ways in which the outbreak can be controlled include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and quarantine; public distance measures, such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; recognizing and involving the public to participate in such other measures; also environmental measures, such as cleaning the surface.
Other countries have also adopted multiple standards to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and local quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance to infected people who quarantined themselves and imposed major fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the manufacture of facial masks and increased fines on fraud of medical supplies. The pretense of efforts by Great Britain and the United States proves that there is a major challenge to mitigation and suppression.
While the most desirable resolution principles have reduced the maximum demand for healthcare to 2/3 percent and death to half, health systems are still bewildered by the consequences of millions of deaths.
Suppression may be a preferred method, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to be transmitted to human populations (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), since otherwise the infection of the virus returns quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to prevent the epidemic causes social and economic damage.
No specific antiviral drugs are allowed for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway with testing of existing drugs.
Symptoms may be relieved by over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and rest.
Depending on the severity of the illness, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and breathing assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can be worse.
Multiple compounds approved in the past for treating other viral diseases are being studied to use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some traditional and domestic remedies help to alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and acquisition of health centers for COVID-19 patients have been described primarily as preventive measures to prevent the outbreak of the disease by the WHO.
ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary medical supply centers to remove sources at multiple levels, which include increasing efforts to monitor COVID-19 tests, increasing intensive monitoring by separating and separating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing available ventilation
There are various theories as to where the case (supposedly Patient Zero) may have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was found on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei slowly increased.
These were mostly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where living animals were also sold, and one theory suggests that the virus came from one of such animals; or, in other words, it has an animal source. A pneumonia cluster of unknown causes was discovered on 26 December and treated by doctor Zhang Xijian (Zhang Xijian) at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were condemned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was condemned by his high-ranking staff for expressing dangers.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
In early January, Wuhan submitted several cases of unknown pneumonia that are subject to investigation. At the initial stage of the outbreak, the number of cases has doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid 2020, with the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and a major rail junction, the virus spread to other parts of China.
On January 20, China reported that about 140 new cases were found in one day, including two people from Bejiang and one from Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data showed that 6174 people already had symptoms as of January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States has seen the world's largest number of confirmed cases, surpassing China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 people have been healed.
There was at least one infection case in about 200 countries and regions.
Because of the European outbreak, many countries in the Shengen region restricted free movement and imposed border control.
National reactions include some repressive measures such as isolation (known as lockdown or lockdown) and curfews. As of April 2, approximately 300 million people or 90% of the population, are in one type of lockdown in the United States, over 50 million people are in the Philippines, approximately 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased two days later to 2.6 billion - about one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was found in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; however, according to an uncertain report, the earliest case was found on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Xijian noticed a cluster of pneumonia for unknown reasons on December 26, after which his hospital informed Wuhan Xianghan CDC on December 27.
Primary genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
"After these notifications were published, police were warning doctors in Wuhan to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human infection."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign which was later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to control the spread of the virus.
"On January 23, a Cordon Sanitar was announced, described as "the largest quarantine in human history", which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei and affected a total of 57 million people."
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year (January 25) festival has been canceled in many places.
Officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
After Leiceshan Hospital, another hospital was built to care for additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, the China Convention Center and Stadium converted 14 other centers in Wuhan into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took steps to take additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including a health-related declaration for tourists and the extension of Spring holidays.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have adopted various measures especially for schools and universities.
Several regions of China were arranged to work from a distant location.
Travel within and outside Hubei was restricted.
Government transportation systems across China were changed and museums were temporarily closed.
"Regulatory restrictions were imposed on public movement in many cities and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some external restrictions. After the outbreak entered its global episode in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries."

In response, intense efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the abolition of religious services, major events in sports and other social events such as concerts and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The cinema industry also fell, and the Vatican cancelled the Holy Week celebration in Rome during the last week of the Christian Lenin's Repentant season.
Many diocese have advised elderly Christians to stay home instead of coming to Sunday months; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are holding worship without getting out of their cars.
With the closure of its churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese in Rome and the emptiness of Christian pilgrims in St. Peter's Square, other religious directors have also canceled services and limited crowds in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced cancelling Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and subsequently religious sites were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents of the country from entering the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disaster in the global sporting calendar after World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have either been cancelled or suspended.
"The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event "will be rescheduled to a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other sporting places around the world have been closed, and live poker tournaments have either been suspended or cance
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups on gambling sites indicate that many gamblers have turned online. The entertainment industry has also suffered due to the suspension or cancellation of jalala tours by music groups.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live streaming music shows or web-based "festivals" so that artists could accomplish, distribute and promote their work."
Online, numerous internet memes with the theme of the coronavirus have spread, which are ridiculous and draw away attention from the time of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, prejudice, unduly fear of foreigners, and racism have also been observed against Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people in the hotspots of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed.
Reports from February have documented racist attitudes on different groups of Chinese people around the world, claiming that they deserve the virus or that what is happening to them is just revenge.
In some African countries, anti-China sentiment has also emerged.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on regional origins.
There was support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for the people in the virus-affected region.
In accordance with the progress of infection in new hotspot countries, Italy's people, experienced in the horrible experience of the COVID-19 outbreak, could be the object of suspicion and foreign threats. Citizens of countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially signed petitions/ petitions to lobby for banning the entry of Chinese people to their countries.
In Japan, the hashtag #Don'tComeIntoChineseRajapan became very popular.
In addition to racist violence against Chinese in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as other Asians, attacks have been reported to be increasing.
"U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus", as critics consider the term racist and anti-Chinese."
Ukrainian protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian residents and overseas passengers from Wuhan to Nabi Sanjari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in major cities in India are reported to have been harassed related to the COVID-19 outbreak.
"Dilip Ghosh, the principal of the West Bengal state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "for that reason God has taken vengeance against them."
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata strongly criticized this statement in Kolakata and called it  false. Zenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants in China have increased during the pandemic, with foreigners being described as  foreign trash and identified as  extraction.
There are other newspapers, including Pewal, which have removed their partial or entire coverage of the coronavirus.
Many specific publications have produced science articles related to the outbreak that are available on open access.
Some scientists prefer to publish their results quickly on innovative servers such as BioRoxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 include methods that detect the presence of the virus and detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed only to detect RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infection.
Serology can be used for both diagnosis and public surveillance.
Antibodies tests show how many people had the disease, including people whose symptoms were insignificant or unsymptomatic.
The results of these experiments can be determined by an accurate mortality rate of the disease and the group immunity of the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had credible information on the outbreak of the virus in their population until March 2020.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge difference in the number of tests done across the country.
This difference may significantly affect the mortality rate in reported cases, which is likely to be significantly high in some countries.
The samples of the respiratory system, including the nasopharyngeal sample, can be tested using real-time reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The results generally range from a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test with throat soybe is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but may continue to increase its number in the lungs.
In cases of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise, sample material can be taken from the deepest of the respiratory tract by a suction catheter, or a cough emitting material may be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in Charit, Berlin in January 2020, using Real-Time Reverse Transmission Polymerase Chain Reaction (RRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a clinical-level PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It looks for the common "E" gene in all beta coronaviruses and the characteristic RDRP gene of SARS-CoV-2." BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to receive an emergency approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States
The older versions of the test kits had unresolved results due to flawed reagents in one of the three genetic tests and created a barrier to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples were successfully processed a day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then the state and local laboratories were not allowed to start tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration) under an emergency use authorization. U.S. business labs began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests across the country on the basis of RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics similarly availed nationwide COVID-19 tests on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restriction was declared; sample collection and processing must be performed according to the requirements of the CCDC.
COVID-19 tests in Russia were prepared and manufactured by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
The test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare on 11 February 2020. On 12 March 2020, reports were made that Mayo Clinique prepared a test to detect the COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA's approval for a test that could be performed in greater quantities within 3.5 hours, thus allowing an instrument to perform about 4,128 tests
On March 19, 2020, the FDA gave Abbott Laboratories an Emergency Use Authorization, EUA for a test on Abbott's M2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Hyologic, Labcorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cepheid received an EUA from FDA for a test on 21 March 2020, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, this method can produce positive results in less than five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 these devices in the U.S., and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test uses a monoclonal antibodies, which are specifically tied to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, and is being prepared in Taiwan with the hope that it can produce results within 15 to 20 minutes, just like a fast in
"A literary review in March 2020 concluded that "the importance of chest radiograph in the early stages is very low in diagnosis, but data from CT [computed tomography] can be present even before the introduction of symptoms."
CT's features include a bilateral, multilobar ground-glass opacity with a vertical, symmetric and backward distribution.
With the emergence of the disease, subplioral dominance, crazy paving and consolidation occur.
A study comparing CT with PCR in Wuhan, the current epidemic's source, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less specific, and many of its photographic properties coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as the first row test for COVID-19 selection or diagnosis". According to March 2020, the CCDC recommended PCR for preliminary selection tests.
The immune response to infection is part of the production of antibodies consisting of IgM and IgG.
Evaluations can be performed by point-of-care testing (PoCT) in central laboratories and central laboratories (CLT) to determine the immunity of the infection.
In many essential laboratories, high-efficiency automated systems will be able to perform these asses, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single sample of marginal blood is commonly used for CLT, although serial samples may also be used to follow immune reactions.
Generally, a single sample of blood is taken by piercing the skin for PoCT.
A collection measure is not required before testing such as the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 institutions that provided notifications to the agency as needed and are now able to distribute their antibodies tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test's capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, and therefore is much faster than the traditional PCR evaluation of viral RNA.
In early April, the United Kingdom learned that no antibodies testing kits they bought were good enough to be used.
"Hong Kong has developed an initiative where suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", he spits in it, sends it back, and receives the test results shortly thereafter." The British NHS has announced that they are introducing an initiative to test suspicious cases at home, which reduces the risk of the patient being infected by
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea perform the fastest, most widespread tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statistical Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the capacity to test about 12,000 people per day and 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is ordered by a physician, health insurance bears the costs.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity to perform 1,60,000 tests per week.
Drive in tests were conducted in many major cities on March 19.
The total number of tests completed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that at least 483,295 samples were tested until the calendar week of 12/2020, including and , and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a method to collect samples from 64 patients to test the sample, and further tests were
The supervision of the construction by BGI's founder Wang Xian and the completion of it within 5 days showed that if the test capacity did not increase at the right time, the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the costs related to quarantine would have doubled.
Huo-Yan labs have quickly followed the Wuhan Laboratory in 12 cities across China such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020, the testing capacity was a total of 50,000 per day. Open sources, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays, have been published which can only use 93 tests to test a maximum of 1122 patient samples for COVID-19. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need of robotic liquid handler.
By March, the lack of reagents and inadequate quantities became a restriction in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some researchers to explore sample preparation protocols where samples were heated at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for subsequent tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates are now testing more people for the coronavirus than in other countries and are on the road to increase the level of testing to reach most of the population.
"It was a combination of drive-through capabilities and a population-size mass production laboratory purchased from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency identification laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing several times the number of RT-PCR tests per day, and is the first lab in the world with this range outside China.
Various methods of testing were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The German method of producing kits was adopted by the World Health Organization to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce their own kits.
The German protocol was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control (U.S. Centers for Disease Control) was not available until 28 January, delaying the tests available in the US. In the early days of the outbreak, there was a problem between China and the United States about the reliability of the test kits, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits
In contrast, experts say that higher testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has developed testing capacity for several years, mainly in private labs.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increasing experimental programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for tests due to the widespread infection of the virus caused the creation of thousands of test work on private US labs, and pressure on supply of swabs and chemical reactors.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
"There were "errors" in the test kits prepared by the CCDC in the United States; then the administration removed bureaucratic obstacles that prevented private experiments. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results were wrong."
The organization explained that wrong results may result from failure to collect samples or to use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the error-produced kits, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the error-produced test kits purchased from China. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovich (Matovi) offered to throw them into the Danube River." The Turkish Ministry of Health Ates Kara (Ate Kara) said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had "high errors" and that they "did not use them." UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced early in April 2020 that they were not used."
The testing and then quarantine of those who received positive results and the finding of people who contacted SARS-CoV-2 positive results resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the first place to die in COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two tests on the entire population of 3,400 people in a span of about ten days.
About half of the people whose tests were positive had no symptoms and all those identified were quarantine.
The new infection has been completely removed due to restricting travel in communications.
By aggressively tracking people in contact, controlling incoming travel, testing, and quarantining, but without any extreme control, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail companies, the 2020 COVID-19 worldwide pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after a holiday break on March 23.
Some other countries have also controlled the global pandemic with less aggressive lock-downs, such as Iceland and South Korea, by aggressively searching out people in contact, controlling incoming travel, testing, and quarantining.
A statistical study found that death rates are much lower in countries that have more tested than the death rate, perhaps because these countries have been able to identify patients with light or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19, send the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 reference laboratories of the WHO for confirmed tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories there are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The column "How many percent of the tests are positive" in the chart below is influenced by the test policy of the country."
In a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the positive % of the tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, are tested.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the cleaning of a person's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microscopic organisms or other undesirable substances.
"Regular soap washing during certain "important moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the excrement  through the mouthpiece."
Humans may also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membrane).
Five important moments during the day when hand washing with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the underside of the baby, after feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after handling food or raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hand washing can be done with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after.
Before and after caring for the sick.
After changing the diapers or cleaning the child who used the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to healthy habits related to medical treatment.
Washing hands before medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep the hand clean from germs (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and harmful or potentially caused chemicals.
This is especially important for people who care for or work on food in the medical field, but it is also an important method for ordinary people.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including less infection of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; less infection of diarrhoea; less respiratory infection;
and reduce infant mortality during home delivery.
A 2013 survey found that improved handwashing habits can lead to low progress in the length of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, respiratory and diarrhoea-related deaths can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple process can reduce the death rate from this disease by about 50%.
Efforts to encourage handwashing can reduce the epidemic of diarrhea by about thirds, and compare to clean water supply in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap is related to a 48% reduction in cases of diarrhoea. Washing hands with soap as the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) is performed automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the major cause of death in children under five years of age. It kills an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are combined causes of about 3.5 million deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, a strong habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reduce half the death of diarrhea, and reduce one-fourth of deaths from acute respiratory infection.
Handwashing is integrated with other sanitation systems as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing protects from infectious skin diseases (impetago), which are transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying up.
A Danish study in 2012 found that excessive hand washing can result in a skin rash, known as hand eczema or hand skin disease, especially common among health care workers.
Very frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Five important times of the day when hand washing with soap are: after using the bathroom (defecation, excretion), after cleaning the underside of the baby or modifying the napy, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before preparing food or putting hands on raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent infection include before and after treating cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing nose; after touching animal waste or moving the animal; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is low.
A survey of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households were used to wash hands with soap. A 2014 survey found that Saudi Arabia was the highest in 97 percent; the United States was the middle of 77 percent; and China was the lowest in 23 percent. There are now several methods of modifying handwashing habits in times of crisis. Group handwashing is an alternative
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in Philippines is an example of adequate measures to promote the health and education of children.
Such programs include curminus twice a year, along with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water increases the removal of microscopic organisms from the skin.
The main function of soap and detergents is to reduce the barrier and increase the solution.
Water alone is an ineffective skin cleaner because fat and protein, which are components of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is usually done with moderate water flow.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria from previous use.
A few studies that observed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was less likely because the bacteria were washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that "controllable liquids are preferred to be applied without using hands."
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted to health-conscious public.
There is no evidence that antiseptics or antibiotics are recommended for natural antibiotics-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial components such as trichlosan, which have a limited organism resistance.
Hence, antibiotics-resistant strains may not be selected for antibacterial soaps, but may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective ingredients, practical preparation may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and additional skin conditioners (alvera, vitamins, manthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated
Hot water for hand washing is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot soap water is more effective than cool soap water to remove natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to legendary beliefs, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microbial weight on hands.
A non-water-based hand sanitary or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand cleaning material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st centuries, non-water-based alcohol rubs (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitary) began to gain popularity.
In order to reduce the availability of use and the drying effect of alcohol, isopropil is mostly based on alcohol or ethanol prepared together with carboxes (polymers of acrylic acid) or humacants such as liquids or foams with concentrated ingredients such as glycerin.
The addition of mixed hydrogen-peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand savers contain at least 60 to 95% alcohol that is capable of killing bacteria.
Alcohol rubb savers kill bacteria, multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, Herpes, RSV, Rinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rab sanitary contains 70% alcohol that kills 99.97% (equivalent to 3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria after 30 seconds in hand and 99.99% to 99.999% (equivalent to 4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria after hand reduction. Hand savers are the most effective against bacteria and are relatively less effective against some
Alcohol-based hand savers are most common causes of infectious gastroentery, almost completely ineffective against the virus of the Norovirus (or Norwack) type. Adequate hand antiseptics or alcohol rubs should be used to wet both hands well or to cover the top.
The liquid, foam, or gel is rubbed in the front and back of both hands for about 30 seconds until it is dry.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hand washing with hand-sanitary rubs, especially when there is dirt in the hand.
The increasing use of these materials depends on the flexibility of their use and rapid destruction of microscopic organisms; however, soap and water should not be used as proper hand washing replacements if they are not available.
If the formula does not contain emolient and/or skin moisture, frequent use of alcohol-based hand savers can cause dry skin.
The drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
In medical tests, alcohol-based hand savers with softer ingredients caused significantly less tension and dryness in the skin than soap or antibiotics detergents.
Oversensitivity for skin diseases caused by allergy, contact-related dad diseases, or alcohol or alcohol-related substances rarely occur in alcohol hand rabes.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower tendency to initiate painful touch dermatitis became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless materials do not clean the organic matter of the hand but only sterilize the hand.
Since microorganisms are still in hand, hand savers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many microorganisms.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitary depends more on ingredients and preparation, and in past incidents alcohol and alcohol rabs have been significantly less effective than alcohol-free hand sanitary.
More recently, steady and increasing antimicrobial activity has been observed after the application of Benzalconium chloride user preparation, unlike alcohol, which has probably decreased effectiveness after repeated use due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
In low-income societies, many people do not have the means to spend money for soap and use ash or mud instead.
ash or soil can be more effective than water alone but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is an antibiotic substance because in contact with water it produces alkaline solution.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap.
Proper handwashing strategies recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centers for prevention of infection include the following steps:
Wet your hands in flowing water, warm or cold.
Water is suggested because permanent basins may be polluted, but water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Use adequate amount of soap in the back, fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that humans wash their hands better when they use soap rather than water.
Rub it for at least 20 seconds.
During scrubbing, there is a friction that removes bacteria from the skin and further rubbing can remove bacteria from the skin.
Wash it well with water.
Washing the hand in the basin can be polluted again.
Dry with a clean towel or dry in the air.
The wet and wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most excluded are the fingers, wrist, fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and broken nail polish can provide shelter for microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended so that the hands do not become dry; dry skin can damage the skin, increasing the risk of spreading infection.
"In developing countries where tap tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost alternatives can be created for the benefit of handwashing, such as pouring water from a hanging jarken or a suitable hollowed gourd and/or using ash if necessary. Under limited water supply conditions (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving alternatives such as
Tippy-tap is a simple technology where a jug hanged by a rope and a leg-powered liver and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hand.
Hand drying well is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Increasing amounts of research indicate that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the Paper Tube Industry European Tissue Symposium, produced by the Paper Tube Industry European Tissue Symposium and produced by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers, and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the fingers and 254% on the palms.
The average number of bacteria increases by 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palms.
After drying the hands with paper towel after washing, the total bacteria decreases by up to 76% on the fingers and up to 77% on the palm. Scientists also experimented to prove that the method of drying each variety was likely to result in cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air drier, which extracts air at a steady speed of , was able to eliminate microorganisms from hands and units and remove possible pollution from the toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer spreads microscopic organisms to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The paper towel showed no significant expansion of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by Tuv Product und Umvelt (TV Produkt und Umwelt) evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in bacteria in the number of bacteria have been observed after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryer manufacturers exist and have been compared to drying with paper towel.
The lack of soap and water during travel is an alternative to hand washing.
Alcohol-based hand savers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was compulsory in the hospital environment long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelwes discovered the effectiveness of handwashing (in 1846) to prevent diseases in the hospital environment.
There are some electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to forget to wash their hands.
One study has seen a decline in infection rates as they are used.
Medical handwashing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds and uses adequate amounts of soap and water or gel to rub each part of the hand.
The fingers should be tied together and the hands should be rubbed together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a brisel brush may be used to remove it.
Since bacteria can be found in handwater, it is important to clean the foam and dry it with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towel should be used to close the water tap (and if necessary open another door to get out).
This avoids pollution from those surfaces to the hands.
"The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare environment is to remove disease-causing microorganisms (""microorganisms"") and avoid infection."
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the shortage of handwashing in most medical environments remains unacceptable, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget about washing their hands before touching patients, thus infecting microorganisms.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple methods can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published standard handwashing and handwashing displays in the Department of Health Care.
The organization's draft guidelines on hand hygiene for public comments can also be found on its website.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene when regulatory compliance is needed.
"The World Health Organization has "five moments" for hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluid
Before immunization, and
"After care of the patient, the addition of antiseptic chemicals (""medicated"" or "antimicrobial"" soap) to the soap gives the ability to destroy the handwashing material."
For surgery, it is necessary to have a mill to 'screw' your hand without touching it, to wash it with some chlorhoxidine or iodine, to dry the hand after washing, and to have a brush for scrubbing and other sterile devices underneath your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
It usually takes 2-6 minutes to wash the hands and elbows.
Long time (10 min.) is not necessary.
During washing, water from the wrist to the elbow must be prevented from falling back to the palm.
After hand washing is done, hands are dried with sterilized clothes and wear a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is good to wash your hands before and after serving the sick person or use antiseptics.
For controlling the staffylococcal infection in hospitals, it was found that the maximum benefits of handwashing were from the first 20% washing, and the additional benefits were little when the repetition of handwashing was extended to over 35%.
Bacterial infectious diseases are transmitted three times in foods compared to bacterial-resistant soap washing. For a period of 30 seconds, comparing hand washing with bacterial-resistant soap with alcohol-based liquid, each showed that hand washing alcohol reduced 26% of bacterial pollution than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water/water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rabbits to reduce the H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium diphysilic seeds from the hand. In health care environments, hand washing, workers' education about the availability of alcohol-based hand rabbits, and issues of workers' written and oral reminders may be involved to improve hand hygiene.
More research is needed on which of these improvements is most effective in different healthcare environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a saving, essential way to achieve good health, even good nutrition.
However, lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces creates a challenge to achieving the habit of universal hand washing.
For example, in most parts of rural Africa, although there are cheap alternatives to build handwashing spaces, handwashing mills are rare near each private or public toilets.
However, low hand washing rate may be due to deeply ingrained habits rather than lack of soap or water/water.
Propaganda and counsel on handwashing with soap can affect ethical decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and lead to people's long-term habit changes.
To work effectively, it requires observation and evaluation.
"A systematic review of 70 surveys shows that community-based methods in LMIC are effective in handwashing while social marketing campaigns are less effective." An example of handwashing campaigns in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take easy, affordable steps to ensure that students use soap among other healthy needs."
When the minimum standard is achieved, schools can reach three stars from one to the end.
Establishing handwashing stations can be part of the handwashing campaign to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness raising campaign to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
DALYS has considered several studies on the overall cost saving of handwashing in developing countries.
However, a review suggests that handwashing with soap is relatively cheaper than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health  especially for people in vulnerable conditions, such as hospital mothers who have just given birth to babies or injured soldiers - two pioneers of hand cleanliness first recognized it in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelwes, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nighting
Until then, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called miasmus.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-related diseases and health care-related infection led the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centers to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters with "accurate handwashing techniques" were hung in public toilets and beside handwashing sinks in office buildings and airport toilets in Germany."
"This phrase "throw away a person's hand" means a person's reluctance to take responsibility for the matter or to share in the wrongdoing."
It originates from parts of Matthew's Bible where Pontius Pilate dropped his hands off the decision to crucifix Jesus Christ, but with more widespread use among some English communities, it has become a language expression.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands in a mad manner trying to clean up the imagined stains by expressing her guilt over the crime she committed and induced her husband to commit the crime.
It has also been found that humans are more likely to wash their hands when they think or think about immoral acts than others and are more likely to value handwashing equipment.
"Furthermore, those allowed to wash their hands after such an intention are less likely to engage in other "cleanup" compensation activities, such as volunteers."
Religions recommend hand washing for both healthy and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water/water to wash hands but not using soap, is a feature of religious rituals in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat Yadaim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Ozu in Islam. Religions recommend healthy hand washing especially after
Hand washing is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam after using toilet.
And, before and after each meal, hand washing is mandatory in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Work risk control for COVID-19
Work risk controls for COVID-19 are applications of professional safety and health methods to control risks to prevent the COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls at work depend on the location and the tasks to be done, a risk assessment of sources of contact, the intensity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be afraid of a COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), work with less risk of contact involves minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which general measures for prevention of infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory
Medium-risk jobs in contact include jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected but need frequent or close contact with people who may be infected due to the current disease spreading among the community in businesses or because of international travel.
This includes employees who have public contact, such as in schools, in high popular working conditions, and in some high-crowded retail spaces.
In addition to primary prevention measures, disaster control measures for this group include availability of air filters with improved capacity, sneez guards, and personal protective equipment when confronted with COVID-19 infected persons.
The OSHA considers health workers and personnel working in the morgue to be at a high risk of contact with confirmed or suspicious COVID-19 infected persons. The risk is further increased if these workers apply aerosol-producing mechanisms or to collect or handle samples of confirmed or suspicious COVID-19 infected persons.
Suitable risk controls for these employees include engineering controls such as negative pressure-controlled ventilation rooms, and personal protective materials suitable for employment work.
The outbreak of COVID-19 in the workplace can have many effects.
Workers may abstain from work because they become ill, have to care for others, or fear potential contact.
Business patterns can change both in terms of what products are demanded and how to buy these products (such as shopping at no rush hours or through delivery or drive-through services).
Eventually, transportation from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. An infectious disease preparation and response plan can be used to guide protective measures.
Plans address various risk levels associated with workplaces and tasks, including risk factors originating from the source of contact, homes and communities, and individual risk factors for workers, such as old age or chronic medical disease.
They also described the controls needed to address those risks and the plans to prepare for situations that might result from the outbreak of the disease.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of response to the outbreak include reducing infection among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business activities, and reducing adverse effects on other companies in their supply chain.
The intensity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the reactions received.
The sequence of danger control is a structure widely used to control professional protection and health effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal protection materials.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on the behavior of employees, and this can be the most saving solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or methods that require action by the employee or employer.
Private protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the worker's risk, such as properly fixed (such as a respirator), continuously and properly weared, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, and properly opened, cleaned, and saved or canceled to avoid pollution.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA), the minimum professional contact with people and other colleagues in jobs with less risk of contact.
Fundamental measures recommended for all workplaces include repeated and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing etiquette with mouth covering during sneezing and coughing, tissue and garbage disposal, preparing for telecommunications or shifts when needed, discourage workers from using other equipment and materials, and
An essential step to protect workers, clients, visitors, and others at work is to quickly identify and isolate potentially infected persons.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention advises workers with severe respiratory symptoms to stay at home until they are free from fever, fever symptoms, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-decreasing or other symptoms altering drugs, and sick leave principles should be flexible, which allow workers to stay at home to care for a sick family member
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs in contact include jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 recently need to be closely contacted within six ft (1.8 m) due to the current disease that has spread among the community in business locations or because of a person's recent international travel to a place where CO
This includes workers with public contact, such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and in some stores with high crowd. Engineering controls for and for higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing, installing a drive-through window
Workers in these risk groups rarely need to use respirators.
Proper controls to protect the staff and other passengers if a person gets sick on a plane, include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, specifying a member of the staff to serve the sick person, and giving the sick person a face mask or telling the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue while sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to the call of a sick traveler or when touching body fluids or possible contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has fever, constant coughing or respiratory respiratory problems, possibly use additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other cancellables should be cancelled in a biological risk bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and sterilized. For commercial ships, including pleasure vessels and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel when sick, isolating oneself, and immediately informing the ship's medical center when fever or other symptoms
In the ideal case, medical follow-up should be held in the cabin of the person isolated. In the case of schools and infant care facilities, regardless of the infection in the public community, if any infected person enters the school building, the CCDC recommends a short shutdown to clean or sterilize it.
When the disease spreads to a minimum to medium level in the public community, social distance management strategies may be implemented, such as canceling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or eating in a cafeteria; increasing distances between desks, separating office visits and holidays, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu
When the disease spreads widely in the local community, it may be considered to increase school hours in addition to the social distance strategy. The immediate health risk of law enforcement workers performing daily traditional activities is considered less by the CCDC.
Law enforcement officers who must contact people who are confirmed to have COVID-19 or are suspected of it are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical technicians, with appropriate personal protective equipment.
If employees come in close contact when they are in danger, they should clean and sterilize their duty belts and equipment with a domestic sanitation spray or whip before reusing them, and follow evidence management methods to control and cancel the PPE used.
OSHA considers the high or high risk of contact with certain healthcare and death services employees.
High risk jobs in contact include healthcare supplies, assistance, laboratory and medical transport workers who come in contact with patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If employees perform aerosol-producing methods, or collect or handle samples from patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, they are at high risk of contact.
Erosol-producing methods include injecting tubes, coughing methods, bronchoscope, some dental methods, and collecting samples by injecting tests or materials.
Highly risky, death-related jobs include workers involved in preparing the dead bodies of people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; this becomes very highly risky if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risky groups include separation rooms for patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, when aerosol-gene
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable in some health care and burial environments.
Samples should be handled in accordance with the warnings of level 3 of biofertility.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated from individual waiting areas on the basis of whether they are suspected of contracting COVID-19. For people working within 6 feet of those known or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2, and for people performing aerosol-producing methods, OSHA also recommends respite other PPEs.
In the United States, a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program, including health tests, training, and medical tests, a NIOSH-approved N95 or better filtering facepiece respiratory must be used.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend coverall, since COVID-19 does not spread through physical liquid components, but is a respiratory disease.
The WHO recommends a surgical mask for entrance screening workers only.
The WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shields, gowns, and gloves for those collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing method.
If an aerosol-generator process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Seeing the inadequacy of PPE supplies worldwide, WHO suggests using telemedicine, transparent windows, and physical concealment to reduce the need for PPE, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a home where a COVID-19-positive patient is infected, using PPE only for specific purposes, continuing using it without removing the respirator when caring for multiple pa

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 is an event that makes clear the universal human interaction and our responsibilities to one another.
We have no previous record for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the universal empathy, cooperation and community building at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, confidence and care we have seen through emails, calls and chat among all our colleagues is a remarkable verification of the incredible people we are lucky enough to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues.
Last week, a man exchanged his praise for our work with me.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to view Wikipedia at this moment and how powerful it is to be available online and available.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites on or pay our colleagues or keep our communities safe.
Wikipedia's information is needed in the world, more than ever.
It is a moment when not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant changes from this next week in the way we work together.
Synchronizing Our Work and Schedule
As Robin had mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and set timetables for the days and months to come.
We considered the best way to sustain the organization at this time.
Most of us wanted to remove pressure and support our purpose for a long time.
If you need to dial back, it's okay.
For all workers, contractors, and contractual workers:
Until the next notification, our daily activities will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We're not announcing holidays - the mission can use you if you are able to work at more normal times.
However, the world is uncertain at the moment, and whether you need to care for a loved one or get groceries or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
Needless to say, but we are saying it.
No illness leave or PTO is needed - just tell your manager, and help your team correct calendars and schedules so that the main areas of the work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can assist and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from the authorities.)
Those working as hours will be paid full salary.
We have already said, and we are again committed to respect our commitment to our contractors and colleagues working as bells.
All will be paid on the basis of the normal hours they work in normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we help you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their stress from the world around us to a particular direction.
What we do can be incredibly productive, especially at such times.
Again, it is about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager so that we can know what is expected and conform to it.
Some activities are considered essential.
There are things we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential work that may require additional assistance.
We will start a process with all of our departments to evaluate current goals and change our focus to cooperate with what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, and only we will focus on the most essential projects.
If we work slowly now, we won't get hurt later.
We are not planning to recover double time after the pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to finish work within the time limit, which is not realistic now.
We admit that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new targets and time limits.
What happens with the APP?
To harmonize our new reality and our daily working hour expectations, we also want to harmonize the time limit for delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an expansion of our 2019-2020 plan, which will give more time to prepare budgets to give employees priority to essential work, to care for themselves and loved ones, as well as to comply with the demands of people who want or need to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This expansion of time greatly reduced the current plan's load and the pressure throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week and we will update representatives and groups as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, contact and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been in contact with the COVID-19 virus.
With great caution, however, we employed a virus remover team at the San Francisco office to sterilize all surfaces.
They used a hospital-suited antivirus solution to sterilize each surface and lobby and the elevator banks entering our floor.
The building is responsible for its own services by employing protocol-using products that help protect their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which exchanges its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office was transferred to a fully remote setup, in harmony with the instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a place in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from a distance for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be synchronization, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into smaller parts over a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, set an agenda, and send the curriculum in advance.
Make video the default, along with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connections.
To facilitate each meeting, have a lead, ask someone to monitor the questions on the chat, and keep an eye on the speaker's list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes cooperatively).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Use your Wellness Reimbursement for snacks.
Join Slack's #remoteties channel to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR operating team is focusing on Weiboner-based argonomics guidelines to help increase the distribution of work throughout the Foundation.
This past week, we asked all community donors to cancel public events such as Wikimedia-funded Editathon until WHO announced the pandemic's end.
We told them that we realized that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete their agreed grant program and that no one will be punished for delaying or amending these goals.
This coming week we will inspire additional guidance for Wikimania and other regional and subject-based community conferences.
Depression because of the disruption of the general attitude from the entire global community, but at the same time, in Wikimedia and elsewhere, they seem to have both the ability and clarity to focus on their own community.
In the coming days, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the public to monitor the impact and follow our contacts with them.
Connecting to issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special worker meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting to each other.
All of us are united in this situation and will help in any way we can.
In the meantime you can continue searching for information from this email, and get other essential information about COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with workers living in countries currently significantly affected.
Please let me know if you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream or coverage challenge, or if you need help on other matters, and do not hesitate to work with CRT.
We are here to help provide assistance and coordination as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive information, please email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be viewed as a sacrifice of our work and responsibility.
Rather, it is a recognition that at the moment we may have to adjust our activities and responsibilities in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to assist one another so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need in our movements, and provide the services the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work awaits us.
Now is the time to assist one another and to make room for the important work to come in the weeks and perhaps in the months to come.
To do this requires cooperation from all of you, and so we want you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can stay healthy when you need it.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Dorine D, Gregory V, Haime V, Joel L, Linett L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Haime V, Janine Yu, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Bangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cells of the lungs, arteries, hearts, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activities of the concerned angiotencin-transforming enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotencin-II and by increasing the ang(1-7) it becomes a committed drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as a place to enter cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc that is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein has a N-terminal peptides M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose enzyme activity is uncovered on the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The outgoing domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by other enzymes known as shades, and as a result, the soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and eventually excreted through urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the membrane of cells related to the II type of alviolus in the lungs, anterocytes in the small intestines, most of the organs' arteries and veins, and slender muscle cells in the arteries.
ACE2 mRNA expressions are also found in the cerebral cortex, stritam, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance of ACE.
ACE divides the hydrogen I into vasoconstricting hydrogen II.
ACE2 separates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalin from ANGOTENCIN II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator ANGOTENCIN (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can distinguish several other peptides, including [des-arg9]-bradykinin, applene, neurotensin, dynorphine, and ghrelin.
ACE2 controls the membrane transmission of the neutral amino acid transmitter SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnoup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the center point of cell access to some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the enzymetic domain of ACE2 contains the protein SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the spike S1 on the surface of the cell, resulting in endocytosis and displacement of both viruses and enzymes in the endosome.
This entry process also requires primaking of the S protein by the host serin protein TMPRSS2, the prevention of which is currently under investigation as a possible healing. This has helped some to speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory organizations have recommended that evidence ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy continue.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "Compare with controls, the use of ACE inhibitors involved significantly 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia."
"In addition, the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE preventives, especially those with high risk of pneumonia, was also reduced."
"The decrease in the mortality rate related to neumonia also involved the use of ACE inhibitors, although the results were less powerful than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (RHACE2) was considered a novel therapy for severe lung damage and was present in pigs with symptoms of acute respiratory respiratory symptoms with leapopolisaccharide to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation.
In humans the half-life of RHACE2 is about 10 hours and the work begins in 30 minutes, while the effect period (stability) is 24 hours.
Various experiments suggest that rhACE2 may show hope for individuals who are unable to tolerate the first-class Renin-Angiotencin System Inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or who have illnesses in which angiotencin II circulation increases. RhACE2 has been evaluated in diagnosis for acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute respiratory
"B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps designed to identify contacts as a response to the Coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, i.e. the process of identifying persons (""recognition"") in contact with an infected person."
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official assistance in some areas and territories.
Several infrastructures have been developed to create communication detection apps.
Privacy concerns have been expressed, especially about systems that work on geographical locations of app users.
Relatively intrusive entry options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log the user to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would directly merge the effectiveness of helping such bluetooth-based apps into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay has launched an application that allows citizens to check if they have contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used across more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was created by the local IT community, published as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia Stop Corona!, a bluetooth-based app that aims to identify symptoms of potentially infected persons and provide quick responses to health care authorities.
The app was created by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since 14 April 2020, the app has been awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government stated that the Connection Search app is in progressive stages in development and that it will be available for operation within a few weeks." Similar apps (""StopCovid"") have been planned in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on the TraceTogether app in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to launch a geographing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow to ensure that they will not leave home.
Professor Ross Anderson of the Department of Security Engineering at Cambridge University lists several possible practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive and lack of effectiveness if app acceptance is limited to a small portion of the population.
In addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set restrictions that any type of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its app store, limiting them to "governmental" or otherwise notable companies."
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Those who advocate for privacy expressed their concerns regarding the implications of censorship on people using Covid-19 apps, especially whether censorship infrastructures designed to deal with the coronavirus global pandemic will be finished after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and hundreds of other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organization announced eight conditions regarding government projects:
"Censorship must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate."
To increase monitoring and surveillance, there must be sunset trend;
Use of data for COVID-19 purposes must be limited;
Protection of information and protection of unknown identities and protection on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance had to be done to stop the incidence of discrimination and marginalisation;
The issue of sharing any data with a third party should be made clear in the law;
Protection against abuse and citizens have the right to protest against abuse.
Important participation will be required by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Kews Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of fixed surveillance by removing them from their device's operating systems if they no longer need traceing.
Some countries used network-based surveillance instead of apps, which removed both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based detection was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined locations have significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems on the central server need access to personal location data; multiple privacy-saving systems have been developed that use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an appless system was used to monitor contacts.
Instead of using an employed app, the system gathered tracking data from various sources, including data from mobile device tracking and transaction data on cards, and combined these and sent notifications to potentially infected people via text messages.
In addition to using this information to warn about potential contacts, the government has made location information available to the public, some of which have been approved due to far-reaching changes in the information privacy law after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been released.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording the nearness of other cell phone users using Bluetooth low energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single code of conduct. Decentralized code of conduct includes privacy sensitive code and methods for decentralized privacy-preservation (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary communication numbers (TCN, Fka communication numbers, CEN
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and all occurs within the matching device.
Privacy group SafePaths is developing at MIT Media Lab, a platform for privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or road intersection data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a White Paper titled "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" (Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic), which was published in March 2020.

B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against COVID-19 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed diagnosis, multiple attempts have been made to produce such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that they did not expect the defense vaccine of the effective virus, SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
In April there were five vaccine candidates in the Phase I protection research.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak broke out around the world, leading to considerable investment and research activities to produce a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published GNOME to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CEPI initiative to produce the vaccine conditions are speed, production capacity, large-scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working to research and develop in early 2020 to produce effective vaccines against COVID-19.
Major platform targets that have advanced to stage I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Face I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Virus-borne vectors (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino biologix, Adenovirus Type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 total vaccinated persons are in the initial stage of progress, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Millken Institute) and 37 others have been reported, but all of this is based on a slightly published information (conceived to be planned).
Phase I-II tests conduct primary protection and immunity tests, and when determining a more specific, effective dose, are usually carried out in irregular, plassebo-controlled and multiple sites.
Phase III trials, including vaccine test effectiveness and control groups for prevention of disease, usually involve more participants, while monitor adverse effects on favorable drug levels.
"From 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed early in April 2020), 74 have not yet been humanely evaluated (though under "primary" research).
Around 24 January 2020, Queensland University in Australia announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecularly bound vaccine that would correct viral proteins genetically to arouse immune response.

In late March, the Canadian government, along with numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian organizations and universities, including the initiatives of the University of Medicago and Saskatchewan, announced $275 million funding for 96 research projects on medical protection against COVID-19.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million in particular to produce COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national "Vaccin Bank" for several new vaccines that can be used when another COVID-19 outbreak occurs."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a possible COVID-19 vaccine test on rats called PittCoVacc, which stated that "SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines discovered by MNA responded to strong antigen-specific antibodies [in the case of rats] that appeared at the beginning of the 2nd week after vaccine."
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, using bacteriophages that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities created merged resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
In Australia, 4,170 healthcare workers are being enrolled for an additional intra-intra-train trial.
There is a possibility that vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic rodents, other laboratory animals, and non-human mammals initiated early studies indicating the need for biofertility-level 3 control levels and international coordination for management of living viruses to ensure standard protection methods.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS broke out, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a suitable template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) MERS vaccine that completed the first clinical tests in humans and three more are ongoing, all of them viral-vector vaccines, two Adenovarian-vectors (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-Vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts are related to patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscles pain, diarrhea, throat pain, smell loss, and abdominal pain.
The time from contact with the virus to the beginning of symptoms is generally about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although mild symptoms are common in most cases, in some cases its progress can lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organs failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through small spit particles, often caused by coughing, sneezing or speaking during close contact.
When spit particles are produced during respiration, they usually fall on the ground or on the surface rather than spread long distances.
People can also be infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms beginning, although it is likely to spread before symptoms are revealed and afterwards of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by Real-Time Reversetranscribing Polymerase Chain Reaction (RRT-PCR).
Those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to use masks.
The recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending them against them, some suggesting them, and others requiring them.
Currently there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local infection has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Infected with the virus may be symptomatic or may have symptoms like flu, such as fever, coughing, exhaustion, and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, continuous chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty in waking up, and bluishness of the mouth or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical care is recommended.
Less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nose-watering, or throat pain may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea have been found with percentage variations.
Some infected in China were initially diagnosed with chest pressure and chest palpitation.
In some cases the disease may lead to pneumonia, multi-organic disability, and death.
This is called the initial stage of the bacteria.
The initial stage of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms will have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of the non-symptomatic carriers in the infection is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may play a role in spreading the disease.
The ratio of infected persons who did not see symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Centers (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed infections were unsymptomatic while in the hospital.
On April 1, the National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomatic cases among its daily infections; on that day, 130 (78%) of 166 infected cases were symptomatic during the test.
Both spit and saliva can carry more viruses.
If you speak louder than you normal, you get more spits out.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause small drops to spread up to .
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences indicated that bioarosole infection could be possible, and air collectors kept in the hallway outside the human home gave positive samples of viral RNA.
Several treatments such as intusion and cardiopalmonary revival (CPR) can cause respiratory emissions to become aerial particles and result in airborne spread.
While there is concern that the virus may spread through the feces, this risk is considered less. The virus is most contagious when symptoms appear in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms are clear, but the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not clear how the disease is easily transmitted, but one person usually infects two to three people, and the virus survives on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was detectable for one day on cardboard, in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and in 99% of copper for four hours.
It varies depending on moisture and temperature.
Soap and detergents can also be effective when used properly; Saban's products break down the virus's fatty protection layer, disable it, and release it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhoxidine gluconate (operational microbial disinfectants), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken between two days after hospitalization began.
Five of six patients had the highest virus sample on the first day and the sixth patient had the highest virus sample on the second day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first discovered from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of people with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in domestic soap, which explodes its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most influenced organ of COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through a large amount of enzyme Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) found in the lungs' Type II alveolar cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "Spike" (Peplomer) to connect to the feed cells."
In Chinese Wuhan, 12% of infected persons admitted to hospitals had severe cardiac injuries and it is more frequent in serious diseases.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory reactions and immune system disorders during development of the disease, but severe myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors move fast to the heart and engage in heart activity.
Thrombosis (31%) and Venus thromboambolism (25%) have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to weak prognosis. Dead bodies of people with COVID-19 have shown dispersed alveolar (different alveolar damages, DAD), and lymphocytes with inflammatory infiltrait.
Although SARS-COV-2 tend to move to the epithelial cell -ACE2 connecting the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be related to inflammatory IL-6-secreted monocytes and serious lung pathology recruitments.
Corpse tests indicate lymphocytic infiltrat.
The WHO has released several test protocols for the disease.
The ideal method of testing uses real-time reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in respiratory samples obtained by nezophrenial swabs; however, samples of nasal swabs or saliva may also be used.
The results are generally available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but these require two blood samples at a time of two weeks and the results have a low immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to separate the coronavirus strains and reveal genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could develop independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infection and detect whether a person was infected in the past) were in preparation for development, but not yet widely used.
Chinese experience in the tests only showed 60 to 70% accuracy.
On March 21, 2020, the FDA approved the first local care test for use late that month. The diagnosis guide published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommends methods of detection based on diagnostic properties and epidemic-related risks.
Two-sided, multilobar ground-glass opecphycity with a vertical, symmetric and backward distribution is common in primary infection.
Subplioral predominance, irregular paving (lobular septal thickening by filling up movable alveolar) and amalgamation can be seen according to the development of the disease.
Little information is available about pathophysiology and microscopic wounds of COVID-19.
The key pathological information in the autopsy are:
Macroscope: pulurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary shooth
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary epidema, numocyte hyperplasia, large-scale atipical numocytes, lymphocytic infestation and multinucleated giant cell formation
Serious pneumonia: damaged sporadic alveolar (DAD) with sporadic alveolar emissions.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Cure pneumonia: Organization of extracts in the alveolar cavity and lung interstitial fibrosis
Blood: spread intravascular congeal (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include sitting at home, avoiding populated places, washing hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds and practicing proper respiratory hygiene for at least 20 seconds, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CCDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and use the inner part of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CCDC has advised use of facial covering in public to partially restrict infection by individuals without symptoms. Social distance strategies are designed to reduce the contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
Instructions to keep a distance include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
"There is no known medicine that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until 2021, the main part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve."
The CCDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are visiblely dirty, before eating, and after blowing, coughing, or sneezing.
It further recommends use of alcohol-based hand sanitary with at least 60% alcohol when not available. In places where commercial hand sanitary is not available, the WHO provides two formats for local production.
In these preparations, the activity of antimicrobial is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humacant.
Humans are driven by assistance care, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen assistance, and other affected serious organs.
The CCDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear ordinary masks.
Extracurricular membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and food have been recommended to improve immune systems.
Aided treatment may be effective for people with minimal symptoms at the early stage of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for those infected with COVID-19 in hospitalization.
In the United States, intensiveists and pulmonologists have organized medical recommendations from various organizations, the free resources, IBCC.
There is no specific treatment for COVID-19 until April 2020.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for primary use.
Warning must be taken to reduce the risk of virus infection, especially in healthcare environments when methods such as intusion or hand ventilation are performed that can produce airborne cells.
For healthcare professionals serving people affected by COVID-19, the CCDC suggests that in addition to using evidence alerts, touch alerts, and airborne alerts, the person should be kept in an airborne infection Isolation Room, AIIR. The CCDC has described instructions to use personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Proposed tools include: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for the industrial environment but FDA has approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but are not guaranteed for specific uses by labels of effectiveness against certain biological elements.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using homemade masks as a face covering or a last resort.
Most patients do not have sufficient COVID-19 seriousness for the need of mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some patients do.
The type of respiratory assistance for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people with some evidence that high flow nasal canula or by-level positive airway pressure can avoid intusion.
Whether either of these will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high flow net tubes. Serious cases are most common in older adults (who are over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, limiting health management's ability to deal with the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that are sufficiently serious to be hospitalized.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people in hospitals affected by COVID-19 eventually entered the ICU.
In COVID-19, acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) develops, and mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
To maximize oxygen distribution, pressure control modes and high PEEP capable ventilators are required, while ventilators require reducing the risk of lung injuries and nemothorax.
High levels of PEEP may not be found in old ventilators.
Possible treatment research began in January 2020 and several diagnostic tests of antiviral drugs are underway.
Remedyv seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021, several drugs that are under test are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced tests.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with serious diseases.
The WHO proposed volunteers will participate in a trial of the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA has temporarily approved conveyance plasma as a trial treatment where the person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
The necessary diagnostic studies were not done to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to write their names and ID numbers.
The app is able to use surveillance data to detect potential risks of "near contact" and eventually infection.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-control when potential risks are detected, it also warns local health officials. Big Data Analytics, facial detection technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor infected people and people in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Egyptian government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of individuals who were suspected of contracting the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect individuals who might be in contact with infected citizens and to enforce quarantine.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telecom also distributed integrated phone locations data to the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency to prevent the spread of the virus and to do research.
Russia has used facial identification technology to identify quarantine violators.
"Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galera said mobile phone operators informed him that "40% of the people are walking anyway."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42.000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus worldwide.
Individuals may feel ill from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
"BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, emotional stress and economic recession are a perfect catastrophe to damage human mental health and health."
Like other common upper respiratory diseases such as common cold, this disease may progress slowly or without any symptoms.
Small infections usually recover within two weeks, but severe or severe infections may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a risk of serious infection with COVID-19, but there is a lack of information on COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia and damage the lungs.
Among the majority of seriously infected, COVID-19 can rapidly increase acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS), which can cause respiratory disorders, septic shock, or multi-organic disorders.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting and loss of heart, kidney, and liver.
Among those admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, 6% of the patients with COVID-19 have been detected with an abnormal blood pressure, especially an increase in prothrombin time, while abnormal kidney activity has been found in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have liver enzymes increased (transaminesis).
According to the same report, the time between the outbreak of symptoms and death, including five hospitalized, was ten days.
However, there was a seven-day interval between hospitalization and death of patients transferred to the ICU.
In one survey of early infected cases, the period between early symptoms appearing and death, with a period of six to 41 days, was 14 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of the pulmonary sample autopsy showed the damage of alviolla spread with cellular fibromyxoids emerging in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the numosite.
The image of the lungs is similar to the syndrome of acute respiratory disorder (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, cardiac arrest or troponin levels were diagnosed with heart damage.
According to the U.S. March data, 89% of those admitted to the hospital had presence of the disease. Economic conditions in a region and availability of medical resources can also affect the mortality rate.
The death rate from this disease varies not only due to regional differences but also due to methodological difficulties.
Limited counting of mild infections can cause excessive death rate.
The fact, though, is that death is the result of past infections, meaning that the current mortality rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have serious symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die. Concerns have been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital authorities reported a decrease in lung capacity between 20% and 30% in some recovered from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
The possibility of immunity is high based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in those cases, healing from COVID-19 has been reported after the later positive test results of the coronavirus.
These incidents are feared to be due to a deterioration of permanent infection rather than reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has an animal source, through spillover infection.
The original source is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely manipulated by human-to-human infection.
A survey of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, indicated the first date of symptoms beginning as 1 December 2019.
The early introduction of symptoms was reported by official publications from the WHO on December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to determine the amount of death.
These numbers vary according to region, and are affected by population characteristics such as the amount of testing, quality of healthcare systems, alternatives to medical treatment, time spent since the early outbreak, and age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO specified deaths due to a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as the ICD-10 disease code U07.1, while deaths due to a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as a medical or epidemically diagnosed COVID-19 as the U07.2 code. Death-to-case ratio (death-to-case ratio)
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death and infection ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which identifies the percentage of those diagnosed who died of the disease, and infection fatality rate (Infection fatality rate, IFR), which identifies the percentage of those diagnosed and not diagnosed who died of the disease.
These statistics do not have a specific timeline and follow specific populations from infection to diagnosis.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy is Casiglion Diadda, a small village of 4,600 people, where 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelte, the disease spread through the Carnival festival and among the young, causing relatively few deaths, and all COVID-19 deaths may not be officially classified.
Furthermore, the German health system was not devastated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of blood donors may have antibodies, according to the evaluation.
69 people (0.04% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The effects of epidemics and its death rate vary from men to women.
In studies held in China and Italy, male death rate is higher.
The maximum risk for men is in their 50's, and the gap between men and women ends in their 90's.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8 percent of males and 1.7 percent of females.
The exact causes of this gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, the prevalence of smoking among women is relatively low, and the development of co-diabetes in men at a younger age, such as high blood pressure may play a role in higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men, and 72% of those who died in COVID-19  were men.
Since April 2020, the U.S. government has not been monitoring data related to gender infections of COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral illnesses such as Ebola, HIV, Influenza and SARS affect men and women separately.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to be in contact with the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The head of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means Corona, V is the virus, D is the disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to specific geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species or human groups, in harmony with international recommendations for naming to prevent blemish. The virus that caused COVID-19 is called Civil Acute Respiratory Syndrome Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO uses additional "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus responsible for public connection."
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronvirus".
"While the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were generally referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-NCoV and 2019-NCoV as temporary names for acute respiratory diseases as per the 2015 guidelines in view of the use of virus and disease locations.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the power limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials such as nezal swabs and parts of ventilators.
In one example, when a Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve very urgently, the supplier was unable to provide it within the time required, a local new company examined the manufacturer's product and produced overnight 100 valves required.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and rumors about the origin, level, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread quickly online.
It is believed that humans are capable of transmitting viruses to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of copies of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for treatment of this disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a reciprocal support test to assess the effects of treatment of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest commitment to effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but various organizations are actively producing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptor to access human cells.
Three vaccination techniques are being investigated.
First, researchers aim to produce a complete virus vaccine.
Whether inactive or dead, the purpose of the use of the virus is to extract the immediate immune response of the human body to a new infection by COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to produce a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system in a particular subunit of the virus.
In case of SARS-CoV-2, the study targeted the S-spike protein that allows the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme container.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel strategy for the development of vaccines).
Experimental vaccines must be tested from one of these strategies for protection and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first diagnostic trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains genetic code that does not cause harm from the virus that causes the disease. Increase in antibodies has been indicated as a possible challenge to developing the vaccine of SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active diagnosis trials have been underway since April 2020.
Seven experiments were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being done to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine Phase III tests on Remdecivir across different countries are supposed to be reported in late April.
A dynamic review of the diagnostic development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19 include Remdecivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Lopenavir/Ritonavir and Lopenavir/Ritonavir combination of Interferon be
There is test evidence of effectiveness by Remdesive in March 2020.
Physiological improvements have been observed in patients treated using the experimental drug Remdeciv.
Phase III diagnostic trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Cloroquine, formerly used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, when the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends one grade of drugs per day, it found that twice that amount could be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency approval for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the basis of the consideration of doctors treating those infected with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also include interferon, rhibavirin, or umichanovir in context of COVID-19.
Initial information suggests that ribavirin requires high drug levels to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further Vivo studies after showing low density prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have proved that preparing the primary spik protein by transmembrane protein serin 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azythromycin, has serious limitations that prevent the medical community from accepting these therapies without further study. Ocelatamiv does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro and has no known role in treating COVID-19.
Cytocine disasters can be complicated after serious COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has a rapid release-resistant property. After completing a small study, Tosilizumab has been included in the Chinese National Health Commission's Medical Guidelines.
After seeing positive results in people with serious disease, it is undergoing a Phase 2 indiscriminate test at the national level in Italy.
Blood testing combined with serum ferritin to identify cytocine disease means preventing the increase of the disease, which is believed to be the cause of death for some infected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy was approved by the Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist FDA on the basis of past-related case studies for treatment of steroids refractory cytocine release syndrome induced by a different cause.
To this day, there is no inherent, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is effective treatment for CRS.
Refined and thick antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being explored as a vaccine-free method of inactive vaccines given to those who need them.
This technique was experimented for SARS with unresolved results.
Viral deactivation is an expected process through which passive antibodies therapy can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as cellular cytotoxicity based on antibodies and/or fagocytosis may be possible.
Other varieties of inactive antibodies therapy, for example, are on the way to develop the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of blood fluids taken from recovered patients, and this virus can be extended to specific antibodies for rapid organization.
