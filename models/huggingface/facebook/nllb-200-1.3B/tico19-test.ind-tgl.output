Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, although the stages vary by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date shows that approximately 80% of COVID-19 patients develop mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with the majority of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe illness and requires hospital treatment, while in another 6% cases it develops into a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom and compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

In Eurosurveillance 2020 issue 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with a confirmed COVID-19 case based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases

This data is used to assess the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK, and compare them to trends in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we counted the cumulative incidents over the past 14 days, so taking into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, in the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the cases in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and UK
The 14-day cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (Thailand) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and UK as a whole, cumulative COVID-19 incidence started rising around 21 February, and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar trend of increasing cumulative COVID-19 incidences.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of 15 March at 08:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggests that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the differences in the stages experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.

currently, data on COVID-19 admissions in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are available for only 6% and 1% respectively (data not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
The study, which was conducted in 2010-2011, showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and nursing care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and medical care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modelling scenario related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimated prevalence of inpatient COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA country and UK associated with a risk of >90% exceeding intensive care bed capacity, is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
As cases are so far clustered in specific regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a specific regional service coverage population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of Area Unit Designation for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is expanding very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As shown in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from containment approach to mitigation approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the appropriate response if it is not implemented sooner.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity when countries have the possibility to further enhance their control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disaster for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
COVID-19 nonetheless has lower severity and mortality rates than SARS, but is more contagious and affects older people more than younger people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this newly emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing research subject.
We'll cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.

WHO warns that COVID-19 is the #1 public enemy and has the potential to do more damage than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established virus sequences isolated from multiple patients, over 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in this rapidly developing new subject area.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other disease caused by CoVs, namely Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered but urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered to be nonlethal pathogens for humans, primarily causing about 15% of colds.
Though, in this century, we've found highly pathogenic CoVs to humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing outbreaks that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with horrific morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19
As shown in Figure 1.1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.

Then the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a healthcare provider infection was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission might occur.
On January 23, a regional quarantine was imposed in Wuhan city and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak as a global health emergency.

Because the situation is developing so rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.

SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the people infected were over 50 years old, only a few were under 20 years old, and only 14 people infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to infect males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is spreading in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from conception to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the corresponding R0 is 2.23-4.82.

Mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the ad hoc mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large subfamily of viruses containing single-stranded sense RNA.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The spike (S) envelope glycoprotein binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and dipoptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA is joined by the envelope glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein to form a virion-containing vesicle, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity among the 10 samples that were sampled; the samples were taken from the outbreak's origin location, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.

ACE2 in humans was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is also known to cause infections in humans.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b and proteins secreted by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 protein orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human ACE2 cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has both open and closed conformations, is composed of dimers and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which are evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are respectively transmitted to humans via foxes and camels.

Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans which involves homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the common ant-eating long-nosed mammal in traditional Chinese medicine, may be a SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host based on 99% genetic homology to CoVs found in the ant-nosed and SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2s physicochemical properties are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, acetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively inactivated the virus.
Total human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In general, once invading a host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV may help the virus evade the immune response.
Soon after, the adaptive immune response joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play a vital role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis, however.
Immunity humoral, which includes complementes, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction produces a large number of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, complex organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a chronic cluster, is more prevalent in elderly with co-morbidity and pregnant women.
Typically, people who are exposed to a large amount of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of being infected than others.
SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated average incubation period of 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
The more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent people who are infected, but without symptoms, from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to the virus or are infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after onset of illness.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who have fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging disorders, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies as of late December 2019 showed that the symptom percentage was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, namely studies in family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
80% of patients require ventilation support, however, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were indicated as the primary symptoms and ventilation support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 reached an R0 of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas SARS-CoV's R0 ranged only from 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 is compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
The figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread rate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not kill MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

Cluster seals are often found in a single family or from a single group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.

In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell (especially lymphocyte) counts.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes a lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The level of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in the blood of some patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood clotting rate increased in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, are elevated, and the lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
Photochorotic dysfunction is found in a large proportion of COVID-19 patients and is characterized by bilateral hazy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often have atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate the gas exchange disorder.
Type I and type II pneumocytosis decreases surfactant levels and increases surface pressure thereby decreasing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the worst findings in thoracic photography often parallel the most severe disease rates.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocytosis, formation of the hyaline membrane, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as numerous nucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Similar situations occur in the diagnosis of SARS.

On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dipping stick in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
e verified in clinical samples, we'll see that this new technique can greatly improve the sensitivity and ease of use.

Therapies include current and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.

Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
epi, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the major threats to patients and the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart failure or respiratory failure.

Immunity overreaction is known to cause cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals which are the major causes of ARDS and complex organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine 4 signal suppression; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in high doses are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affect prognosis.
However, short-term administration of low-dose corticosteroids is recommended to be given with caution to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single-stranded RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicinal products used by patients should be monitored closely.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody manufacturing
There is a long history of collecting the blood of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
True, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who were seriously ill.
their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to propose such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.

For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and large quantities of plasma are needed to treat critically ill patients.
Developing and producing specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult.
o,ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.
The effects depend largely on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combination.

For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rates (13%).
though this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, have to be included in the evaluation.

They found that the time needed for body temperature to recover, symptom relief, and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
The majority of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel very fearful of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely, and angry.

In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disturbances, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even schizophrenia have been reported.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspicious persons, and persons in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

For SARS, a live-debilitating vaccine has been evaluated in experimental animals.
The in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the elderly and in lethal challenge models and its protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before clinical studies are initiated.
This is probably because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
The MERS cluster continues to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.

The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
The development of disease prognosis models is therefore crucial for healthcare organisations to prioritise their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 was found to be prevalent in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of patients being over 50 years old in the 8,866 case study described above.
Patients requiring intensive care tend to have participant comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients not requiring intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which hints at age as a prognostic factor for the end outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care have a greater chance of having acute heart injury and arrhythmias.
Cardiovascular events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to bind to ACE2-positive colangiocytes, which may result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It's important to note that age and underlying disease are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Primary clinical symptoms:Torax photography and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the end result and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as supportive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and short durations in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients suffered from extreme stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of replicating in the lower respiratory tract and causing mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Thus, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulties in controlling epidemics.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to occur when patients are severely ill and most do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.


The most optimistic estimates state that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-knuckle and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and returned from hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicates that the re-identified virus may be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.

Ebola was originally predicted to cause a million cases and half the deaths.
,,,,.......
It is also possible that, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, thus raising the possibility of a new transmission, feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosokomial infection, which included 17 patients with other pre-existing illnesses and 40 health care providers.

The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirators (serial number 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep saliva from potentially infected people from being trapped in the air or sticking to the surface of the material, where the saliva can be passed on to others.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, , , , , , ,
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, healthcare providers who come in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
Besides masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation cloaks to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruss can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammation of the eye.


Two feet is believed to be appropriate to keep patients away.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.

This message has been very calming to the public, especially as the whole country is preparing for the Spring Festival, so this critical time is overdue to contain the small-scale disease in Wuhan.
China's disease control agency should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, the agency should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic than to wait for an official report from the doctor or official; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain potential epidemics at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) issue more frequent and effective exercises to raise public awareness about the disease epidemic and periodically test and improve community response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus which started spreading in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and over 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this review.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has the impression of a recurrent SARS outbreak.

COVID-19 is more prevalent in older people than in young people and more prevalent in men than in women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS was higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are severely ill. This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains part of the reason why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A routine RNA test to check for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can test positive for the virus again.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although we found 96% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we still couldn't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal species is the intermediate for transmitting the virus from the original host, say, the bat, to humans?
without knowing answers 1 and 2, we cannot interrupt the transmission effectively and the plague can re-spread at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical origins suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Do these viruses also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does a virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Do you think it's going to be a global pandemic, ending like SARS, or recurring periodically like the flu?

ever, however, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its host, including humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the tide and revealed how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than its sibling, SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are zoonotic, so understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs is beneficial to us.
Most HCoVs originate in bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir host of some HCoVs has also been identified.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
Investigation of host-CoV interactions in animals may also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast these HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genome recombination.
The current 2019 (COVID-19) CoV disease epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transition and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, positive-stranded, single-stranded RNA viruses.
It has the largest genome at 26 to 32 kilobase among RNA viruses, which is called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Based on their structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar sequencing.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes the bulge or spike (S), the sheath or envelope (E), the membrane (M), and the nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins that are specific to specific lineages are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.

Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 typically cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the ingus of a cold-stricken patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, it has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating outbreaks in modern history, infecting over 8,000 people with a crude mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a sustained epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to various other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has sounded and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, mice, or pets.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces, and limiting factors of interspecies migration.
The study may also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediates, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which have important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
We specifically highlighted and discussed the general topic that the HCoV parent virus is normally nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trends of HCoVs that increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
HCoV-229E was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which was subsequently adapted for growth in the WI-38 lung cell line.
The HCoV-229E-infected patients exhibited cold symptoms, which included headache, sneezing, lameness, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10~20% of cases.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears similar to infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogen infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widespread worldwide and tend to be most transmitted during the winter in temperate regions.
Typically, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by a sickness period of about 2 weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems showed lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoV-infected patients initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, laziness, and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough, and shortness of breath as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage have also been observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
Besides the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys may also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weak immunity.
Virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy
Since then, a huge effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, the elderly, and the mentally debilitated patients who suffered from respiratory diseases.
Choriasis, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal specimens of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and its peak occurrence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Besides community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.

MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.

Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
Over 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.

In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and has named the disease COVID-19.

It should be noted that the case fatality in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the case fatality outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a pattern of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower in pathogenicity, but more infectious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in asymptomatic subjects and may have played a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.

First, the incubation period and duration of the HCoV disease journey are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four other HCoV communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general picture seen in Community HCoV infection, which includes a picture of mild nonspecific symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe COVID-19 cases may look like SARS-CoV infection although at a slightly lower ratio.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities to both community HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the decline in the transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2 after several pathways in humans still needs to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from fecal samples.
"e the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it has yet to be clarified by further studies".
The issue of whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoVs is also very important to know.
The outline of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and sustained spread in multiple pathways in humans, will greatly influence the eventual fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.

In other words, both HCoVs and humans may be the species that survived the primitive HCoV pandemic.
The HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans who experience severe HCoV disease have been destroyed.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations to fight host restriction factors.
As such, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs have circulated in the human population and triggered colds in immunocompetent individuals.
The virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs have not yet adapted to humans and their transmission in humans is untenable.
Both must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar profile to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is as transmissible as the community HCoV, at least for now.
SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoVs and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without reservoir animal hosts or intermediates.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, we need to discuss the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifier definitions and characteristics of HCoVs.
Animalia act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have a closely related ancestor and share high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host carries HCoVs continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for the HCoV or the parent virus.
If HCoVs are new to an intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifier host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become deadly if they cannot sustain transmission in an intermediate host.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemisity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that zero SARS cases have had a history of contact with game animals.
The study also found that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG was higher in the general population.
The moon fox (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in the live animal market were the first to be identified as carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the foxes in the market were killed.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be excluded that possibly many small mammal species also serve as intermediate SARS-CoV amplifier hosts.
All these hosts seem to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV further revealed a closely related bat CoV, called Rhinolopus bat CoV-SARS relative HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese stallion bats.
The bat tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts for emerging human pathogens.

Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from bat feces samples was shown to use ACE2 from bats, foxes, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
WIV1 represents the closest-related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high level of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the virus's entry route.
The RNA polymerase-dependent RNA sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to its matching in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.

MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.

On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that Arab camels gave seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, similar to camels from the Middle East in some African countries.
Live MERS-CoVs identical to the virus found in humans were isolated from the nasal swab of the Arabian camel, further indicating that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms was observed in the test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus from bats.

SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the direct reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless a near-identical bat CoV is discovered later.

Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of endangered small mammals, known as the tringlings (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestral beta-CoV that is related to SARS-CoV-2.
The new alligator CoV genome shares 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.

Both are grouped into two sub-lines - the SARS-CoV-2-like virus lineage in the phylogenetic tree, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Significantly, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much more distinct, although the degree of homology of whole genome sequences is higher.
Previous studies in sick pangolins also reported the detection of contig virus from lung samples, which turned out to be also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different compilation methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of approximately 86.3% of the complete virus genome.
We can't rule out the possibility of a gull being one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from quail due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV relatives of quail-SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, crustaceans, and other mammals has yet to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 tern, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest sequence homology at genome-wide levels.
It is too speculative to say that the high degree of similarity between the RBD beta-CoVs of the SARS-CoV-2 tick and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The comparative hypothesis supports a recombination between the beta-CoVs of the SARS-CoV-2 relatives of the tick and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driver, recombination is prevalent among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have yet to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in three-colored North American bats showed close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with the Camelidae also suspected to be its intermediate host.
To be clear, current knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.


The history of HCoV-229E's interspecies transmission is not very clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs that are related to HCoV-229E have been found.
In between, there is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, might be in contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoVs cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpaca alpha-CoV is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Another possibility is that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as the HCoV-229E gene loops, alpacas and Arabian camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the initial identification of the virus and was also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It's clear that bats are a rich breeding ground for virus species for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, a tightly-knit colony, close social interaction, and strong flight abilities are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal 'virus spreaders'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabian camel for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from an intermediate host to a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoVs as their transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the camel role in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the gull, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV of the tilapia is highly pathogenic in tilapia.
The moose may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV, similar to foxes in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be considered or excluded.
First, bats could be a reservoir host for the SARS-CoV-2 related virus which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, the eel may have been one of the intermediate amplifier hosts for the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 relatives.

It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 recombination and adaptation may occur in a third species that comes into contact with both bats and crustaceans.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
CoVs have corrective exoribonuclease, elimination which results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.

Additionally, the mutation rate is often high when the CoV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoVs which have a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is actually lower, suggesting a higher degree of adaptation with humans.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Teoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs provides extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frame and protein functions that are encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique select-salin mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing vessels, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
                                                                                                                                                   
Besides the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the occurrence of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human and fox isolates of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is suspected to undergo rapid adaptation in a variety of hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensively targets the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its coreceptors as a route of entry into the virus.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, foxes, mice, and raccoons, thus allowing for interspecies virus transmission.
actually only 6 different amino acid residues are observed between human and fox virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located in receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV fox possesses K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the bulk protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the binding affinity of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein to be 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to know if there are other coreceptors that may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part in S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-terasethylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans following interspecies transmission from its animal host.
Besides cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also governed by other host dependence and restriction factors.
This host protein difference between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over host dependence factors and break through host restriction factors in order to be successful in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in this important virus-host interaction field have yet to be identified and characterized.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to the beginning of the outbreak
Bat CoV diversity provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs function as the HCoV gene locus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein-replacing gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because isolated SARS-CoV-CoV relatives were found to encode a wide variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic of 29 nucleotide deletions was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the occurrence of recombination between different lineages was shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs have recombinated with other animal CoVs in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of the virus from the selection stress it experiences, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Lastly, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressures in their reservoir hosts.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It appears that bats adapt well to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activation of proinflammatory response in bats would reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs efficiently.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to increased regulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptor and low levels of expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex molecule.

The more pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
CoVs replicate vigorously without triggering a strong host immune response.
THE COURT: Here lies the secret to having an asymptomatic carrier and causing severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response as well as cytokine storms, with lung damage becoming more severe if the immune response becomes stronger.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been independent of CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the correlation of immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
For this reason, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 may be useful in the management of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 followed the general trend of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have dramatically changed our perceptions of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans via crustaceans and other mammals has yet to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabian camel for a long time.

Arabian camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eradicate this virus, a new genotype might emerge and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, the bat CoVs that are potentially zoonotic are very diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or more lethal to humans in the future.

With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and management plans must be implemented.

The viruses are in their natural reservoir until there is a chance for spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are instructed to stay away from wild animals.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to keep away from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of zoonotic viruses.
Some pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, the conditions when bats and pangolins share ecological niches are important to know.
Second,if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans,how humans contact bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intermediate host, the way that mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and penguins, should be explained.
Finally, as many mammals, including pets may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be undertaken.

In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is now formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted much attention since its publication.

Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who introduced a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
their work added new evidence to our guide and became a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.

According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case it is necessary to combine one of the epidemiological history descriptions with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to meet three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with clusters of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in a small area, such as a home, office, school classroom, etc.).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with either of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole virus genome sequence showing high homogeneity for the new known coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM specific antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or change of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies from positive to negative, or titer increased ≥4 fold at recovery phase above the rate at acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
The modification is based on the researchers' ongoing research to find optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood collection, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of positive results of certain antibodies into the confirmed criteria.

Zhou et al. need to update their flow chart because they classify people without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future practice and clinical studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of both suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend following and adhering to the latest guidance in your respective countries.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest daily death rate
Tasi, BangladeshkakonfirmasttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttTT
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.

17 people died.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases are between 51 and 60 years old, and one case is between 41-50 years old.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.




transportation of basic goods - medicines, fuel, and food - is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.

SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed one million worldwide

At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred on the same day as Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from coronavirus infection.


CBS News reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there have been over 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronavirus infection.



The Portuguese parliament held a vote to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one abstention.

Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay at home order
Australia: Retailers lower their toilet paper purchase limit

ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit, on Monday.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
This change follows the four-pack per transaction restriction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles respectively on 4 and 5 March.

"Shocked" sales last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Canberra's Costco also limited the allowed quantity to two packs last week.
To avoid shortages, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of shipments, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local government agency restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult.
He anticipates rising production costs, as suppliers struggle to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.


He stresses that toilet paper is a bulk product that is low in supply and, when sold, creates a lot of empty space on shelves that makes shortages even more noticeable.
Coles and Woolworths argue that if there are lots of items on the shelf, if products like toiletries and sanitizers can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, panic may be minimized, says Russel Zimmerman via ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap?
Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex Toilet Tissues, and Solaris Paper, maker of Sorbent, stress they work 24/7 to keep supplies, according to a report by News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some property sellers are offering free towels to the first bidders of an auction in Melbourne, at a time when fewer auctions are held as buyers take a break for the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin-based daily, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toiletries.
Shops are actually reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, saying that they do not plan to impose any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, hand soap, and flour.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

We are very concerned both by the alarming rate of spread and severity and by the alarming rate of slowing down of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in a note published by CNN in February that "other than influenza, no respiratory virus has ever been traced from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus".
" And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows a decision by WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "Basically, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.

The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

364,000 have been cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected of being infected.

The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponements or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and widespread shortages of supplies compounded by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.

As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.


The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to the bat coronavirus, the tenggerin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.

On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case traceable to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, was likely the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.

Case refers to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.

A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections went undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than the reported cases.
The baseline estimate of reproduction rate (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are cured.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The actual fatality rate from COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures probably do not include people who die without being tested, for example, at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculations by a factor of 4-5 times.

The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.

As of 13 March, over forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
The death rate varies by region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-case mortality ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptom onset 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom onset after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
Tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Academics have tried to calculate these figures for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper bound of this estimated range is consistent with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO has confirmed that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end of the duration of this outbreak is unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni, of Penn State University, states: "Without control, an infectious disease usually fades and then begins to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
"However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this time as to when it will happen".

On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to one or two years".
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraint and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University, said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's so transmissible, could disappear completely" and that the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, that comes back every year".
The virulence of the repeats will depend upon the immunity of the group and the mutation rate.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, depressed chest or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bluishness of the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers suggest that those who are in close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and screened to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio to range from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) typically ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, estimates of the number of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell initially fell by 30%, then to 15%.
Details of how the disease spreads are still being studied.
COVID-19 is believed to be spread primarily by close contact and through tiny droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered coughing can cause droplet to push 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some researchers speculate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that linger longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when exhaling, including when speaking, although these viruses are not generally transmitted through the air.
The droplet may fall into the mouth or nose of a person nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions to be converted into aerosols and then dispersed through the air.

Though there are concerns that the virus could spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fecal-oral means. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms are apparent and at later stages of the disease.
The person tested positive for up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission may have occurred before significant symptoms.
Only a few asymptomatic cases have been reported as laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others. The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and for over four hours on copper.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two bat-derived strains.
The virus has 96% similarity at the genome-wide level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the tengleback virus and the human virus.

Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually made via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or by CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, which was first circulated on 17 January.
Testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is performed.
Testing can be done on a breath sample or blood sample.
Results are generally available within hours to days.
The test is usually performed on the nasopharynx, but throat swabs can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have been shown to be accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) in symptomatic persons include asymmetrical peripheral glass ground opacity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenoviruses, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is so faster and more sensitive that it is recommended to consider it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
AI-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging features of viruses with X-rays and CT scans.

It is recommended that surgical masks be worn in public places by people who may already be infected.

though, the virus has reached the stage of community-scale spread in most parts of the world.

CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands appear dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
The reason for this is that, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap which destroys its protective coating.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% by volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
1%, isopropanol 50100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.27.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case in a public facility, such as an office or child care center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the patient, should be disinfected.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with curved elbows or use a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discard the tissue.
Masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and range of exhalation droplets that are spread when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face with unsanitary hands, which is a major source of transmission".Masks are also recommended for people who care for others who may have the disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people caring for COVID-19 patients, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks in the public.

Hong Kong recommends the wearing of surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.

The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit their citizens from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the barracks to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all its citizens to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, requires train and intercity bus passengers to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever outdoors, and has recommended that people who cannot afford a face mask should make their own.

Social restraint (also called physical restraint) is an infection control measure intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.


Today, many governments are imposing or calling for social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people to gather recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, from 250 people (if there is no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The use of the term "social restraint" suggests that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
The recommendations include encouragement to have sex only with someone who lives with you and does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.

The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for people who belong to high-risk groups.

The strategy in outbreak control is containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of disease, the next step is to move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce the impact on health care systems and communities.
The combination of containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction rate to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of infectious disease is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as bending the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading healthcare and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions to manage the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restriction, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic measures aimed at curbing the outbreak are being taken in China as the severity of the outbreak becomes more apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel restrictions.

South Korea introduced mass filtering and local quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to infected individuals who self-quarantine and imposes heavy fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan is ramping up production of face masks and penalizing accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the US show that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) have major challenges.
optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak health care demands by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression is selective, but must be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is achieved first), otherwise transmission will bounce back rapidly as suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to curb pandemics have had a social and economic impact.
No specific antiviral drug has been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medication, drinking enough water, and resting may help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use may worsen the patient's condition.
Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that capacity building and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in the response to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, where possible canceling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and enhancing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".

Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public announcement on 31 December and informed WHO.

In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and as Wuhan is a major transportation hub and rail transit point.
On January 20, China reported almost 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.

About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and create border controls.
The national response included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-at-place orders, or regional quarantines) and overnight curfews.
26 Março, 1.7 biliões de pessoas no mundo estavam em quarentena regional, que aumentou para 2.6 biliões de pessoas dois dias depois, que é cerca de um terço da população mundial.

WHO notes the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up so as to hinder prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "giving regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared because of the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not have adequate health systems.

On February 5, WHO urged the global community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus if an outbreak spreads".
Tedros further stated that "the limit of our power is at the weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later".In a press conference on February 11, WHO set COVID-19 as the name of the disease for the virus.

Then, the UN activated the Crisis Management Team to enable the coordination of the entire UN response, which according to WHO would allow them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to address the impact of the epidemic in the broader social, economic, and developmental spheres".

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibody testing shows the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
The accurate disease mortality and immunity levels of groups in the population can be determined from the results of this test.


This variability may also significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples.
Typically, results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on strep throat are reliable only in the first week of disease.
Then, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, sample material may be taken from the deep airway using a suction catheter or material removed through coughing (sputum) may be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed testing on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinically valid PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.

One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit gave unconvincing results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing nationally.
Likewise, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions are announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that can be done in 3.5 hours with high volumes so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for testing which took approximately 45 minutes.
FDA has approved testing using non-PCR isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.
Because it does not require a series of temperature change cycles, this method can give a positive result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.

A review of the literature published in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic imaging has little diagnostic value at an early stage, as CT [computed tomography] findings may have been present before the onset of symptoms".

Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the current pandemic onset showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19". In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as about 7 days after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
The high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this testing, but their availability will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although a series of specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single peripheral blood specimen obtained through a skin puncture is generally used.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction steps are not required prior to testing.

The test capacity is up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR testing for viral RNA.
In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme to allow suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a specimen tube", they spit in it, send it back, and get the test results a short while later. NHS UK announced that the NHS is pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home so as to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they come to hospital or have to disinfect the ambulance if used. In a land-based test for suspected COVID-19 cases, a health professional will take samples using appropriate precautionary measures.
The testing center has helped South Korea perform the fastest and most extensive testing of any country. On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany has a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient system and 10,700 tests had been performed in the previous week.
The cost is covered by the health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a land test was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany is unknown as only positive results have been reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000 square meter emergency detection laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火眼, or "Mata Api" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process over 10,000 samples per day.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modelling showed that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity was not available.
Wuhan lab was soon followed by Huo-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.

On the contrary, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
testing capacity, mostly in private sector labs, built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in their test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by private individuals.
The company explains that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to use the test equipment correctly.
The Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic has announced that it will withdraw the equipment that gives incorrect results, and replace it with other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.

The testing, which was followed by the quarantine of people who tested positive and the tracking of people who came into contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive end result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on a population of 3,400 people, approximately 10 days apart.
About half of the people who test positive have no symptoms, and all the cases that are found are quarantined.
With restrictions on travel to this community, new infections are eliminated completely.

Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time for the holiday on March 23.

one statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower case fatality rates, possibly because these countries were better able to detect people with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five COVID-19 positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
out of 16 reference labs, 7 are in asia, 5 are in europe, 2 are in africa, 1 is in north america, and 1 is in australia.
In the following chart, the column "% of test positive results" is influenced by the country's testing policy.

Lavar las manos, también conocido como higiene de las manos, es la práctica de limpiar las manos de una persona con el objetivo de eliminar la suciedad, el aceite, los microorganismos, u otras sustancias no deseadas.
"Critical" times throughout the day prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.

The five critical times of the day for hand washing with soap are: before and after defecating, after cleaning a child's ass or changing a diaper, before bathing a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.

Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a kid who just went to the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.

Washing your hands before giving medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Lavar las manos tiene muchos beneficios para la salud, incluyendo minimizar la propagación de la influenza, el coronavirus y otras enfermedades infecciosas; prevenir las causas de la diarrea contagiosa; reducir las infecciones respiratorias;


In developing countries, the mortality rates of children from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from the disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.

Pneumonia, the main ISPA, is the number one cause of infant death; it kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical measure, as well as reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary measures as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.

A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause an itchy and scaly skin condition, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too much washing hands is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of disease by the fecal-oral route, namely: before and after using the toilet (toilet, bowel movement), after cleaning the child's ass (changing diapers), before bathing the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.

The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate scale of action to support children's health and education.


The cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main job of soap and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase solubility.

Nevertheless, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by sufficient water flow.
Soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired from previous use.
The small number of studies that have examined bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transfer is unlikely to occur because bacteria are spoiled with foam.
The CDC nonetheless states that "liquid soaps that are removed from the container without the use of hands are preferred".
Antibakery soap is being promoted on a massive scale to the health conscious community.

Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Soapy warm water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that retain dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol-based hand scrubbers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubbers, antiseptic hand scrubbers, or hand sanitizers) began to be introduced.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickener such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or together with a humektan such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germicidal.
Scrubbing alcohol kills bacteria, including multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol-containing 70% alcohol disinfection kills 99.97% (log reduction 3.5, similar to reduction 35 decibels) bacteria in the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log reduction 4 to 5) bacteria in the hand 1 minute after use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type virus, the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis.Antifungal hand or alcohol scrubber in sufficient quantities should be used to moisten or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the hands and the sides and ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands instead of hand sanitizer, especially when hands look dirty.
The increased use of sanitizing agents is due to ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, sanitizing agents should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are available.
The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can often cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolines to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to alcohol-containing hand rubs are rare.
The lower incidence of causing contact dermatitis is disturbing to the attractiveness of this product compared to washing hands with soap and water.

This is why hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically, these products perform significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase rather than reduce the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if it comes in contact with water, the ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as alternatives to soap when soap is not available.

Wash your hands with hot or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because the boiled basin may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature seems to have no effect.
Wipes hands with plenty of soap, including the back of the hand, the fingertips, and the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly with soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rins thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry cloth or let it air dry.
Wet hands are more likely to re-infect, with areas that are often missed being the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and the area under the nails.
Nails and nail polish can store microorganisms.

Tipping taps are a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended by a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
A growing number of studies show that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper folding industry European Tissue Symposium, to compare the cleanliness levels of paper folding, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased on average 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the palm.
Trown with a jet air dryer causes an average 42% increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingertips and 15% in the palm.

The jet air dryer, which exhausted air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment by up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper-based dryers.

Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.

There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
one study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.

Because germs can survive in the water on your hands, wash them thoroughly and dry them with a clean cloth.
After drying, paper lap is used to turn off the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hand from re-contaminating the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in health care is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("spoilers") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet that shows hand washing and hand rubbing standards in the health care sector.
WHO's hand hygiene guidelines are also available on its website for public comment.
Relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Hours" for washing hands:
after exposure to blood/body fluid
before aseptic duty, and

To 'rub' hands before surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile cloth to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean the nail bed.
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 26 minutes.
Long scrubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back to the hand.
After washing, hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical robe is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling a sick person.
For hospital staphylococcal infection control, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands came from the first 20% of washing, and that the added benefit was very small when the frequency of cleaning hands was increased above 35%.

In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.

For example, in most rural areas in Africa, hand washing faucets near private or public toilets are rare, although there are options for making hand washing places affordable.
However, low levels of hand washing may also be due to ingrained habits and not to a lack of soap or water.

To run effectively, supervision and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of handwashing popularization in schools was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is met, the school can go from one star to eventually three stars.

Some studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or measurement of years lost to illness.
One study showed that promoting hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing" in England.
Back then, many people still believed that infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne and healthcare-associated infections made the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect oneself from the infectious disease.
"Handwashing techniques" posters, for example, hang next to handwashing sinks in public toilets as well as in office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
"Washing your hands of" means refusing to take responsibility for something or to participate in something.
The phrase comes from the Bible chapter in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used phrase in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins washing her hands continuously to clean up the imaginary stain; an act that shows her guilt for the crime she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been found that, after remembering or reflecting on unethical acts, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand washing devices more.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after the meditation had less chance to engage in compensatory "cleansing" actions, such as volunteering.

Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing after using the toilet.
Additionally, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after eating.

Taxonomy
The appropriate management of hazards in the workplace depends on the workplace and the work assignment, which is based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work-related contact with the public and other coworkers; for these jobs, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay in hospital if needed, respiratory ethics, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.

This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail orders.

OSHA considers healthcare and morgue personnel exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs an aerosol-producing procedure on, or takes or handles specimens from, a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for this worker includes the control of techniques, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 pandemic may have some impact on the workplace.
A worker may not show up for work because he is sick, needs to care for others, or fears possible exposure.
The pattern of trade can change, both in terms of the type of goods demanded and the way these goods are obtained (such as shopping outside rush hour, by delivery, or on-line).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The plan takes into account the level of risk associated with the various workplaces and work tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the household and community, as well as individual risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls needed to address such risks and the contingency plan for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparatory and management plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of epidemic control include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located influences the response taken.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Technical control involves isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures that requires action by the employer or employee.
Self-protective devices (SPCs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g. respirators), worn consistently and correctly, inspected, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering coughs and sneezing, providing tissue and trash containers, preparing for remote work or shift work with a gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and conducting routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are free from fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, and that sick leave policies should be flexible so that employees can stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees should be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, work at high risk of exposure includes work that requires close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with a person who is not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the location of the business, or because a person has recently travelled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.

Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick passengers or when touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly other personal protective equipment if sick passengers develop fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabins of isolated people.
If there is a minimal to moderate level of community transmission, social restraint strategies can be implemented, which include: cancelling field visits, gatherings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or dining in cafeterias, increasing table distance, gradual arrival and return times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high prevalence in the local community, in addition to social restraint strategies, extending school closures might be considered.

If close contact occurs during the arrest, the worker should clean and disinfect the belt and duty equipment before reuse using a household spray or cleaning cloth and follow standard operating procedures for controlling and disposing of used APDs as well as for controlling and washing dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain healthcare workers and morgues to be in the high or very high risk exposure category.

This work poses a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs aerosol-generating procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from, a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen collection.

Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
The specimen must be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filter mask respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes suitability testing, training, and medical examination.
WHO does not recommend full-face or coverall clothing as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people taking respiratory specimens, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, cloaks, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have for each other.
We've never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and building a global community, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we've seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and chats is a tremendous validation of the extraordinary human beings, who we've been fortunate enough to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to be able to call you all my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how powerful a symbol it is for this vital resource to remain available online for everyone.
your job is to make this happen, whether you're keeping this site running, helping pay our partners, or helping keep our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially today.
t is a moment when not just what we do, but how we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.

Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team-C met overnight to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We're eager to ease the pressure and support our mission for the long haul.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
To all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work schedule is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

We don't monitor your work hours.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
e shouldn't have to be said, but we do.

We've said it, and we'll say it again, to honor our commitment to our contractors and our hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working hours when things are normal.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
if you want to work, we support you.

"Working hard" can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, HR, Trust & Security operations, and Fundraising teams, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We'll begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is essential to our mission.
There's so much to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Today's slowdown is gonna be nothing for the future.
We don't plan to "work overtime to catch up" once this pandemic is over.
You wouldn't be expected to work overtime to meet today's unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the situation is changing and will endeavor to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan which allows for more time to budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self care, and caring for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with fewer schedules for the next few weeks.
Extending this timeline greatly reduces the workload and the current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We'll be presenting our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you team for your leadership in this.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
,,,,,,....................................................................................................................................
They use hospital-grade antiviral fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floors.
The building enforces its own safety protocols by using products that support the safety of the tenants.
We're happy that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located on WeWork, who has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to full remote working mode, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
The discussion is ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time teleworking colleagues realize that this may need adjusting and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit the length of a meeting to one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider dividing it into several days.
Definise the meeting clearly, make an agenda, and send in the reading material beforehand.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connections.
Designate a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and note the speaker list, and someone to help make meeting notes (or do collaborative note-making).
Email tech support if you need a comfortable headset.

The HR Operations Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support increased work that is distributed across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declares the pandemic is over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellations and other restrictions might make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those targets.
next week we'll follow up with additional guides about Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.

We'll send you an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're in this together and we want to help as much as we can.

These are steps that we believe are essential to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we planned be there waiting for us when the time comes.
n't now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that's coming in the weeks and maybe months ahead.
We need you all to make it happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work your best when needed.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity opposite angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein has an M2 domain of N-terminal peptidase and a renal amino acid transporter domain of collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II alveolar lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II by vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal of the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into the cell for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein on the spike or bulge of SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endosytosis and the translocation of the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cell.
The process of viral entry also requires the priming of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact leads to the hypothesis that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE inhibitor therapy and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on 11 July 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
further, "use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who are at higher risk for pneumonia, particularly patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipoplyscarid-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours with a 30-minute onset of action plus a 24-hour duration of effect.

Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; the app is designed to ensure they don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may arise with an application-based system, including false positives and the possibility of ineffectiveness if the data the application collects is limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting them to "official" or reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.

Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations have issued statements calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organization sets out eight requirements for government projects:
surveillance must be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
the extension of monitoring and surveillance shall have a sunset clause;
data use should be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and shown to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the further exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
there should be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;

The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the continuous surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.

Israel has approved network-based tracking.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access private location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-app-based systems are used to track contacts.



As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.

PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort containing a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy Protecting Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Cellular Contact Tracking (PACT), etc.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or flow intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.

Google and Apple plan to address the issue of data capture and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
Repositioning (also called re-targeting, re-profiling, or re-tasking) is the use of an already approved drug for a new treatment purpose, i.e. for a different disease or medical condition from the original purpose of drug development.
This is a scientific research pathway currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be targeted by drugs, each protein having several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these ligand binding sites may form the basis for a project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerase, helikase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussein A A, et al. investigated several candidate compounds which were then optimized and analyzed for structural similarity to the drugs that had been approved and had the highest similarity in order to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in their preclinical studies to be recommended in the design of the clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.

Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the emergence of resistance through mutation which can cause disease and more severe transmission.
Some early-stage studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials being conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled placebo (Hong Kong, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

b'Vaccin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).


5 candidate vaccines are in Phase I safety studies as of April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The pandemic spread worldwide in 2020, resulting in massive investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using the published genome to develop a vaccine that might be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
CEPI Initiative issued a statement in April that the things to look for in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment at the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The primary platform targets that advanced to Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II trials conduct preliminary safety and immunogenicity trials, usually conducted randomly, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines for preventing disease, while monitoring for side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines being actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 of them have not been in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" studies).

As of March 2020, government, industry, and three US universities were pooling resources to access IBM's supercomputers, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologous effect, also called a nonspecific effect.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
A further trial in Australia tried to follow 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
The initial studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, suggest the need for containment measures to achieve biosafety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no drug or vaccine for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.

As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
THE CONSPIRIT THEORY
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Though most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and complex organ failure.

568,000 have been cured. The virus is spread mainly between humans through close contact, often through splashes or tiny droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although produced during exhalation, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not transmissible over long distances.

On the surface, the virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the subsequent stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and for people who care for them.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some others require their use.
Today, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.


️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, wheezing, or sore throat, may be present, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.

In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, complex organ failure, and death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not everyone who is infected has symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.

China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large viral load.
Talk out loud releases more sparkles or droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause droplet to push up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and that air collectors placed in hallways outside people's rooms produce positive samples for the virus' RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions to be converted into aerosols and then dispersed through the air.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others. The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products break down the protective fatty layer of the virus, deactivating the virus, and freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in the median two days after hospitalization began.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in naturally related coronaviruses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19 as the virus accesses the host cell via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bulge" (peplomer) to attach to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury is found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disruptions during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsies in people who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells have been shown to correlate with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocyte recruitment and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrate has also been reported in autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on a breath sample obtained through nasopharyngeal suction; however, nasal suction or sputum samples may also be used.
Typically, results are available within a few hours to two days.
The blood test can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart so that the results have little time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate this strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect infection by this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infection and if a person has been infected before) is in development, but has not been widely used.
China's experience with such testing has shown accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions is commonly encountered early in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The major pathological findings at autopsy were:
Makroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lungs, and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
: pneumonia leve: edema pulmonare, iperplasia pneumocitosa, pneumociti grandiosi, infiammazione interstiziale con infiltrazione linfocitica, e formazione di gigantes cellulari multisnucleari
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction

CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
CDC recommends the use of cloth face masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restraint strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with large numbers of people, by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and canceling large-scale gatherings in public places.

In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance "is not an active agent for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humektan.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs that are affected.
CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they're carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.

Intensive care and pulmonology in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel prefer to recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an AIIR in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airway precautions.

N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require mechanical ventilation or an alternative, but some cases are severe.

It is not known whether either of these methods yields the same benefit for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Heavy cases are more common in the elderly (people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries lack adequate hospital beds per capita, limiting the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases which is so severe that hospitalization is required.
A study in China found that 5% went to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients who are admitted to hospitals end up in ICU.
Ventilation
Ventilators capable of high pressure control and PEEP modes are needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung and pneumothorax injury.
A high PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.

Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.

Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with severe illness.
The FDA has granted provisional authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is severely or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.

Persons may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are perfect storms that are endangering the mental health and well-being of the public".
The disease can be mild with little or no symptoms, which resembles other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Simple cases usually heal within two weeks, whereas those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.

In people who are most severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or complex organ failure.
COVID-19related complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Dysfunction of blood clotting, particularly increased prothrombin time, was observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while impaired renal function was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 profile show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
,,,,..............................................................................................................................
In a study that looked at early cases, the median time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exudates in both lungs.
Virus cytopathia was observed in the pneumocytes.
The pulmonary picture is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac damage was observed, with either increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people admitted to hospitals have a congenital condition. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources in a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from conditions vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A lack of light case counting may lead to over-counting of deaths.

Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers. There are concerns about the long-term sequelae of this disease.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.

Immunity is considered to be achieved, if looking at the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases of recovering COVID-19 followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
Tisbelievedthiscaseis a worsening residual infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and animal-derived, via infection that spreads.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest onset of symptoms as December 1, 2019.
The official WHO publication reported the earliest onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Typically, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
The number varies by region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.

According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-case mortality ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.

Though not all people who are infected make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through Carnival festivals, which spread among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and it is likely that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) are confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies done in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between men and women not being seen until the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reasons.
Immunological differences by sex, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men having comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.

Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
Women are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Chairman Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".

In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute respiratory disease as provisional names for viruses and diseases in line with 2015 guidelines which urged not to use location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in dire need of ventilator valves, and suppliers couldn't supply them in the required time scale, a local company re-engineered and printed 100 of the necessary valves overnight.

The study failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.


In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the treatment effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being studied.
First, researchers aim to make a vaccine for the virus that is whole.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead, aims to rapidly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to specific subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccination (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for making vaccinations).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Newly targeted antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries with a reporting deadline of late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is already available. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.

though, there are calls for a peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.

On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the policy of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition Chinese guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
The initial data suggested that high doses of ribavirin were needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. The study showed that early priming of the proton protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE2 receptors.

Cytokine storm complications can occur in advanced-stage severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antistatic properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing a phase 2 trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, this drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are suspected to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified and bound antibodies produced by the systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a method of passive nonvaccination.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action for passive antibody therapy to mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, is in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is the liquid part of the patient's blood that has healed and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavirus, a group of closely related syndromes
