Cumulative Incidence in Rapid Growth of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 that will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a conglomerate of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the causative agent was a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we looked at trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compared them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Acumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; in this way, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases cut to 14 days in the EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK exhibited similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries are, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed testing.
By early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their peak capacity.
Data on admissions of cases of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data is not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100 000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of health care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a risk of >90% of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Given that, so far, conglomerates of cases have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and that hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional reception population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, should prepare for a sustained community-wide transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, it is essential to adopt a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, by shifting from a containment approach to a mitigation one, given that the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response in a consistent manner unless implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the deaths of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere around the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the cockroach and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still have no answer, we hope this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard and indelible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home for the entire festival and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number one” and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the advances in research on this new subject that is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some crucial questions that have yet to be answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause around 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have met two times with highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a terrifying morbidity and mortality.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third coronavirus recorded in human history.
As shown in Fig. 1, pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to China’s National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the infection was from healthcare providers, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the site of origin of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and 50 more countries around the world (fig. 2).
Since the situation evolves rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly people aged 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 spread to conglomerates mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, there were 5 days (from 2 to 9) between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from apparition to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% IC: 3.51-4,05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (masculine), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, wrapped viruses that contain a single-chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genres, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alfacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cell receptors, the angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of viral RNA is released to the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, along with the glucoproteins of the envelope and nucleocapside proteins, form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is congruent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secreted protein coded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b could have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 contains no known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length human ACE2 electron cryomicroscopy structure at 2.9 Å resolution, in complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic diana for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in mosquitoes and were transmitted to humans by civettes and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the deer was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two deer-like coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the transmission route remains to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed serpents as bearers of the mosquito virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long fox mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a moisture of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 % ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chlorophore and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
Generally, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectin type C receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturing of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
Cooperative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defensive cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction from the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst of cases, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by occurrence in conglomerates, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; it is this way that asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study from late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98 %), dry cough (47 %) and dyspnea (55 %) as primary symptoms.
However, 80 percent of them needed respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in accordance with the higher MERS lethality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99 percent to 100 percent), dry cough (29 percent to 75 percent), dyspnea (40 percent to 42 percent), diarrhea (20 percent to 25 percent) and sore throat (13 percent to 25 percent) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed in approximately 14 percent to 20 percent of patients.
By 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was to be high and elevated to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only oscillated between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Conglomeration usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a travel or residence history in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to the appearance.
However, it has been that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospitalized patients can re-contract the virus, a warning sign that the quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzyme and myoglobin levels were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the degradation of fibrine present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
Abnormalities are detected in thoracic radiographies of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or opacities in bilateral smelly glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (AGD).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in chest x-rays are usually parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the exfoliation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and lymphocyte infiltration in the interstitial, and multinucleated sincial cells in the lungs of a patient who died due to the disease, which is coincidental with the pathology of a viral infection and the SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter sample) using a graduated rod in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can drastically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors may mostly provide supporting care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include treatments currently in use or potential with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the digestive tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the biggest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to relieving symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) assistance, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory failures.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 anti-receptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, cautious use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time has been recommended for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of this analysis, the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other monocatenary RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS.
Based on these, Gilead has supplied the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and generation of antibodies
The extraction of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected to 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and better blood oxygen saturation.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for its large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine-release syndrome, potentially producing deadly toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or look for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease according to the MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or are inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while the province of Hubei, which used MCT in only around 30 percent of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study in which Western medicine (MO) treatment was compared only to the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance and hospitalization were notably shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising, the rate of symptom worsening (light to severe) was notably lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT are still awaiting more well-controlled trials at larger scales and at more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the outbreak of SARS, a number of psychiatric morbidities were, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health attention should be given to patients with COVID-19, people with suspicion and people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Essential vaccines are effective in interrupting the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible guests, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent, long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live attenuated viruses in animal models have been evaluated for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these possible vaccines in older people and the models of lethal stimulation and their protection against zoonotic-origin virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical trial is initiated.
This is probably because SARS vanished 17 years ago and no new case has been recorded since then.
However, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) needed for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequences.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were aged over 50 in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably older than those who did not require them (with an average age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive colangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between PCR level and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the patient’s evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensely in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they constitute traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: Thorax X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high-dose corticosteroid use was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which greatly makes it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were seriously ill, while transmission mostly did not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Large efforts are being made at this time in China, which include the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of stopping the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are generating noticeable damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended in March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could turn into a flu-like cyclic episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies might be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed to be controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectiousness and eventually extinct or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with material contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the stool, which poses a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases that 41% of cases may have been caused by infections in nosocomios, which includes 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers in contact with infected patients or people.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (serial number 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or attached to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear tailor-made insulating beets in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; it is possible that the virus has entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear protective blankets or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population washes their hands with disinfectant soaps further than usual, tries to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limits contact with people who may be infected.
It is considered that three feet is an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with the 2003 outbreak of SARS.
However, it wasn’t until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had a low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain the disease.
This message remarkably relaxed the public’s alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment was wasted to contain the disease at a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this tough lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public ads, as every word matters to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or their decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in its early stages, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing tailored and effective simulations to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases and test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the feeling of the reappearance of SARS.
However, there are some notorious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do so when they are seriously ill, which generates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients may be positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid advances in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain unresolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like rod coronavirus, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from rodents.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, flies, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to slow the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can reappear at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it is transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or periodically reappear like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the currency by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put the coronavirus at the center of attention again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronaviruses originate in mosquitoes, where they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating the interactions between coronaviruses and hosts in animals could also give important insights into the pathogenicity of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present an overview of existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and species-to-species transmission.
Notably, we compared and contrasted different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genomic recombination.
The current coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
Additionally, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of positive monocatenary RNA viruses with envelope.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called “coronavirus” due to their morphology, because of the crown shape they have under an electronic microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polyprotein replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for the structural proteins, including spike (S), wrap (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of specific accessory proteins from each lineage are also coded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genres (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronaviruses contains most human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that rodents are the source of genes for most alfacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
So far, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfacoronaviruses.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively greater number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (AGD) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The outbreak of SARS that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude mortality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in mosquitoes, mice or domestic animals.
Various lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in mice, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and restrictive factors of species-to-species jump.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing the spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, species-to-species transmission and human coronavirus pathogenicity.
In particular, we highlighted and analyzed the common issue that human coronavirus parent viruses are normally not pathogens in their natural reservoir hosts, but they become pathogens after species-to-species transmission to a new host.
We also examined the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as duck, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Over the past decade, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultivation and subsequently passed serially in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia,” caused the first well-documented pandemic caused by a human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8096 cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was calculated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and colds, followed by shortness of breath, cough and difficulty breathing as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated levels of creatine kinase are common abnormal results in laboratory tests for SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytocin storm, which could be deadly, in immunosuppressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to human coronavirus research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old boy from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was determined to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of chickenpox, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents from unknown causes have occurred, such as the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and remain continuous in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional contagion have been in close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among human coronavirus-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded, with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and called the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude mortality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, mortality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronavirus (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most commonly observed in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, which includes the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly smaller.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronavirus and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronavirus.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, should still be clarified in future studies.
It is also of special interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with community-acquired human coronavirus.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passages, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four community-acquired human coronavirus that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed serious diseases by human coronavirus have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restrictive factors.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If adapted well, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four community-acquired coronaviruses have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as the four community-acquired human coronavirus.
It is highly transmissible like human-acquired community-acquired coronavirus, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronavirus and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before we analyze the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus continuously and long-term.
In both cases, the guests become infected naturally and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction in humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and perform the amplifier host function by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Civetes from masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a mapache dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was supported indirectly by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civettes in the markets.
However, it was that civettes from wild or farm masked palm trees without exposure to live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that civettes from masked palm trees would only act as an intermediate amplifier host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, given that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as intermediate SARS-CoV amplifiers cannot be ruled out.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the SARS-CoV natural animal host revealed a closely related rodent coronavirus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus rodent CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese ferradura rodents.
These rodents are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other rodent coronavirus share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that mosquitoes host emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in rodents, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of rodents uses ACE2 from rodents, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Surprisingly, serums from patients with convulsive SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closestly related ancestor of SARS-CoV in rodents, which shares a 95 percent nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that flies are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of deer and the CoV-HKU5 of deer.
The mosquito CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to their rotting betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild rodents.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the dwarf CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the dwarf may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive to MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, just like camels native to the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from dromedarian nasal exudate, further supporting that camels act as good-faith hosts of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
In general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels was observed for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only by respiratory, but also by fecal-oral, which is also the main pathway for the spread of mosquito viruses.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a rodent coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from rodents Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, mosquitoes might not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they find themselves in the future coronavirus of mosquitoes practically identical.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed on the Huanan wholesale seafood market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share a 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RaTG13, with an identity of around 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sublineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor bond domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In marked contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a greater degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolines also detection of viral contacts in lung samples, which appear to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising around 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronavirus.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in rodents, pangolines and other mammals is yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genomic sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronaviruses is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal advocates a recombination between pangolines-related SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 beta-coronaviruses in the third wildlife species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
No conclusion has yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Philogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from rodent coronavirus, while parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses have been found in rodents.
It was that an ARCoV.2 (Apalachian Mountains Coronavirus) coronavirus detected in a tricolor North American deer was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another carcass coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge to date of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of human coronavirus transmission between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The background of species-to-species transmission of HCoV-229E is not known with such accuracy.
Alfacoronavirus has been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alfacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the mosquito virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with frogs in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, the HCoV-229E-related alfacoronavirus of carcasses is diverse and non-pathogenic in carcasses, while the alfacoronavirus of carcasses caused a outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alfacoronavirus of alpacas has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire the HCoV-229E-related alfacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, rodents are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising that mosquitoes transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while rodent alfacoronavirus acts as a genetic stock of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of species-to-species transmission, from mosquitoes to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in rodents is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been backed up by later findings.
It is evident that mosquitoes contribute, with a profound collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly, are all favorable conditions that make flies the ideal "virus spreader".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host, to being a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease andins a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolines, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolines’ betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, such as civettes in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of species-to-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, rodents could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with frogs, through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and the consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both rodents and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing species barriers.
First, its relatively high rates of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, estimated coronavirus mutation rates could be considered “moderate” to “high”, with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the coronavirus’ adaptation phase to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a read-control exorribonuclease, whose elimination leads to extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotide analog remdesivir suppresses coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that has been proven in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation in humans.
It is expected that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic derivation is unlikely to cause vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long ARN genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the probability of co-evolution between species, which favores the appearance of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by copious unique open reading frames and the functions of proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change templates during RNA replication using a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing vehicle, chain change often occurs during coronavirus RNA transcription.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as slang SL-CoV and slang CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences species-to-species transmission.
Currently, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in species-to-species transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civettes, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in the amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from various animals, including rodent, civette, mouse and mapache dog, allowing transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civeta viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the receptor bond motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of civettes has K479N and S487T mutations in their RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spiga protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental for the virus’ adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of protein S with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study noted the 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this bond compared to that of human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correceptor may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, following the transmission between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of transmitting human coronavirus between species is also determined by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as mosquitoes, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to species-to-species transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host dependence factors and subvert host restriction factors in order for species-to-species transmission to be successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still have to be identified and characterized.
Objective full genomic research of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
New human coronavirus: start from scratch
The diversity of rodent coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, rodent coronaviruses act as the genetic stock of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related tortoise viruses have been isolated, but it has been determined that they code divergent ORF8 proteins.
A removal of 29 nucleotides characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the onset of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a possible recombinant history with alpha and gamma coronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses recombine with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to undesirable changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in releasing viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in HCoV-229E-related rodents and camels viruses, the alfacoronavirus of alpacas presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, which causes a change in frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when mosquitoes were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and mosquitoes.
Apparently, rodents are well adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activating the pro-inflammatory response in rodents effectively reduce coronavirus-induced pathology.
Additionally, the activity of natural killer cells in frogs is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
Additionally, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of frogs could suppress coronavirus replication and affect exorribonuclease reading check, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as rodents and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong host immune response.
Here are the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and to the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In the asymptomatic carrier, the immune response has dissociated from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of disconnecting the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in mice.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflamasoma NLRP3 in mosquitoes is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflamasoma with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a betacoronavirus has been found that shares a 95 percent nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a 96 percent nucleotide coronavirus with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civettes and other market animals have been determined to host SARS-CoV-identical viruses, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Betacoronaviruses of pangolines notably homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that betacoronaviruses of pangolines could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or accidentally.
Coronaviruses have recovered due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in rodents and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in rodents and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from human and civette contact in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civettes there could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lineages of pangolines-betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transportation tool, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it was done in China with wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, rodent coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great chances that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan of preparedness and response should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to propagate appears.
Although mosquitoes have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with mosquitoes and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
There are still several pieces missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if rodents transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances rodents and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if mosquitoes have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with mosquitoes.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, mice and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a rodent, pangolines, or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will uncover the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for the “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide included our experience and constitutes a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicious case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological backgrounds with two points of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be met if there are no clear epidemiological backgrounds:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence history in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) contact history with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with nucleic acid test positive); (3) contact history with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) contact history with confirmed cases groups (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, a school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some pathogenic or serological test characteristics as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to recognised new coronaviruses; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase in title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or respiratory samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
and N
Moreover, more and more evidence reminds us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flow diagram should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The score system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspicious case” and “confirmed case”, we recommend searching for and complying with the latest guidelines of your country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh that the number of infected cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been.
In an online briefing session, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Daca.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, whom they were treating at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh’s Minister of Transport by Road and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, two men who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, these three had already recovered.
More than 1 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related deaths.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization 1,051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 a.m., central European time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the resting touches in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the resting touch onlyined between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a drop-off between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1.
Australian supermarkets lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of one package.
These restrictions were posted as messages on the boxes and on the chain’s Facebook pages.
Consumers werely supplying themselves for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, “many supermarkets still exhaust the product within an hour of delivery,” and said the claim “had no precedent,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was “unexpected.”
Sales rose with a “strong increase” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further ease the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for an anticipated Wednesday special offer.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local municipality restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult.
It foresees an increase in production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets could not make the Wednesday special offer.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a voluminous item, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and when it is exhausted, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large amounts, it would probably minimize panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday they had exhausted stocks.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures toilet paper Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long Workers’ Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-printed newspaper, included an eight-page cover designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO highlighted the need to push governments to take action:
Every country can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic “has no precedent.”
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, “besides the flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from appearance to continued worldwide spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic before that can be controlled at the same time,” he added.
The new pandemic condition arises after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, “in conclusion, it will get worse.”
As of Thursday, Associated Press there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
Around 364,000 people were recovered.
It was estimated that the rate of death by cases is 4 % in China, while, globally, it ranges from 13,04 % in Algeria to 0,08 % in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from other people and controlling and isolating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, shutdowns, hazard controls in the workplace and closures of facilities.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages aggravated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was spread over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry shutdowns, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei province) a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation was launched.
The cases, for the most part, were related to the Huanan wholesale seafood market, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to mosquito coronavirus, pangolines coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person known to have manifested symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last wet market group.
Of the first group of cases in December 2019, two-thirds were determined to have a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unchecked report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei, could have been the first.On February 26, 2020, the WHO that, as new cases, according to reports, declined in China but increased suddenly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China had surpassed, for the first time, the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases had been in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 tests and obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had performed tests on more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to perform tests on people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that, in China, by January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of the cases registered.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most frequent 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, around 80 percent of deaths were from people over 60 years old, and 75 percent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.The official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who died positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 is much higher, as people who died without testing are not included, for example, in their homes, in old-age homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths from COVID by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, “We know [the number of deaths] is a underestimation,” a statement corroborated by anecdotal subcount reports in the U.S. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first deaths outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories had deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics, such as age, sex and general health.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths on cases is 6.0% (97.039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3 % (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 % (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other indicators include the mortality rate by cases, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died due to a disease, and the mortality rate by infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a definite deadline and consider a specific population from the infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the total mortality rate from pandemic infections is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on estimates of the case-by-case mortality rate.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of the Pennsylvania State University said, “Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without available guests.
But at this time, it’s almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen.”
China's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it "could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it’s so easily transmitted, will disappear completely” and “could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year.”
The virulence of the relapse would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the respiratory tract (flema), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, colds, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pressure or pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blueish color in the face or lips; before the manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, do not show clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers advised to carefully monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30%, and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through small droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when talking.
Drops can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and thus air propagation.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through stools, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results on disease tests up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not completely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature.Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests conducted on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenre sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the deer.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96% identical to other samples of dwarf coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolines viruses and those of humans.
To date, the full genomic comparison indicated that the pangolines coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share up to 92 percent of the genetic material, which is not enough to prove that pangolines are the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be diagnosed provisionally on the basis of symptoms, although it is ultimately confirmed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography imaging.
According to a Wuhan study comparing the polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonies.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed with a nasopharyngeal hisope, although a hisope for the throat can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough to allow its widespread use to be approved.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by only certified laboratories.
Characteristic features in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral glare opacities and absent pleural outflows.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained in images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study conducted in China compared the results of computerized tomography of the chest with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging diagnosis is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with radiographs and computerized tomographs.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease includeining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without having washed them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable cloth and throwing the cloth directly into a waste container.
Those who may already be infected are recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Many governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from the countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare providers who care for someone who might be infected are recommended to take the standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been deployed or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who gave a positive COVID-19 test.They are circulating misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and gargling with mouthwashing are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have visibly dirty hands; before eating and after sneezing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0,1 % sodium hypochloride, 0,5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0,2–7,5 % povidon iodized.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a facility, such as an office or nursery, disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by sick people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or with a disposable toothpaste to cough or sneeze, and throw off the toothpaste immediately.
Those who may be infected are recommended to wear surgical masks, as using a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the respiratory droplets that are dispersed when talking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Using a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.”
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend people to make fabric masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited going out into public spaces without wearing a mask or without covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask when in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has imposed an obligation to wear masks on everyone entering a supermarket.
Israel has urged all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks per day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded the use of masks by passengers on interurban trains and buses.
Panama has imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while it also recommends the manufacture of home-made masks to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes measures for infection control designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and shutdown of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping centers.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Elderly adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and CDC recommend that they stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" by "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact whileining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term “social detachment” has resulted in the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with other people through alternative means.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health organizations have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation.Many governments have demanded or recommended the self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
Stricter instructions on self-quarantine were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to do self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling a outbreak are contention or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and has the purpose of identifying and isolating infected people, as well as introducing other measures of infection control and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of control and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1.Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantine; community-oriented measures aimed at physical detachment, such as shutdown of schools and cancellation of mass competition events; community commitment to foster acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to do quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it should beined for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise transmission reactivates quickly when measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic implies social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, which includes testing existing drugs.
Taking free-selling cold medications, drinking liquids and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also indicated that some “home and traditional remedies” can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key measure of response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines aimed at hospitals and primary care services for the redistribution of resources at various levels, which includes focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating patients positive for COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called zero patient) could have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.

The WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 outbreak of SARS, when it accused Chinese authorities of secrecy that hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government “has provided periodic updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays.”
On January 23, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a ban on transportation in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, although "definitely not a recommendation that WHO has made," it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health".On January 30, after the confirmation of the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak an international public health emergency (ESPII), the sixth ESPII since it was invoked the measure for the first time during the 2009 influenza pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said ESPII was due “to the risk of spreading globally, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems.”

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for their handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial-level Chinese Communist Party (CCP) administrators were fired due to their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected a previous recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and said that "Censorship of China has overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction[] from the failure of its administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a communications strategy with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and the strategy was cited as "Everything About China."
We have been told that we try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union’s foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while itly sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
He also accused U.S. authorities of diverting aid to other countries to his own country.
And disputes related to masks have been between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators intended for Spain.

Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid was "inutile or of little use for Italy."
The source accused Russia of undertaking a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering help to U.S. colleagues [Putin] assumes that, when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to correspond if necessary.”
NATO’s planned military exercise “Defender 2020” in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.

South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized about Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon's dismissal for what they considered a bad handling of the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, their parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections and sanction those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
It blamed the coronavirus outbreak for several cases of supply shortages, as a result of the increased worldwide use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions in logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruption.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand generated up to twenty times the normal price, and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas was affected by acute food shortages.
China and Italy’s measures against the illicit accumulation and trade of essential products have been successful, and prevented an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its significant agricultural production, has not had a considerable reduction, but prices could rise, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to keep reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 journalistic report, China’s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Given that mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the outbreak has been considered a significant destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002–2004 outbreak of SARS.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was “revolted” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average their most pronounced drops since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the largest drop in a day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with downs of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but retained a negative outlook.
The stock fell again on the basis of fears about the coronavirus, the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be a recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation by governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the sector of cruise companies reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and shipping terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year’s festivals, while private companies also independently shut down their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year’s Day holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50-60% drop.
This also caused a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
The operators of shopping centers around the world imposed additional measures, such as improved hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than they would have been in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in the Hubei province.
The outbreak of the coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Luis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of unemployment. About 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented government-subsidized short-term work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which impacted the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have sought to fulfill their mission (often funded with public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and at various degrees, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows had been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasing consequence at an accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. major sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian penance season of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have offered religious services through radio, live broadcast on the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also canceled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwares.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans for the 2020 Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “reprogrammed for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021”.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online gambling sites significant increases in their new registration rates.The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of “festivals” on the Internet for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Numerous Internet memes about the coronavirus have spread online, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a just retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient Chinese feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on and off the Internet.
Following the rise of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese, along with other Asian people in the UK and the United States, have higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term that many critics have considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign displaced people from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, have suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata party’s state unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, expressed that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God revenged them.”
In China, they increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and described foreigners as “foreign garbage” and destined for “waste.”
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise disease mortality rate and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had carried out tests to more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting cases mortality rates, which are probably highly overestimated in some countries.
Through real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopaths or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hisopaths is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled by coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was conducted in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on clinical-grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from China’s National Medical Product Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel for the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated unfinished results due to faulty reagents, and a stall in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were satisfactorily processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only then were state and local laboratories allowed to start performing tests.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use permit.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of COVID-19 testing based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, on March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available tests for COVID-19 nationally.
No quantity limits have been announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Medical Care Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, it was that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that lasts approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermic amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are around 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day.In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a quick influenza test.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that “thorax x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computerized tomography] results can be obtained even before symptoms appear.”
Typical features in the TC include bilateral multilobar opacities in de-lustrated glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease advances, subpleural dominion, pattern in emphedral and consolidation develops.
According to a study in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonies.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
Part of the immune system’s response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to track the immune response.
For attention-point tests, a single blood sample is usually obtained by a puncture on the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required before analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can therefore now distribute their antibody tests.
By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for specimen", the patient spit in the tube, sends it and gets a result shortly. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used.
The drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurers said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that tests had been carried out on 10,700 people the previous week.
Health insurance carries the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, tests were offered using the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in the calendar week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed in total, including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) produced positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping samples and only doing more analyses if the combined sample results positive. On February 5, 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI inaugurated a 2,000-square-meter improvised emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火, or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian, and that took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% greater and that the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled without this ability for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day.Open-source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 analyses.These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use fluid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the U.S.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to do more tests.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection tests per person in their population than any other country, and was aimed at increasing the level of tests to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and the purchase of a population-level mass production laboratory of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside of China.
Different test formulas that address different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, which delayed the tests available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the tests.
On the contrary, experts say the high availability of South Korean tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean government has achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private-sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hisopaths and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented the conduct of private tests.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sampling or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that threw incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a “high error rate” and did not “put them into use”.
Testing, complemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of people with whom they had been in contact who gave positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death from COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests across the population of around 3,400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all cases detected were placed in quarantine.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but which did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened on time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less strict confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have carried out more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower cases mortality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have capacity for testing and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to any of the WHO’s 16 reference laboratories to make confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the “Positive as % of tests” column is influenced by the country’s testing policy.
A country that only performs tests on people who enter hospitals will have a higher number of positive as % of tests than a country that performs tests on all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands with the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If there is no water or soap available, hands can be cleaned with ashes.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of an ill person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After sounding your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or who work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; and decreasing respiratory infections.
Reduce child mortality in the home.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in the growth in height of children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced with the introduction of simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, and kills an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetuousness, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause skin damage due to the dryness of the skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin scaly known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in health workers.
Too frequent handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce oral-fetal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (urining, defecating), after cleaning a child’s tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other occasions when a proper handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or sonicating the nose; after touching animal waste or manipulating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries concluded that, on average, 38.7% of households practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was close to half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate with 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviors, to increase the adoption of the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times.
The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a tailor-made action to promote children’s health and education.
Washing your hands twice a year, washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are flushed with foam.
Still, the CDC states that “liquid soap with controls for dispensation that do not involve using hands is preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been intensely promoted for a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence to demonstrate that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
Thus, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, antimicrobial-active benzoic acid and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A thorough analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for consumers that contain triclosan to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from hands.
A nice hot water for washing hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water to remove the natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a water-free agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and in the first part of the 21st century, agents for hand hygiene without water and with alcohol to rub (also known as alcohol-based hand solution to rub, antiseptic solution for hands to rub or hand disinfectants) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the resequedad effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity.Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants for rubbing eliminate bacteria, bacteria resistant to various drugs (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 logaritm reduction, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4.5 logaritm reduction) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to rub, such as to moisturize or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dry out.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend washing hands before hand disinfectants are used, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid activity of eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper handwashing unless there is no water or soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can dry up the skin, unless skin softeners or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing softeners caused considerably less irritation and dry skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends largely on the ingredients and formula, and historically has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, it has been proven that formulations using benzalcony chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or soil.
Ashes or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with stagnant water can be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Restrain for at least 20 seconds.
Restraining creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and restraining for longer periods removes more germs.
Wash well with running water.
Washing in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated.The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail enamel can house microorganisms.
Often, moisturizing lotion is recommended to prevent hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Various economical options can be used to facilitate handwashing when there is no running water or soap available, for example, pouring water from a hanging bowl or a cage with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries.
A homemade barrel is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a barrel and a lever powered by the foot to pour a small amount of water onto the hands and a barrel soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the paper towel industry association European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by the most modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 percent in the fingers and 254 percent in the palms.
Drying with air jets resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palms.The scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow off microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
Using a hot-air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Washing hands with hand disinfectant towels is an alternative during travel, when there is no water or soap.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing for doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
The doctor’s hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrain all parts of the hands.
The hands should be narrowed together by intertwining the fingers.
If there are remnants underneath the nails, you can use a pig brush to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, use the paper towel to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and prevent their transmission.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and, thus, transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard handwashing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sector.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if proof of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Moments” for Hand Washing:
Exposure to blood or body fluids
After an asymmetrical and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap ("medical" or "antibacterial" soaps) gives the possibility of removal to the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common.To wash your hands before a surgical operation, you need to have a hose that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to rub and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, generally, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, the water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical bat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after treating sick people.
To control staph-caused infections in hospitals, it has been proven that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
When comparing handwashing with an alcohol solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing H1N1 flu virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand disinfectant and written and oral reminders to staff.
It is necessary to investigate more about which of these interventions are the most effective in the different healthcare environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered to be an economical and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to universal handwashing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand washing stalls near public or private retreats, although there are economical options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of rooted habits and not the lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing and provoke long-term behavioral change in the population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three Star” approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economical measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand washing that are being carried out to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-raising campaign that seeks to a change in behavior.As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newborn mothers or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English, the “founder of modern nursing.”
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with “correct techniques for washing hands” were hung next to the toilets of public toilets and of the bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing your hands” is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase of much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and that had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value items for handwashing more.
In addition, those people who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory “cleaning” actions, such as volunteering.
Symbolic handwashing, with water, but without soap, is part of ritual handwashing in many religions, such as Bahá'í, Hinduism, Tevilá and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, lavatory in Christianity and Wudu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require you to wash your hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam compel you to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Workplace Risk Controls for COVID-19
The workplace risk controls before COVID-19 refer to the application of methodologies of occupational hygiene and safety in the risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal working contact with the public and colleagues, for which basic prevention measures are advised, including handwashing, recommending workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards andining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Work with average exposure risk includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who could be infected by current community transmission or by an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective blankets and personal protection equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that health care and funeral workers exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have various consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they get sick, because they have to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both with regard to what goods are demanded and the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying at hours that are not peak, by means of home or car shipping services).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and individual workers’ risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the necessary controls to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to a outbreak include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting people at greater risk of adverse health complications,ining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
Risk control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policies or procedures that require action from the employee or employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the danger to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, inspected frequently,ined, replaced if necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or discarded properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal working contact with the public and co-workers.
Basic infectious prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent handwashing, advising workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene rules including coughing and sneezing, providing paper clothes and containers for waste, preparing for remote work or gradual shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using foreign tools and equipment, andining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a key measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay in their homes until they cease to have fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or decrease fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact less than six feet (1,8 m) away with people who are neither known nor suspected to have COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the company location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These are the most frequent work-heads to protect workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, protective workplaces with a lot of people’s concentration and some large-scale retail workplace environments. The engineering controls for this group and the high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as the presence protective blankets of transparent plastic and the placement of a window shift for the worker’s care service so that the customer can ask from the automobile. The administrative controls for this group and the high-risk groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing the presence of virtual communications meetings, establishing the minimum possible public turns, suspending the journeys that are non-essential to those with current outbreaks of COV-19, such as developing emergency hygiene communications plans that include the use of a worker’s resource, according to a counterfactor measure, and with the environment and exposure that they have to offer.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with paper clothes when they cough or sneeze.
The cabin crew must wear disposable surgical gloves to treat a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a hazardous biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected subsequently.In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing the journey due to illness, self-isolation and immediately reporting to the medical center on board if someone shows fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other massive meetings, such as physical education or choir classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between pupitres, scaling entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate place for the health room for children who have flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the cancellation of classes may be considered to be extended.For police personnel carrying out routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Police officers who should contact people who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment with aerosols or household cleaning towels before using them again and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothes.
The OSHA considers that certain healthcare and morga workers are within categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the high-risk exposure jobs are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected diagnoses of COVID-19.
These become jobs of very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected diagnoses of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue jobs include those in which workers are involved in preparing the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; these go on to have a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for those risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19, even when they are undergoing aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some healthcare and morge environments.
The samples should be manipulated by taking Biosecurity Level 3 precautions.
In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with NIOSH-approved filtration mask or higher should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, care for them or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, glasses or facial protector, bat and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is carried out, the surgical mask should be replaced with a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting permission to enter the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those people involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

This year we are in strange circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it poses are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we’ve seen among all our peers in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we’re lucky to work with are.
I could not feel greater gratitude and pride that you all are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, either by keeping sites running, helping our colleagues get their payment, or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting this coming week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we believed would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it’s okay.
For all employees, contractors and contractual workers:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We’re not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great help for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place nowadays, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We are not counting your hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
Although it is not necessary to say it, we say it.
You don’t need to ask for sick leave or paid leisure; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you get a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, of T&C Operations, so T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff colleagues who work by hour.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it’s about your personal care.
What we ask you is to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt correctly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are a few things we must continue to do.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, perform a critical job that might require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate current goals and change our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don’t plan to “double the hours to get up to date” when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What is the App or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Planning for 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and caring for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with reduced hours over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will communicate the next steps to the delegates and the teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, Exhibition and Cleaning of Office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues at the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-use antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and the elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty-of-care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located on a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members at DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have already worked remotely before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings to intervals of one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to divide them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send reading materials in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person to control questions in the chat and speaker list, and someone to help you take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the welfare refund for refrigerators.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
RR.HH.’s Operations team is analyzing web-based ergonomics guidelines to support increased work spread across the Foundation.
This past week we urged all community-funded recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editatons, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We inform you that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to fulfill your part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no sanction for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the community globally seems to be, in part, sadness for the interruption and, in part, relief for the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will be working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and track our communications with them.
Maintaining contact with COVID-19
We will send you an invitation through your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 h, Coordinated Universal Time 07:00 h, Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and are available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can still find the information in this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently being heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, any coverage issue, or anything you may need help with, don’t hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations at RR.HH.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Rather, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations probably have to be adapted in a way that hadn’t happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other in order to continue working, to give our movement the necessary support and to provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and, possibly, in the coming months.
We need all of you so that this is possible and that is why we need you to take care of and take care of your families so that you can find yourself in the best condition possible when need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the external surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converter enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic diana for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The converter enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal renal amino acid carrier domain of colectrine.
ECA2 is a type I unipass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is separated from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and, ultimately, excreted through the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is attached mainly to the cell membrane of alveolar type II cells in the lungs, to the small intestine enterocytes, to venous arterial and endothelial cells, and to the smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
The expression of mARN of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striated body, the hypothalamus and the encephalic trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract ECA.
The ACE divides the hormone from angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 separates the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to form the vasodilatating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also separate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as a primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike protein S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the host’s serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help combat infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A systematic metaanalysis review published on July 11, 2012 determined that “use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as solid for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in leeches with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRA inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is found to be elevated.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contact”) who could have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications have been developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of app users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support these Bluetooth-based apps directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government that the contact tracking app was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for deployment in the coming weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore’s BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to introduce a geo-metric application for patients living in Moscow who have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple has limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store to “official” or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have submitted a statement demanding limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations set eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance would have to be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extension of monitoring and surveillance would have to include termination clauses;
the use of the data should be limited to purposes related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined by law;
protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens’ rights to respond to such abuse should be established;
Significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory.The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) of Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used rather than applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data pose potential significant privacy issues.
However, it is not necessary that all systems with central servers have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see the following section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate text message alerts for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert about potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to widespread changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites.Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Tracking contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a lot of published research dating back, at least, to 2013. By April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking to protect privacy (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never leaves the device and all matching occurs on the device.
MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting techniques by collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report “Applications Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic,” published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and employees, without compromising the privacy of those data.
On April 5, 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincidental protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerts applications, a key aspect for achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that, according to them, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
Implementing tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable foundation for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important diane proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical trial.
Chloroquine is an antipaludic drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the cloroquine and the related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24.On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorochine phosphate through an urgent use authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is authorized under a US only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
The doctors have said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, major studies are underway.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen gave negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reservations and that it would resort to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the drug purchase.The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed."
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola disease and Marburg virus infections.Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two run by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with moderate illness and another for those with a more serious illness.
Three intravenous clinical trials of vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19 are ongoing; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin’s Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
An enzyme-converter form of angiotensin 2, a phase II trial is underway and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who are breastfeeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency has published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparine sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying much attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese Guidelines
Here are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
and N
A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect there would be a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed by early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the main platforms that passed to Phase I security studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be being planned or developed).
A Phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and performed at several locations, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were still not under evaluation in humans (continued in “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was researching the potential of a molecular-subjection vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects testing on humans to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment with neoantigenic vaccines against cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested on humans “within 90 days.”

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research phase and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “great amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine,” against which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
The possible vaccine based on RNAm BNT162 is currently under preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human trials of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemial Preparation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total CEPI investment for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a “national vaccine bank” with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced testing of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, on mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent antigene-specific antibody responses (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacterium and produce virus-like innocuous particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines with COVID-19-specific animal models, such as the ACE-expressing transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the manipulation of living viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SRAG and SROM vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When SROM became widespread, existing research on SRAG was believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, one SROM (DNA-based) vaccine completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, three more were ongoing, all of which are virus vector vaccines, two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Posts on social media promoted a conspiracy theory according to which the causative virus of COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious and contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorgan insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Although these droplets occur when exhaled, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, rather than being contagious at long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.The standard method for diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopath.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary.Some authorities recommend that you do not use them, others recommend that you use them, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal gout and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed oppression in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to spreading the disease.
The proportion of infected people who show no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied.The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1st. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was carried out.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more drops than when speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside people's bedrooms gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and consequently airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through stools, the risk is believed to be low.The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person generally infects two or three more.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load; in the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of the test.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia linked to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it revents its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells through the converting enzyme of angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2), which abounds more in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to connect with the ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe illness.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in UCI patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis. In the autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory lymphocyte infiltrations in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells expressing respiratory ECA2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-lymphocytes correlated with recruitment of IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisopath; however, samples of nasal hisopaths or sputum can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
By April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but not widely used.
Experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 to be used by the end of that month.The diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular smeltered glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination, disordered emphedral pattern (lobular septal enlarging with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological outcomes of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: Pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severe viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Diseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC) and leucoerytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying in the house, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing and, in case you do not have towels, use the inner part of the elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth taps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling multitudinary public meetings.
Distance guidelines also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1,8 m).
As there is no vaccine expected until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as “planning the curve.”
The CDC also recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available on time.For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to get, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antiseptic."
Glycerin is added as a humectant.
Patients are given supportive care, which can include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they have the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and nutrition have been recommended.
Supporting treatments can be useful for those who have mild symptoms in the early stage of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend parecetamol (acetaminophen), instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare environments when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are carried out.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an airborne infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact-related precautions and precautions to prevent airborne transmission.
Recommended equipment is an EPP bat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves.When available, respirators (rather than masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized their use through an urgent use authorization (US).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but they are not guaranteed to be effective against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product indications.
When no masks are available, the CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bippression in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether either of these two brings the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal canyon.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, which limits the health system’s ability to handle the sudden rise in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the UCI.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (AGD) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different modes of pressure control and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take time until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with severe illness.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments.The FDA has granted a temporary authorization to convulsive plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is in serious and immediate danger.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect “strange contact” and thus a potential risk of infection using surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-confiscation, but also alerts local health officials. Mac-data analysis of cellular information, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track data from mobile phones of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary location data of the phones with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect violations of the quarantine.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile operators have informed him that "40% of people still move."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, held a worldwide call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxiety about quarantine, travel restrictions, and side effects of treatment, or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Growing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may follow a mild progression with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases can take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of getting a serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SRAG and SROM, but COVID-19 data is insufficient.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgan failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, altered coagulation, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Disturbance of coagulation, specifically an increase in protombin time, has been observed in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while disturbance of renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the UCI, an average of seven days passed between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cellular fibromixoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembled the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition.The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to regional differences, but also by methodological difficulties.
The insufficient count of mild cases can make the mortality rate overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated long-term effective immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It would seem that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been that subsequently gave positive in coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be an exacerbation of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, pointed out as the first date of symptom onset to December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
There are a number of measures to measure mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, as well as being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with laboratory confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the mortality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to the resolution of cases.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger, so there was a relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, according to blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is highest among men in the studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk among men is for those who are in their 50s, and the gap between men and women closes only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but it may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immunological differences, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected were males and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government will not track gender information in COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to the corona, VI to the virus, D to the disease and 19 to the date when the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations to prevent stigmatisation.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in public communications.
It is common that "coronavirus" is used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and the disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hisops and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company performed reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged that quickly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are seeking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunity vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the protein S that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the disease-causing virus.Anticorps-based improvement has been suggested to be a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chlorochine.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, including nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries that are due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible anti-COVID-19 drugs was ongoing.A number of antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorochine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
By March 2020, there is probative evidence on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China and Italy. Chlorokin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for research.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorokin.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that doubling that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chlorochine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that initial serine-protease-transmembranary type 2 (TMPRSS2) S-protein erection is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with receptor ECA2.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines may be a complication of the final stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-randomized national phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe illness.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, it is expected to counter these effects, which are thought to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine-release syndrome induced by another cause, T-CAR T lymphocyte treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled, non-randomized evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
It is investigating the transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with unsuccessful results.
Viral neutralization is the expected action mechanism by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell-dependent cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to faster distribution.
