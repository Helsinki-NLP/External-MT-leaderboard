Welsh Assembly Members Worried About Being Seen As Puppet
Some members of the Assembly disagree with the proposal that the name should be changed to UPM (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue was raised in connection with plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The name of the Assembly member is threatened to be a joke on the political territory.
One Assembly Member said he was disturbed by the fact that the Labour group was using the terms Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp  means j and pwp j.
The Welsh Party Assembly Member suggested other alternatives, saying the group was largely "unlucky".
The Welsh Conservative noted that the group was open to the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between the phrases MWP and Muppet.
The pronunciation of the Welsh letter w in this text is similar to the pronunciation of the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a bill to propose name changes, said:  The final decision on any specifications regarding how the members of the Assembly are to be named, of course, is made by the members themselves.
In accordance with an Act of the Welsh Government of 2017, the Assembly of Wales has been granted the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which received broad support, to name the assembly the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As for the names of the Assembly members, the Commission preferred the name Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMP, but during the public meeting the majority supported the WMP version.
Members of the Assembly, of course, propose alternatives, but the fight to get to the meeting of the Commission Chair, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft law on changes in a few weeks, may cause some difficulties.
The draft law on reforms contains other changes to the method of working of the Assembly, as well as rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
After the discussion of the draft law, the members of the Assembly vote on the final name of the bill.
Macedonians to go to referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A popular election was held to settle a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece over the province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is attached to its territory and has repeatedly opposed membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Georgi Ivanov, has declared that he will not ignore the results of the referendum.
Referendum officials and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev claim that the name change  is only the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
As the churches of Harlem fight each other, the bells of St. Martin's fall silent.
"The old men I spoke to said that I used to be a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither of them are here.
He said that it is understandable that the rich are missing.
"Today people mix differently", he said.
These are not the neighborhood living rooms that people frequent.
As for the churches, they fear that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later, they will return to their original place".
The churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums, where people live and do not help those who are left in the temple area.
"Most of the people who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "so these churches are accelerating the closing times, so it's doubtful that most of the people who move into these condos will be members of those churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations in Harlem decades later, before becoming the Metropolitan Congregation of St. Martin of the Black Martyrs in 1870.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in 1930.
The black congregation that worshipped nearby had the right to own the building.
The St. Martin building was occupied by the black community led by St. John Howard, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main street in Harlem that was used for shopping, who were opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the church members who visited Father Johnson devised a plan to restore the building and commissioned a carillon.
St. David Johnson, the son and heir of Father Johnson of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural treasure" and "unforgettable historical instrument".
Also, Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, said that the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago, was the first carillon in the world to play.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's Church over the past few months was a heated discussion between the architects and contractors, half of whom were white leaders, and the rest were drawn by the episcopal circle.
The institute, which is composed of the heads of the Aksuyk, the church council, which is subordinate to the mahalla, has informed the mahalla in a written letter in July that it is trying to transfer the expenses to the church council of the mahalla and that the church council has no involvement in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the mahalla.
Some church members complained about the lack of transparency from the neighborhood.
13-year-old boy injured by shark while hunting for lobster in California
In California, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, the opening day of the fishing season, officials said.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammell told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, and when he saw the boy crying for help, a group of people came to his rescue.
Hamel thought it was the effect of the flames, but then he bit me.
He bit me! She said that she understood that she was screaming.
And it came to pass when Hamel had brought forth, that he said, All his loins are rent.
And I called to them, and said, Come forth out of the water: there is a shark in the water.
The boy was airlifted to Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was diagnosed in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles of the Rescue Service said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as a dangerous species.
Giles said that the victim had injuries to the upper part of the chest.
Officials closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct investigations and ensure security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, and most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK fashion market.
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams through its beauty department with sales advisors.
With sales of fine clothing and household goods in decline, and with the UK's fashion market valued at £2.8 billion on the rise, large fashion salons are being tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be rolled out to mass stores next year.
While supermarkets are looking for ways to make the shelves where TVs, short-wave ovens and appliances once stood more convenient, investments in fashion are growing.
Sainsbury's will double the size of its fashion offering for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, to up to 3,000 products.
Also, the existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines take on additional space with firm areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its boutique cosmetics range to increase the availability of products aimed at the vegetarian orientation, which is popular among young buyers at the moment.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume retailer will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in the Croydon area of south London, and the second will open later this year in the Selly Oak area of Birmingham.
Switching to online stores and local shops to buy smaller amounts of food every day means that we have to make more efforts than ever to attract people to supermarkets.
Michael Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, says that the stores are more like department stores, because the supermarket chain is trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores with a large number of services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos stores in hundreds of stores, as well as several Habitats stores after acquiring the Habitats chain two years ago, which it says has increased food sales and improved purchasing efficiency.
The supermarket has failed to restructure its cosmetic and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried to co-brand with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship was broken up due to a dispute over the distribution of profits from its supermarket pharmacy stores.
A new strategy emerged three years ago when Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
It said Lloyds would play a key role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look of our fashion salons to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specialised professionals who can advise you on a regular basis.
Our brands are designed to meet every taste, and the attractive environment and convenient location means we are an attractive destination for beauty that goes against the old fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willowby rejects £ 11 million deal
After TV presenter Holly Willowby cancelled her $11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to cash in on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV, the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is furious.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, his brand of homewear and accessories.
The couple's business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old host posted on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby, in order to make more sense of her big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV, has put the life of Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, in a difficult position, having recently abandoned the successful business of her brand.
Jones said he was "outraged" when media outlets admitted at a tense meeting at the head office in the Marlow area of Buckinghamshire County on Tuesday that a new deal worth £1.5m meant they had no time to promote their brand of homewear and Truly accessories.
This business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby was 37 years old, he took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones flew from the United Kingdom to one of his holiday homes.
What the media said: Truly was not really Holly's idea.
This was the long-term vision he would have seen decades from now.
His decision to quit the game put all the participants in a difficult situation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to being launched.
There is a store full of ready-to-eat items in the head office in Marlow.
Experts believe that the departure of the driver of This Morning, one of the highest paid stars in the UK, could cost the firm millions of dollars due to his huge investment in products ranging from toys and lamps to clothing and home furnishings and the possible delay in its launch.
It can also mean that a long-term friendship has reached its peak.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Johnson and his wife, Tara Kapp, for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend their holidays together and owns 40 percent of Jones Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin, host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, someone close to Jones said, "We don't comment on the farmers' issues related to his business".
We talked for a long time, and then we fell in love.
He was cynical about what some consider to be "unpresidential" comments and criticism from the media for his favorable treatment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so quickly?
Trump said in the funny voice of the news anchor:
I never gave up.
Trump noted that he had intentions for a follow-up meeting after calling his first meeting with Kim in Singapore in June a "big step toward denuclearization of North Korea".
But the denuclearization talks have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that he would not see a "reasonable response" from world leaders to the first step taken by the United States to disarm North Korea.
Instead, the US continued to impose sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump was optimistic in his statement.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea", he said.
We are determined to go to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
We have such a wonderful relationship now.
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results - the completion of missile tests, the release of prisoners and the return of the remaining American military personnel home.
He also defended his unique ways of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded, crowded square, we're going to have 200 people living right there", Trump said, pointing to a group of people standing in front of him.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and earthquake are killing hundreds of people and devastating the island.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs said they did not need help.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of Lombokans had to move, there was no national emergency, no international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they did not seek international help, so there are some difficulties here", Ms. Sambung said.
The "Children's Rescue" team is currently assembling a team to go to Palung, but it is not yet known if foreign workers will be able to work on the ground.
The representative of the National Emergency Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian government is evaluating the situation in Palo to determine whether international agencies can be provided with assistance.
Due to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is not yet ready for the outbreak of nature.
Although the Acheche has been built as a tsunami shelter, it is not accessible to other coastal lines.
Although the warning of the massacre was real, it is possible that the failure of a simple siren warning of the coming tsunami in Palau was the cause.
Even in the calm of the day, travel between the islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship based in Lombok is currently on its way to Paluu to help the victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's broken infrastructure a priority of his pre-election campaign, and he invested in highways and railways.
But Mr. Joko is running for office next year, and his administration is facing a financial crisis.
Mr. Joko was also under pressure from the inter-confessional conflicts in Indonesia, where the Muslim community has chosen a conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslims clashed in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other cold weapons, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing tens of thousands.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores from midfield against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Premier League side Liverpool from Chelsea.
When his team lost 1-0, Sturridge, standing about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, took a pass from Jerdan Shakiri.
He moved the ball to his left foot before he hit.
And the door went upward from the gate, and went toward the right side of the gate, to the top of the gate.
And he passed over the top of Arisa-baalag, and came into the gate.
"It was just an attempt to get in the right position and grab the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to push as far as possible, so I tried to give myself enough time", Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I hit him with one stroke and I didn't mean to, I just hit him.
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the first half, scoring a point in the 25th minute thanks to Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The game was played by the blue jersey striker, Mateo Kovacic, who came from behind and went around the middle of the field to enter the Liverpool field.
Kovačić quickly circumnavigated the obstacle by passing in the middle of the field.
He then allowed Hazard to pass the penalty area and gave the ball well.
Hazard went around the defence, and with his left foot he hit the back of the column, which was a passing shot to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videotron in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The country's emergency agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had reached 832.
The agency spokesman, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, told a press conference that many people were trapped under the collapsed buildings due to the impact of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and the wave of about 20 feet (6 meters) in height.
The city of Palus, with its population of over 380,000, was left without buildings.
After the death of a woman with a cold gun, police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder
An investigation into the murder has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, a suburb of Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 07:55 at the intersection of Trayson Mews and John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked anyone who saw or heard anything in the area to contact them.
Investigator Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is now underway, and we are asking anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us".
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers who might have something written on their videotape, to contact us, because you may have information we need to investigate.
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead district and was found in her home.
And it came to pass at noon that the men that had known her came to inquire of her, saying, Where is this man? and where is he?
The investigation is ongoing, as the police said they were informing the next of kin of the deceased.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews wanted to return to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't know what to say when he knew what was happening.
Residents were told that they would be allowed to enter their homes in a few hours.
One police officer was heard telling a woman that the whole neighborhood was considered a crime scene.
The woman went to the place where the crime was committed, tears in her eyes.
He keeps saying, "This is disgraceful".
Two police buses appeared inside the enclosed area around 2 pm, and another one outside.
Within the enclosed area, several police officers were guarding the multi-storey building.
The information is requested by writing to DM @MerPolCC, calling 101 or calling 0800 555 111 by saying 247 on September 30.
Parliamentary monument of Cromwell remains the last monument to have influenced the process of rewriting history
To violate it would be a fitting punishment for the devastating actions of his fanatical puritan supporters against many of England's cultural and religious values, such as the Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The debate over the demolition of the monument was over the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconic battle of the English Civil War was neither organised nor carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell seems to be getting the unfair punishment for the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thornecroft's brilliant description of Cromwell is a reflection of 19th century thought and part of a historical figure that many people consider to be worthy of admiration.
Mr Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps, more than today, people at the end of the 19th century saw Cromwell as a protector of Parliament from external pressure, and in turn, the monarchy.
The validity of this hypothesis is uncertain, and it is a matter of ongoing debate among historians.
This conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell was a well-known figure who was one of the parties at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered.
Chinese farmer killed by a killer pig
According to local media sources, a pig was allegedly attacked and killed by a farmer at a market in southeastern China.
According to the South China Morning Post, a man named Yuan, known only as Yuan, was found at a market in the city of Lüpanshuai, Guizhou province, near a pigsty, with blood on his body and a liver injury, on Sunday.
In Xinhin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm.
According to reports, he came from the neighboring Yunnan province with his portion to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, some of his followers found him dead at the door of the pig pen.
He said that he saw a large bowl of blood in the pigs' mouths.
According to reports, the court investigation proved that the 550-pound (249 kg) calf attacked the farmer to death.
According to a reporter for The Guiyang Evening News, the room was bleeding and damaged by a section called Vu, which was called .
CCTV cameras show Yuan entering the market to feed pigs around 04:40 on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
And it shall not be his, nor his part, that shall kill a man.
The head of the market told The Evening News that while police were gathering evidence at the crime scene, the pig was locked away to avoid attacking someone else.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market's management are agreeing on compensation for his death.
This is a rare occurrence, but pigs have attacked people in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound (294 kg) Welsh pig was pushed into a tractor and driven away by the farmer's wife.
In 2012, after an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally bad, but the smell of blood can affect them as a stimulant.
They just play.
They're like children, they're very curious ... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them, he said.
The end of Hurricane Rosa brings massive, heavy rainfall to the southeastern United States
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it passes through the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in recent days, the storm Rosa will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At about 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Hurricane Rosa reached a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph (137 km/h), and was 385 miles (619 km) southwest of the Mexican island of Punta Eugenia.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to move north.
At this time, a line of low atmospheric pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. When Storm Rosa reached the bottom of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to move the extreme tropical moisture northward into the southeastern region of the United States.
The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching lower atmospheric pressure line, calling for a large rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Rainfall of 1-4 inches in some areas is likely to cause flooding, flooding and landslides in desert areas.
Severe tropical moisture causes rainfall of up to 2-3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2-4 inches is expected in some parts of the southeast, especially in the populated area of Arizona.
The rapidly changing conditions caused by the widespread rainfall of tropical rainfall can lead to a sudden flood.
When there is a threat of a tropical downpour, you should not go out into the desert on foot.
Rainfall can turn the swamps into a river that washes away the mud, and lightning can bring down winds and dust that melt into some areas.
The approaching low-pressure line will cause heavy rainfall in parts of the southern California coast.
The rainfall of more than half an inch can cause flooding and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the rains in the region after the rains of the winter.
Some tropical rainfall will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and extend into late Monday and Tuesday.
On Saturday, the rains will spread around and continue until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools in October, temperatures can fluctuate dramatically across the United States, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes it causes a sudden change in temperature in nearby areas.
One of the most dramatic temperature changes on Sunday was observed in the central region of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The warm summer sun will return and expand over the next few days.
Early October is expected to be warm across most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, with temperatures expected to be around 80 degrees Celsius from the Southern Plains to the northeastern region.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York City could rise to 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than usual.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts a higher than average temperature for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched on six television channels the persuasive testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazy Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment that occurred around 1980.
Meanwhile, political turmoil erupted when the network was cut off at the last minute of Friday's episode when Arizona Senator Jeff Flake agreed to conduct a weekly impeachment inquiry for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had held him drunk at the university recess and had tried to take his clothes off.
Kavanaugh stood up and swore that he was 100% sure that it hadn't happened.
Nielsen said that more than 20.4 million people could see it on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox news channels and MSNBC.
Numbers for other networks that aired it, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not available at the time.
Nielsen is usually very careful about counting the people he sees in his offices.
In this sense, the number of people who watched the game is the same as the number of people who watched the game of football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News anchors actively supported Kavanaugh's appointment and outscored all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's broadcast.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, there was still a lot of interest.
Flake was the main focus of the drama in Paradise.
When the interest was suppressed, the Republican Party office issued a statement about its intention to vote for Kavanaugh, who was caught on CNN and CBS cameras by the screams of marchers as he entered the elevator on his way to the Law Committee on Friday morning.
He was seen watching the abuse live on CNN, and he stared down for several minutes in pain.
"I'm standing here", said one woman.
And he said unto them, Ye are not the people of the land.
"You have no power over me, since I am a woman without a mother!"
Flake said his office had made a statement and had something to say at the committee hearing before the elevator doors closed.
Cable and broadcast networks showed live broadcast hours late when the Law Committee was about to vote to put Kavanaugh's candidacy to a vote in the entire Senate.
However, I did so because I knew that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would start investigating the allegations against the candidate of the Democratic Party, who was supported by a minority, next week.
Flake was half-convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuhn.
After talking to Kun and then several senators, Flake came to a decision.
Flake's decision worked, because it was clear that Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom May condemned critics for political games on the UK ' s exit from the European Union
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing political games with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the interview that appeared on the front page, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson criticized his so-called "thanks" plan for Britain to leave the EU, saying that the need for Britain and the EU to collect tariffs on each other was "not thought of".
Wade Sims shot: Police arrested Dighton Simpson suspected of killing LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims in a shooting.
Dighton Simpson, 20, was arrested and convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Official sources released a video of Sims and Simpson arguing, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police found the glasses at the scene and claimed that they contained Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wade.
His lawyer announced that he was granted a $350,000 bail.
East Baton Rouge Regional Investigator released a preliminary report Friday, which said the victim was fatally shot in the head, or neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Emergency Police Department, the State Police Criminalistic Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for helping in the search and arrest of the fugitive.
Joe Alleva, head of the LSU sports department, thanked the law enforcement agencies for their diligent work and their commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6 ft 6 in tall forward grew up Baton Rouge, whose father also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was down and outraged by Wade's death.
"You're always worrying about that", Wade said.
A volcanic ash covered Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcanic crater after it woke up, recording 183 gas and ash explosions in 24 hours.
The center noticed many spirals and dumplings.
Videos circulating on social media showed cars in areas such as Sochimilco, Mexico City, with a thin layer of ash covering the windshields.
Geophysicists have observed a slowdown in the activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 km) from the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is named Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested after clashes between pro-independence protesters and police special forces in Barcelona on Saturday, as thousands marched to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on Catalonia's secession that split society in two.
As soon as the police began to withdraw a group of masked separatists, they threw eggs at the police, sprayed powdered paint, and plunged the usually tourist-filled streets into a thick fog.
Later that day, violent clashes broke out with police using their helmets to quell the clash.
For several hours, pro-independence groups who chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" faced the union marchers who shouted "Spain is long gone".
The protest was followed by a medical intervention for 14 people who suffered minor injuries, local media reported.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal and the Catalan separatists celebrated the victory, tensions in the region have not yet subsided.
Voters overwhelmingly supported independence, but the turnout was low as almost all those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan government, last year, police officers were involved in violent clashes during the regional election, which injured about 1,000 people.
The pro-independence groups stayed in the field on Friday to prevent the march in support of the state police.
Although there was a parade, it seems to have been forced to change direction.
Narquis Termez, a 68-year-old electrician, participated in the separatist march with his wife, saying he had lost all hope of Catalan independence.
We had the best time of our lives.
My parents, who had the right to vote, were filled with tears, and now they are fine.
Despite winning the much-anticipated regional vote in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties managed to keep the momentum going this year thanks to their prominent leaders who were either forced into exile or imprisoned pending a court decision for their actions in organizing the referendum and finally declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the march on her phone in support of the police, who were escalating the violence on both sides.
"It's getting worse", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in jail since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament.
"My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to show the decline of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government", he said.
London: Men arrested for hitting a house with a car
In London, men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they crashed into a house several times.
The incident happened in a row of half-moon houses in Ballinagard on Thursday at around 19:30 British Summer Time.
Arresting inspector Bob Blemming reported that damage had been done to the gate and the building itself.
Maybe at some point, the car was shot.
Menga's goal overtakes Rangers, leading to a 1-0 win for Livingston
First goal of Dolly Menga confirmed the victory of Livingston
Livingston, who had risen to the top of the league by one point, led Rangers to a second defeat in 18 games after Stephen Gerrard was appointed manager of the Iberrocks.
Dolly Menga was the exception, because before she could see, Gary Holt's team had tied the score with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win an away match in the Premier League this season, and he faced Hearts, who had been leading the following Sunday, by 8 points.
Rangers had previously met Rapid of Vienna on Thursday at their home ground in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston had held his league record for six games, and Kenny Miller, who took over last month, suffered a bitter defeat to Holt.
Livingston has opened up his opportunities to the audience
Holt's team was in a position to give Rangers a run for their money before they scored.
Scott Robinson was in the lead, but he was caught in the crossfire, and then Alan Lithgow tried his best to catch Craig Halkett's head-on goal.
The organizers were satisfied to watch the Rangers play, knowing that the away team would be in the thick of it as the game progressed.
The decisive goal was scored with exactly this kind of trick.
Rangers sent a penalty kick, and when Livingston was close to scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson approached Mangan, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
At this point, the Rangers were in the lead, but they couldn't get past the strong defense and Liam Kelly was not threatened.
This situation was maintained until the second half, when Alfredo Morelos hit the goalkeeper Kelly.
Scott Pittman was knocked out by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow retaliated in another standard approach from Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was hit with a number of crossed passes, and he was hit so many times, but he was hit twice, once for opposing Halkett Glenn Middleton's replacement and once for hitting the ball with his hand.
Livingston  left a mark   analyze
Alassar Lamont , BBC Scotland , from the Makeroni Arena
Amazing game and result for Livingston.
We thought it was amazing that they went up and there was nothing left.
Their playing style and composition have not changed since their return to the top level, but the top award belongs to Holt, who has been dedicated to the team since his arrival.
I mean, how many heroes are there?
Captain Halkett had a great offensive and outstanding game, and Menga had Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall completely intimidated from start to finish.
The Rangers were exhausted.
It was a vibrating thing in Gerrard's time, and now it seems to have fallen below that.
They sent the final ball, and then they came into contact with the owners, which is what you would expect from the Rangers, who were out of the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a warm welcome in Cologne
The Turkish and German leaders, who met for breakfast in Berlin, were greeted by a warm and open sky on Saturday.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's famous visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations with NATO partners.
They had disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkish citizens living outside Turkey.
Police have barricaded the 25,000-strong crowd outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have begun gathering nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, mostly Kurdish, protested loudly against both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host him.
The guest, who was seen by some German Turks as a pioneer and by others as a dominator, was the source of the conflict.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist in road traffic accident
A cyclist was killed in a traffic accident in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Westwood Street and Evelyn Street in the Deptford area, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 AM British Summer Time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics tried their best, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened just months after the cyclist was killed and the culprit escaped on Saturday, a mile from the scene of the accident.
Officers are identifying the man and alerting relatives, London Police said.
The road is being closed and buses are being diverted, and drivers are being asked not to approach the scene.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during riots
The prison administration reported that six prison officers were injured in the riots in the strictly regulated men's prison.
The riot began at the prestigious Long Lartine Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British Summer Time and has not been reported to the press.
To quell the riots, special Tornado officers were called in and they confined the prisoners in one wing.
Medical assistance was provided to the officers who suffered minor facial injuries at the scene.
A representative of the prison service reported: Special trained prison guards were mobilized to quell the riots taking place in the prestigious Long Lartine prison.
Six injured workers were treated.
We will not tolerate the abuse of our institutions, and we hope that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will stay in prison for a long time.
The prestigious Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison warden was informed that he was being treated in hospital for the assault.
And last October, a special task force of police was called to the prison to quell a huge wave of billiard stones being thrown at the prison guards.
The Rose Falls threaten flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which could have a positive impact on areas affected by drought)
It's hard to believe that a tropical depression has hit Arizona, but it's exactly what's coming next week, with the force of the Rosa Falls sweeping the southwest desert region, bringing torrential rains.
The State Meteorological Service has already launched rainfall flood controls for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona south to eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the rain on Monday evening and head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Service tweeted that since 1950 there have been ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles (321 km) of Phoenix that have maintained tropical storm or depression status!
Katrina (1967) was a flood 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The State Hail Center's forecast for the region is between 2 and 4 inches, with a rainfall of 6 1/2 inches in the Mogollon area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern United States, particularly the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin Mountains, it can reach 1 to 2 inches, and one-half to 4 inches.
The rose rain is a natural gift for areas that are not at risk of flooding, because the region does not tolerate drought.
Although the risk of flooding is high, the lack of rainfall is also a positive effect, because the southwest region is now suffering from drought.
More than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought of the second highest category, according to the US Drought Monitor, weather.com reports.
In its direction, the Rosa Falls first blocks the lower California Plateau in Mexico.
Before it lost strength, Rosa passed 385 miles (619 km) from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) on Sunday morning, heading north at 12 mph (19 km/h).
And he shall be turned into a storm, and his strength shall be turned into the cold waters of the deep.
It is expected to pass over Mexico as a tropical storm late Monday or early Monday.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rains can cause flooding.
"The rainfall will be between 3 and 6 inches, and even 10 inches, from lower California to northwest Sonora", weather.com reported.
After that, Rosa will cover northern Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then passing over Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
The most likely threat from the roses or their trail is heavy rainfall in lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert, the National Flood Information Center said.
The rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening floods and floods in the desert and landslides in the mountains.
Four people arrested in connection with murder in Midsomer Norton
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Sunday, around 04:00 British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area of Avon overnight, Somerset Police said.
The officers asked if anyone had recorded the incident on their mobile phone and would contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the betrayal and anger of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Kavanaugh is a hammer blow to the ruthless and brutal tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Kavanaugh said he suffered from the betrayal and anger of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh made a bold and impressive defense before Congress, denouncing Christine Blaisey Ford's allegations that she had molested her as a teenager decades earlier.
Ford also defended himself at the indictment hearing.
As the president said on Saturday, the Americans saw Kavanaugh's wisdom, character and courage that day.
"Vote for Kavanaugh as a supporter of the most accomplished lawyer of our time, with an impeccable record of public service", he told his West Virginia supporters.
The President described the importance of Republican activism in the midterm elections and indirectly mentioned the candidacy of Kavanaugh.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm in a hurry".
This is why I fight for the good hope everywhere.
Trump said Democrats are "on a path of resistance and obstruction".
The first basic procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, senior assistant head of the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the death toll is rising.
At least 384 people were killed and many more were flooded when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the beaches of Sulawesi, Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
When the waves, up to six meters (18 feet) high, hit the shore when the harbor was closed, hundreds of people gathered for the celebration on the beach in the city of Palo on Friday, many people died and the waves destroyed all those on the way.
The tsunami came after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"People were still on the beach doing their business when the tsunami threat appeared and did not immediately flee and died", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it washed away cars, boats, houses and hit everyone on the mainland", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved at 497 mph (800 km/h) in the open sea before hitting the coastline.
"Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami, and some people survived", he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photos released by the Agency for Disaster Management showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges crumbled and destroyed, and mosques surrounded by water.
After the earthquake, the mud appeared in the city by the river.
The earthquake was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, at the end of a long, shallow bay, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, the report said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings and 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
"More casualties and damage are likely to occur in the area known as Donggala, which is located 190 miles (300 km) north of Palo along the coastline closer to the epicenter of the earthquake", said Nugroho.
According to Nugroho, the communication with Donggala is "completely broken" and there is no information.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there and that its staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it could be worse", the message said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami coming to Palau, although officials said the waves came when a warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man standing on top of a building can be heard shouting loudly to warn people on the street below about an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water would fall to the shore, washing away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage around the city of Palo, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aid by truck planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuees still need food and other essentials.
The city airport is open for emergency services only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in the city of Palo on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia killed more than 800 people.
This is terrible.
According to Mr. Doseba, World Vision employees arrived safely in Palo, where they are staying in the brick shelters installed in the courtyard of the office, where they witnessed the destruction on the way.
And he said, They have told me that they have seen many houses that are in ruins.
This is terrible.
Although aid groups have started a rapid movement to activate the mechanisms of disaster relief, some have complained that experienced foreign aid workers are being prevented from reaching the city of Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the start of foreign funding, material resources and personnel is allowed only if the disaster site has been declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government confirms that this is a national disaster, we can allow international aid, but we don't have that status yet".
Although it was the second night in the city of Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of those who were lost hope that their loved ones will return after the tragic events of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer system.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled the woman out of the rubble, who had been crouching with her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team in paragliding, has recovered two of the missing paragliders who participated in the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"Because I was the leader in paragliding, I had a personal emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that he sent messages via WhatsApp to those attending the beach party in Palo after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the paragliders.
And it came to pass when he sent, that instead of the two blue wings there was one gray wings.
"I think that means that these messages were not sent", he said.
Thieves steal $ 26,750 from a cash machine in Newport , Livy
A Newport Police Department press release said that on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was filling out a cash machine in Newport, Liv.
In the report, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver was preparing to open an ATM in the entertainment complex and deposit extra money.
While he was busy, another man ran after the Brink employee and stole a bag of money for the construction.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants.
Anyone with information about them should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Saturday, she tweeted: "Officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used that nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change came on the eve of her expected release of a new album called Yandhi on Saturday Night Live.
The show's producer says she will replace Ariana Grande, who has declined to appear on the show for "emotional reasons".
While it was a shortened form of his current professional name, West also claimed that the word had a religious meaning to him.
"I think that's the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible, it means 'without,'" West said earlier this year when he was announcing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, he is us.
It came from Canyons, and it represents only one thing, only the good, the bad, the failure, all of us.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the few popular rappers to have changed his name.
Sean Combs was known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, Pee Diddy or Diddy, but this year he chose the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, Jay Z, also used his name with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use military force against civilians
As the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students approaches, the newly elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against the common people.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square never to use military force to stop the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, as leftist student movements were emerging across Latin America, the military opened fire on a peaceful march in a square, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening additional free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are the main reasons why young people join criminal gangs.
US should double funding for AI
Mr. Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China increases its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money spent on research in this area.
The explanations came after some parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, although there is no official strategy on artificial intelligence in the US as a whole.
China announced its plan last year: it aims to become the world leader in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are far behind the United States, doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said doubling funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence being in the United States.
Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order book published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  Li  is the head of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in Face++, one of the most prominent companies in the field of artificial intelligence in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that won the American Grand Otello and later he became managing director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee praised the US government's previous technological races such as the Robotics Challenge by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next race would be to help identify the next visionaries.
Mr. Lee said that researchers in the United States have to work hard to win government grants.
"It's the corporations that are taking away the academic excellence, not China", Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have attracted prominent scientists from universities to work on AI.
Mr. Lee said that changing immigration policy could improve his research on artificial intelligence in the United States.
"I think that the green cards for PhDs in artificial intelligence should be automatically granted", he said.
The Chinese State Council published a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
"The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation now invests more than $100 million annually in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
The US legislation that attempted to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence failed for months.
Macedonians vote on changing the name of the country in referendum
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which could allow the EU and NATO to resolve a long-running dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid for membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, vetoed its neighbor in the north for joining NATO and the European Union, citing its name as a claim to its territory.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that this change may violate the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Georgi Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about the presence of a minimum of 50 percent of voters required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Do you support the agreement with Greece and membership in NATO and the European Union?"
Supporters of the change of the country's name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider it the right decision for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia to join the European Union and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, for their chance to live freely in the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old resident of Skopje.
Although the law is not yet in force, a sufficient number of parliamentarians said they would support it to clarify the outcome of the vote.
The name change needs the support of two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission reported that there were no reports of violations of the rules until 1 pm .
However, the turnout of registered voters was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% voted.
"I came here to vote for my children, we should be in Europe", said 62-year-old José Tannewski, a voter from Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 for a referendum on changing the name of the country in Macedonia, which would allow for NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by the people who were announcing the boycott of the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the European Union, but we don't want to enter through the official door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have hope.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and join the Europe-Asia integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will bring necessary investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will support us, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that the outcome of the yes vote will be a guarantee for our future.
According to a poll published by the Institute of Political Studies on Monday, 30-43% of voters participated in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
The referendum will be held in the capital of the country, and the turnout will be 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum is the first blow to the policy of the Western government that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City ' s Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defence of Brighton City and approaches the goal
In the 2-0 win against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly broke the defence of Brighton.
Aguero did it in a funny way at the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field when the combination started.
He ran through three Brighton club defenders before moving onto the pitch.
Aguero then stood among the four players in the blue shirts.
He passed a defender, then several other players on the edge of the Brighton field.
And then he passed to Sterling on the left.
The English striker hit the ball first in the penalty area and returned it to Aguero, who then threw his right foot towards Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and hit the right side of the net.
Aguero has a slight injury to his leg, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
He scored a goal in that time and we were on our way.
However, in the Premier League, the blue shirts were given the upper hand by the same Sterling.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball in the same game in Brighton.
He gave Leroy Sane a nice pass with that.
Sane touched the ball several times before sending Sterling to the far end.
The blue-shirt forward threw the ball into the net before he could leave the edge of the field.
On Tuesday at 12:55 pm, Manchester City will play against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rokiz as a point-taker
After the "Nationals" were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to rush the next start.
However, the ever-active Scherzer is hoping to pass the ball on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but still only in the event of a playoff loss to the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies won the Wild Card early on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but are still trying to secure their first division title.
We're just playing the chorus, but at least we can get into the game knowing that there's going to be an atmosphere where the people here in Denver and the team playing at the highest level this year are going to be.
Why don't I want to race here?
The Nationals will announce the starter for Sunday's game, but it looks like this will allow Scherzer to pass the ball.
Scherzer, who made his 34th start, trained on Thursday at the pitcher's mound and delivered the ball in his normal condition on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
When the president spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, he indirectly referred to the situation with Brett Kavanaugh when he chose the Supreme Court.
Everything we do is decided in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, and I'm not just running, but I'm really running, so I'm running for good candidates everywhere, he said.
Trump continued: "You're seeing this awful group of radical Democrats, you're seeing this happening right now.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary, and you see the evil, the abomination.
They don't care who they insult, who they oppress in order to take power and control, which is what they need, and we're not going to give it to them.
He said that the goal of the Democrats is to "resist and obstruct".
"You've seen this over the last four days", he said, and he called the Democrats "angry, evil, negative and hypocritical".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee that had exposed Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, and there was a huge outcry from the audience.
Do you remember what he said?
Do you want to share the document?
No, no, what.
No, no, I was expecting someone. It was really bad sign language. It was the worst sign language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
He is intolerant of those who openly express their opinions
It was no surprise when activists from my local Momentum party voted to impeach me.
After all, I am the last Labour MP to say we don't have a voice, because we all have a voice.
That's how I treated my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was so strongly anti-Semitic.
In my case, the blame movement tried to test me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
There were similar issues in Europe, about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting announcement said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the BC meetings on Friday nights were just like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the norm at many meetings today, and the promise of a "more gentle, more lenient" policy, if it was ever so common, has long been forgotten.
In the Labour Party, it is becoming clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated and that each opinion is judged on its suitability for the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, and I was pushed back by colleagues who previously thought we had similar political views, and expected me to take positions that I would never agree on, whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public, and no matter what I say, there are words on social media that call for rejection of the election, condemnation of the policies of the centre, and insults that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one.
In fact, I know I've been more informed than some of my colleagues, because the opinions that are directed at me are usually political.
I appreciate the professionalism and courage of my colleagues who are sexually or racially abused every day but don't hide it.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how the levels of corruption have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needs to develop a culture of resilience.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views and the party is being limited by expressing disbelief or changing the rules of the election.
Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice about not lifting my head, not being active, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
I was inspired by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which left my school classroom in a state of total disrepair, and since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, I have tried to support the highest level of public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have misunderstood my political positions and my disagreement with the current leadership.
All I'm going to say to those who supported this movement on Friday is that I don't see the need to spend time and effort on being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party as we head into a Brexit that will hurt our households, institutions and public services.
My only appeal is not to the Nottingham Momentum movement, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that the possibility of my being rejected or any political expediency will not prevent me from acting in the way I believe is best for the interests of all of you.

Air 38  17 Melrose: Unbeaten Air has won the first place
Two late attempts slightly ruined the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to win in this very exciting match of the Tennant Premier League.
They are now in the undefeated tenth and at the head of the table.
In the end, their excellent defense, as well as their good use of opportunity, won the fielders and coach Peter Merchi had every opportunity to be pleased.
"So far, we have passed the test through our games and we have not lost yet, so I should be happy", he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "We should give the Air Club a credit, they've used their opportunities better than we have".
A 14-minute move by Grant Anderson, performed by Fraser Clim, gave Air a lead, but the yellow paper given to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score and Jason Baggott received the unplaced move.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, in the middle of the game, he scored, then he played a solo at half-time to try to make the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well and an action by Baggott's Patrick Anderson reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruad Knott, who was taken to the ground and after the game resumed, Air Club went further ahead through the action of Stafford McDowell, played by Climo.
Then acting Air Club captain Blair MacPherson was shown a yellow card and Melrose paid back the extra man for the late-season period with an unfulfilled act by Bruce Colvin.
However, the owners came to them and when Struan showed Hutchinson the yellow card for holding the ballless Climax, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line, behind Eyre's cross near the ball.
After Kyle Rowe took a penalty kick from David Armstrong and sent out flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt by the owners, Climo did as he had done since the restart.
Still Game star is planning a new career in the restaurant industry
After being appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company, the star of the series Still Game, Ford Kearney, is about to move into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old actor will play Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series of the show and it seems that Kiernan is planning her life after Craiglang.
According to official documents , he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited .
The actor declined to comment on the incident, although the Scottish Sun reported that Kirnan was planning to work in the luxury restaurant industry in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia , without access to the sea , hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River, the naval bases have a slogan: "By law, the sea is ours".
It is our duty to take it back.
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still the memory of the coast that was crossed to Chile in the 19th century conflict over resources and the desire to sail the Pacific again.
This hope may have reached its peak in the last decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of aspiration, unity and peace and it certainly expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's demand that Chile negotiate an independent access to the sea for Bolivia after decades of tense negotiations.
Monday's ruling is also significant for Evo Morales, Bolivia's exceptionally charismatic indigenous president, who is in contention for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts said it was doubtful that the court would rule in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, we believe it would have little impact on the outcome of the case.
The UN mission in the Netherlands said it was not authorized to support Chile's territory and could not decide the outcome of the negotiations.
The UN International Court of Justice ruling, which will be issued within six months of the final hearing, proves that the case is not as shrewd as it seems, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And Bolivia is not going to be done, it seems to have been pushed back four years.
"The issue of the right to navigate is being illegally used by the current Bolivian leadership", Zarate said.
He speculated that Morales' bellicose statements would undermine the rest of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will have a conversation sooner or later, and then it will be difficult to get into a debate.
The two countries have not sent an ambassador since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, disagreed with the opinion that the court's speedy decision would raise suspicions.
He said Monday would be a unique moment for Bolivia to open a new era of relations with Chile and bring an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict in mutual benefit.
Calzadilla, one of Latin America's most famous presidents, also disapproved of Morales' use of maritime issues as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean".
Afterglow is a sign that you need to forget the past.
North Korea says it will not denuclearize if it doesn't trust the US
North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong Ho said that if the people can't trust Washington, they will never allow nuclear disarmament.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United Nations to keep its promise at the summit with the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
He began his remarks when he saw that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was ready to reopen the nuclear diplomacy issue that had stalled North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when he met him in Singapore more than three months later.
Ri said that the US refusal to make an official declaration of the end of the Korean War and the mass-produced influence would not bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of making an official statement until Pyongyang is the first to make a massive disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump have said that a second summit is needed.
However, there is a doubt that the country may not accept Pyongyang's complete renunciation of weapons as the only way to maintain security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month as part of the second Kim-Trump summit.
The headgear that was on display at the Paris Fashion Show is a long way off, and it's going to be available to you soon.
If you say I'm going to enlarge my fancy hats or hide in the sun, you don't have to look.
Designers such as Valentino and Tom Brown have steadily shown off the podium of unconventional curly-haired headwear in their 2019 summer collections, going beyond the usual theme of Paris Fashion Week.
The most popular hats have been on Instagram this summer, with famous designers putting their eye-catching pieces on the podium.
Valentino's signature piece was a large white-yellow cap with a wide brim, embroidered with feathers, which was invisible even under the fashionistas who wore it.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-covered turnips, a witch's helmet, and even pineapples, but they are not designed to be worn in the prime of the year.
Tom Brown also came up with a collection of unusual masks, something that would be unusual for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn with fleeces, not high fashion, but looked like Hannibal Lecter.
One was like a scuba diver's suit with a breathing tube and swimming goggles, and the other was like a horn jar of melted ice cream.
If you're a regular fashion evaluator, this is your moment.
And the art experts say that it's very possible that you'll find women's hats on the street.
The over-globalized hats were followed by a two-foot wide-brimmed cotton hat called La Bomba, worn by one of the two, from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
After the rubbish hat that captured social networks, that made the country a god, another creature came to the podium  a straw bag that held it on the beach, the same one that the swimsuit of the fashion designer who caught it.
The bag, made of yellowish-red raffia fiber with raffia beads and white leather handle, was featured in the summer collection of Jacques La Rivera 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect that next summer, larger hats and beach bags will be available to the general public, because after the huge impact that the designer has left, large-sized accessories should not be overlooked".
John Edward: Language is important for the citizens of the world
Private schools in Scotland have maintained high standards of teaching, with high performance in examinations in 2018, and individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other collective activities, continuing this trend.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland itself, the private schools, which operate on behalf of the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide a high standard of service to both pupils and their parents.
Private schools prepare their students to further their studies, get higher education, achieve their chosen career and become global citizens.
As an education sector that can develop and implement a unique school curriculum, we see modern languages emerging as a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, you will get the message.
If you speak to him in his native language, it reaches your heart.
It's a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
As the results of the recent exams this year show, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest achievement rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got a high A.
According to the data provided by 74 SCIS representative schools, 72% of students received A grades in Chinese, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language learning as a necessary skill for children and young people that will definitely be needed in the future.
Among the subjects selected in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere, languages are given equal importance with the exact sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Vocational Training Commission found that 17 percent of job rejections were due to low language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for future careers.
In the context of job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
When a person chooses a second language in any career, he or she has more opportunities to use these skills in the long term.
The ability to interact directly with people from a foreign country puts a person who knows several languages above the others.
According to YouGov, in 2013, the number of adults who spoke English but could not converse in another language was over 4,000 (75 percent), while those who could only speak French as a second language was double-digit, 15 percent.
So, we need to be careful about teaching languages to children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, increases the chances of children finding effective employment.
In Scotland, each school is different in the languages it teaches.
One school teaches a bit of classical modern languages, and another teaches Chinese or Japanese, which is very important for the UK in 2020.
No matter what your child is interested in, private schools will have a choice of languages, and the teachers are considered experts in this field.
Scottish private schools prepare children to succeed in whatever the future holds and develop the skills to do so.
In the global business environment, we cannot deny that languages are very important for the future of a country, and we must introduce this requirement in education.
But we should really think of modern languages as skills for interacting on an international level.
Private schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland the same choice, diversity and quality of education.
So be it (in French).
John Edward Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
Lebron will debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The fans who were waiting for him to make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers were eagerly awaited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Denver Nuggets in the season opener in San Diego on Sunday.
We'll see how many minutes he can play.
"More than one, less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Traddell tweeted that James could only play for a limited amount of minutes.
After practice this week, they asked James for his opinion on the Lakers' six-game season schedule.
He said, 'At this point in my career, I don't need any seasonal games to train.'
Trump's election campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is scheduled to begin a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five planned Trump summits this week, counting stops to such collaborative locations as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for confirmation of his nominee for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump will increase his support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing Congressional support in November's vote.
What time does Trump's pre-election rally start in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's pre-election rally is expected to begin at 7:00 p.m. eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018, in Wheeling, West Virginia.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube by clicking on the link below.
Trump will speak about the hearings this week of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is hotly debated for delaying the Senate vote on his sexual assault charges by a week before the FBI investigations are complete.
But the main goal of this pre-election campaign is to help the Republicans consolidate their position before the November elections.
So the five meetings President Trump is planning for next week are a "boost to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and increase their majority vote in the Senate and lower chambers of Congress", reports Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is a very important task on his agenda, so the president is trying to travel to as many states as possible before the start of the general election season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The rally, which will be held at the West Bank Arena in Wheeling, will likely be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will certainly get the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is Trump's second visit to West Virginia since last month, which he won in 2016 with 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the vote.
"It's not a good sign for Mauritius that the president himself is here to boost his voting spirit", said Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight for victory ahead of Sunday ' s individual games
After three of the four knockout rounds, the four who played again on Saturday afternoon went on to win the Ryder Cup.
The pace of the pendulum swing is a pure form of sport, but the athletes put great hope in it, especially in competitions like this.
The question is, where is this momentum now?
"They were ahead by six points, now four, and I think we're coming up a little bit faster", said Jordan Spit as he walked back that day.
Europe, which is winning by four points, is definitely ahead.
Speight said that the Americans were still undefeated, but there were many encouraging moments, especially when they played together throughout the day and each of them got three points from four.
The pitch is not in front of the pitch from the ball's width and can be a model for himself.
When Thomas and I played a double-double in the fourth, they hit the hole and when the fourth was tied, the victory cries from the crowd were heard.
His game-winning shot at the hole was met with exactly this kind of applause at the 15th minute, a sign that the Americans were not yet lost.
"You should be all eager and focused on your party", said Spit.
All the players mentioned are currently out of the game.
18 holes are allocated.
The two players who have outscored Spit and Tommas in the last two days - Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood - will undoubtedly be in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but attractive couple is the four of four who never make a date.
The only Hollywood couple didn't bogey again on Saturday afternoon, they refused to bogey again on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning on the last nine holes of the hole course.
That cut and the energy exchange with the unrestrained crowd established them as the Sunday winners, Le Golf National was born on a day when it was more than Fleetwood or Molinari, and showed that there were no other famous players to defend the European title.
Both of them should fall into different holes.
The stories of the glory of Europe are being told, how quickly and how quickly.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson paired up with Alex Noren in the morning game, and were eliminated by Sergio Garcia, who was named the four-ball batter.
Boggy and two double strokes in the first half of the game led the Spaniard and the Swede to the second hole, but they were stuck.
But it seems that there is no one to help you get out of the hole on Sunday.
Four-ball hits and fours are worth taking a closer look at because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and their perception of the sudden change in strategy.
Europe has played better as a group so far, and as they headed to the final with confidence, although some, especially in the states, were skeptical, this quartet showed that the US team was ready to fight for victory.
Europe reached the final of Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will not be playing well in the Ryder Cup final after beating the United States 10-6 after four ball strikes and four-match draws on Saturday.
The amazing Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari paired up to beat Tiger Woods by two wins and reached Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Björn's European side, determined to win back the trophy they had lost in Hazeltin for two years, beat the Americans 3-1 in the morning with four balls.
The USA had better hopes for the fours, who won two matches, but they were unsuccessful due to lack of points.
Jim Furyk was eight points short of a win in Sunday's 12 individual matches.
Fleetwood became the first European junior player to score four consecutive points, and Molinari and Moliwood destroyed the pair and became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four matches of the opening season after a disastrous Sunday.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed by four strokes, they put on a great joint play to knock out Woods and young American player Bryson Deschambon by 5 and 4 in the next leg.
Although Woods, who pulled himself out of two matches on Saturday, has shown some remarkable moments, he is now seventh on the list, having lost four balls and four games in 19 of 29 matches.
Justin Rose, breathing in the morning's four-ball strikes, returned with his teammate Henrik Stenson in the fours, and knocked out Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked first and third in the world, by 2-1.
Europe was watching all this in a comfortable, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a new record by scoring two points for the Americans on Sunday.
They beat Spaniards John Ram and Jan Poulter 2-1 on four balls and later came back to beat two-hole Poulter and Rory McAiro 4-3 in the quarter-finals.
It was only the second time in Ryder Cup history that the ball returned from a four-point deficit to a single game, but the fans were with Furyk just to win back.
After two days of being second best, how many of them seem to be behind after the counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is impossible without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing crackdown on the United States would increase mistrust of the country and make it impossible for the country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "considerably good measures" including halting nuclear and missile weapons tests, closing the nuclear test site, and promising to not proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't get anything from the United States".
"If we don't trust the United States, we're also threatening our national security, so don't think that we're the first to start unilateral disarmament".
While Ri repeated Washington's public protest against the "temporary" disarmament method, which North Korea is expected to take due account of its gradual actions, his statement also denied that Pyongyang had previously accepted unilateral disarmament without consideration.
At the first summit between the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, Ri advanced a joint statement between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, in which Kim promised to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, while Trump promised to maintain North Korea's security.
Although North Korea wanted to formally end the war in 1950-53, the United States insisted that it should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is increasing pressure to achieve its goal by force, through sanctions and by refusing to declare the end of the war", Ri said.
"The idea that we can be defeated by sanctions is an unrealistic dream for those who don't know about us".
But the continuation of sanctions is weakening our faith.
Ri did not say anything about the US leader's plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which he had previously spoken about at the UN.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying that if the other side of the issue was South Korea, not the United States, then the Korean peninsula would not be so impassable.
However, Ri's voice is not as strong as last year, when Ri said at the UN General Assembly that "the devil president Mr. Trump" referred to Kim as "the astronaut on the death mission" and that this led to the launch of missiles in North Korea on US soil.
Trump, who last year vowed to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in implementing disarmament measures this year, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea was nuclear-decommissioned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he would not put a time limit on it, saying that "it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that until a complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved, sanctions must be actively and compulsively maintained.
In order to stabilize Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the Security Council unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in 2006.
Pompeo said he would meet informally with the UN General Assembly in Rome and return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said that the case was progressing, but soon North Korea accused him of imposing gangster demands.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would dismantle its missile complex as well as its nuclear complex if the US took "reasonable measures".
He said Kim had called the "parametric measures" he was seeking security guarantees from Trump in Singapore and that he was aiming to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students taking a course on getting enough rest
To combat the caffeine-induced macho culture of studying all night, Harvard University started a course this year that encourages all students to sleep more.
The academic number one university found that students didn't know how to expect.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course and said that this had never happened before in the United States.
She wanted to start this course after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"After I finished, a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I only hear this in high school?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which first launched this year, provides key insights into how good sleep skills can help with academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, says that the university decided to introduce the course after learning about the lack of sleep among students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of several interactive tasks.
One of these chapters is a picture of a dorm room, where students are shown pressing coffee mugs, curtains, sleeping bags, and books, and they are told about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of bedtime.
In another section, participants reported that prolonged sleep bleeding increased their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map with interactive signs will prompt participants to think about their daily lives.
We know that this will not change the lives of students immediately.
But they have a right to know, just like you have a right to know about the health risks of smoking, " Professor Chase added.
He said that the culture of pride in not sleeping through the night still exists, and modern technology and the pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
He says that getting enough sleep should be the secret weapon of the student against stress, boredom and anxiety, and it should prevent him from gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a fasting mode, causing it to be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Chase develop the course, and he took one of Chase's classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
She says that this course opened her eyes and inspired her to spread it throughout the campus.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to go through a similar curriculum before they get into a highly competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler advises students to set a wake-up clock to fall asleep, wake up from sleep, and learn about the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and light-emitting diodes (which disrupts your circadian rhythm and causes difficulty falling asleep).
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: Menga Gerard ' s boys scored the goal
The Rangers suffered another setback at the hotel, as Dolly Menga's shot defeated Steven Gerrard's stunning 1-0 home run at Livingston.
Although Ibrox were looking to win their first away game after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, Gary Holt's team only managed to bring him a second defeat in 18 games as Gerrard's manager, resulting in Ladbrokes falling eight points behind Premier League leaders Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and it seems that the Rangers had no incentive to even the score.
Rangers dropped to sixth, while Livingston moved up to third, again only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
After line umpire Calum Spence injured his head with a long-range throw, the Rangers could have had additional problems.
Gerrard made eight changes to the pitch, which led him to the semi-finals of the Off-Aire Bethfred Cup.
On the one hand, Holt came out with a Levy 11 after scoring from Hart last week, and he would have been very happy that his well-trained squad had defeated the opponent.
Although the Rangers had more possession of the ball, Livingston used what was available more effectively.
They forced Scott Pittman to score a goal for Allan McGregor in the first edition of the manga, but the midfielder did not miss his chance.
Keegan Jacobs' deep penalty shot reached team captain Craig Hulket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit hard from behind.
Although the Rangers were in control, there was more hope than confidence in the last third of the game.
After a quarter of an hour, Alfredo Morelos believed he had a chance to score a penalty because he had already clashed with Steven Lawless, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers scored two runs in the first inning, but it was not difficult for Liam Kelly, former goalkeeper of Ibrox, to get the attack from Lassanha Coulibaly and Ovi Edjaria.
Although Levi's start in the 34th minute was against the game, no one doubts that they deserved it for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't do anything about Jacobs' deep hit.
Scott Arfield did not take any action, because Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to send it to Manga to finish the game.
Gerrard intervened during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, a change that had an immediate impact. Although Winger overcame Morelos's opposition, Kelly blocked him from his own line.
But Livingston kept the guests in their own game, and Lithgow and Halkett held the ball for a long time.
Although Holt's side maintained a long lead in the final stages, Litgow managed to counter McGregor Jacobs before he launched a wide-angle attack.
The Rangers' rookie Glenn Middleton had a run-in with Jacobs and demanded another penalty, but Thompson again ignored it.
The Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the Sunday Morning Almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, and in the same year ... in Germany, the future physicist Hans Wilhelm Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later became known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Corona Bells", with the usual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's common?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are given by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "It's going to be known now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, shortly after his 63rd birthday.
But his invention still lives.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to see defective cells
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to detect and kill defective cells
The vaccine will teach the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method consists of taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
And then they can see the protein that's common to many cancers, and they can re-insert it.
The trial vaccine has shown good results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that trained her immune system to see defective cells lost her cervical cancer within 18 months.
The method consists of taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the lab so that he can see a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2 and re-insert them.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that vaccines have a future".
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 "increases the growth of several types of cancer" (including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer).
Taking immune cells from patients, teaching them how to interact with cancer cells, helped cure leukemia.
Kanje showed up on SNL wearing a MAGA cap to show his support for Trump.
Failed to complete
Kanye West was widely criticized after he praised US President Donald Trump on the Saturday Night Show and announced that he would run for the office in 2020.
After singing her third song, "Bring America Back to Greatness", which she wore with her cap on, she spoke out against Democrats and confirmed her support for Trump.
"I talk to white people a lot, and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's racist?'
Okay, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
The SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, who mocked Brett Kavanagh's response to the Senate Judiciary Committee's report on the sexual assault of Christina Blasey Ford.
Although Wes's remarks were not televised, a video of him was posted by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with his post.
West also told her that she found it difficult to wear the headdress on stage.
"They tried to intimidate me outside the stage.
"Don't put your head down!"
They scared me!
They said I was in a " lost " place .
West continues, "You want to see the flooded earth, so I'm going to wear Superman's costume, because you can't tell me what to do.
Start with love".
His speech was snubbed at least twice by the audience, and the cast of SNL appeared to be manipulated. According to one witness to Variety, "The whole studio was silent".
West's former lover Mac Miller had replaced Ariande Grande, who had died a few days earlier.
It was not understood by many that Wes was dressed like a Perrier bottle and sang I Love it.
West was supported by Candice Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "Thank you to one of the bravest people: FOR STANDING UP TO THE MAFIA".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Wes stayed true to himself and that it was amazing.
But I prefer not to praise anyone who promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art).
He is free.
We are, too", he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on his Twitter that he had officially changed his name to Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following in the footsteps of Diddy, who was once known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lian, and of course Prince, who later became a music legend, changed his name to a symbol and became famous by that name.
Accused of hate crime in connection with the rape of a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballihakamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Conciliation Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the State Prosecutor's Office .
The star of the TV show " Sex and the City " , Keith Harington , has expressed his opposition to the " male " attitude of the women .
Keith Harington is best known for his role as John Snow, the swordsman in the HBO crime-thriller series The Clash.
But the 31-year-old actor has broken the stereotype of a macho character, saying that he thinks that such roles on screen have to be ugly for young children to feel respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said something was wrong with him and raised the issue of how to deal with male-dominated behavior in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently appeared on the series "The Matter of the Clothes" with Rose Leslie, 31, said he feels "very strong" about the issue.
"I feel stronger myself. What have we done wrong with our masculinity?" he said.
What have we taught people about the current state of the world?
Keith believes that television may be responsible for the rise of male-dominated male behavior due to the presence of overly masculine characters.
And he said, When shall these things be born? and what shall they teach?
What are young children being taught on TV and on the street to think that this is what a real man should be?
I think this is one of the biggest issues of our time, and how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that something is wrong with the younger kids.
In an interview, he said that after the series ended the following year, there would be no "Clash of Clans" prequels or sequels, because he was completely addicted to battles and horses.
From November, Keith will be working on a film about Sam Shepard, a film producer, and his robber brother, called True Western.
The actor considers his meeting with his wife Rose the most beautiful event that has ever happened in the "Tags" world.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future child and my new life from this moment", he says.
Rose plays the favorite of John Snow, a character played by Keith, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in HIV/AIDS cases.
According to official health officials, this amounts to 820,000 people in the country.
40 000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
What's different is that most of the new events are about sex.
HIV was commonly transmitted in China through transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said that such cases are now almost rare.
But every year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a topical issue in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been criminalized in China since 1997, discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
Because the country is conservative, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The disease is most often transmitted by improper protection during sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, China has promised to make HIV drugs available to the public to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees have been exposed by Republican Party senators, and theories of "dangerous lies" and "deceptive actions" are being developed.
U.S. Republican Party spokesperson Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that her staff had leaked the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators to lawmakers on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the accusations were fabricated by the website's "ultra-right" experts.
"Lies, lies and beyond lies", Waters tweeted.
The leaked information included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch.
The information leaked online on Thursday and was made public by an unknown person at the Capitol during Senate hearings on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators investigated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState claim that the IP address that identifies the source of the message is associated with Waters &amp; apos; office and that the information was released by one of Waters &amp; apos; employees (Hill).
"This unfounded statement is completely false and absolutely false", Waters continues.
None of my employees whose privacy and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false statements is responsible for the dissemination of this information.
 This unfounded statement is completely false and absolutely false
Waters's statement was widely criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This denial was made in a rage", writes Fleischer.
That means that his character is not fit to be a member of Congress.
If a man is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It shouldn't be a big deal.
They must not question the accusers' motives.
They have to stay balanced".
Fleischer's reaction to Waters's comments appeared to be compared to Kavanaugh's, who was accused by critics of being too angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, who is running for the Republican primary to replace Waters, also tweeted his thoughts.
"If true, then big , ", he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said his office had "warned the relevant government and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent complaints".
"We will get the criminals to come out, "he continued, "and they will be held accountable for the dangerous actions they have inflicted on each of my employees".
Johnny English is back  Rowan Atkinson 's silent spy
Now, I'm looking for signs of Brexit in new films that traditionally feature British people, and this is clearly also the case with the revival of the Johnny English franchise, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is our satire about our futility a new export opportunity for our country?
Anyway, the grumpy, rubber-faced, unruly Johnny English gets a second chance to play, which means his comedy is dedicated to non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
He certainly has a sense of humour, but he's got a little bit of Clovis, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the guy who contributed to the chariots of fire melody at the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony.
It was originally based on the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial about the adventurer and mystery soul international Atkinson, who had created a world of his own.
There's a couple of good things about the last round of GI.
I love that Johnny English comes in a helicopter with a medieval suit and the rotor pads are all over his headdress.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown, but the humor seems weak and excessive, as 007 and the "Mission Impossible" itself are saturated with comedic moments.
I think that the experiences of Johnny English are not as interesting and collected as the Bean-style jokes of Atkinson.
A constant prerequisite  to show that the UK has big issues at hand.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates a top-secret network of British spies, exposing the identities of British agents working in various locations, and scaring the on-duty agent (unfortunately Kevin Eldon's role is small).
The patience of the arrogant and unyielding prime minister, who suffered from the loss of his political prestige, was exhausted: Emma Thompson did everything for her quasi-Theresa-May character, but could not get beyond the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that all the spies were public, and he would now have to recall those who had resigned.
That means Johnny English, the unsub who now teaches at a top-notch school but gives informal classes on how to be a top-secret operative: there's some good jokes here too, because the English School offers a spy academy in the style of "Rock School".
The Englishman returned to Whitehall for urgent instruction and rejoined Buff (also Ben Miller), who had suffered much.
Buffy is a married man who is subservient to the captain of a submarine.
Batman and Robin, who are both very curious, return to the secret service of Her Majesty and meet the beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
The prime minister, who claims to be the man who solves the computer problems of Britain, is now in the arms of Jason Volta (played by Jake Lacey).
English and Buff begin their odyssey of strange jokes: disguised as a tailor, they set fire to a French restaurant; secretly break into Volta's luxury yacht and destroy it; and English explores the surroundings to use a virtual reality headset to get inside Volta's house.
All this is done for the final series, but the overly noisy action is like children's TV.
The middle world.
I was looking at other Johnny English films and wondering if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that matched her talent.
Labour thinks it's too radical for the British to work four days and get five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party thinks it's too radical for the British to take four days of work and five days of pay.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to give employees extra time off as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution.
And they were to give the workers three days' rest, and their wages as usual.
According to sources, the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and the plan to turn the country in the interests of the workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved at a trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week  will be considered as an attempt to rebalance the economy in the workers' favor, as well as in line with the general production strategy of the party.
The Green Party was the first to support the idea, not the Labour Party, which adopted a four-day work week in the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party's ambitions are not yet fully confirmed.
Labour Party spokesman: Four-day work week is not party policy, it is not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell devoted last week's Labour conference to predicting a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that the decision was made to return the power of the "neutral directors" and "speculators" in public utilities firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plan means that the existing shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their shares, because the Labour party is likely to make "withdrawals" based on its actions against the proposed law.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund, which would see employees receive a 10 percent share of private sector capital and receive a dividend of £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, in 60 minutes, said that the FBI investigation of the Kavanaugh case had changed their minds.
The FBI investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the decisive vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's decision could force Republican senators to support him.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find a reason to change their minds.
Kennedy preferred to be more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, I think so", Kennedy said.
"I said that, I said that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh on the way to the court.
And it came to pass after this, when the judgment was come, that I spoke to him, and said, Is this what thou hast done?
He was courageous, perseverant and did not hesitate.
But Graham made a very good decision.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is clear and I need a strong case to charge him", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett refused to admit it", Graham added in response to Blaisey Ford.
But they could not prove his testimony.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't notice any change from that.
What is the significance of the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring some of the biggest stars in the world who have a goal of ending poverty in the world.
To mark the seventh anniversary of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will not only see the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes on the huge Central Park square, but also participate in raising awareness about the goal of ending poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international human rights organization that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket, of course), listeners must volunteer, write a letter to a world leader, make a phone call, or do a number of other important tasks or tasks aimed at raising awareness about the goal of eradicating poverty.
But just 12 years before the goal was reached, how successful was Global Citizen?
Is the real way to get free concerts to the public is to make it mandatory to call people to action, or is it just another example of clique-ism -- the belief that people can make a real difference by signing online petitions or tweeting?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, the organization has organized more than 19 million events with the help of supporters for various purposes.
They said that these actions have motivated world leaders to announce commitments and demands worth more than $37 billion, affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported on 390 tasks and announcements resulting from organized events, and of which at least 10 billion dollars were raised or spent.
The group defines the provision of funds as directly affecting the lives of 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key objectives is the Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of British investors and executives that aims to help children reach their full potential by pledging $35 million to Rwanda to tackle food shortages in the region after collecting 4,700 tweets on behalf of Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, we can make a historic reference to the social injustice of malnutrition", said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
In addition, according to the organisation, more than 5,000 events have been organised in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, and the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition, which involves nearly 5 million women and children.
The question that is asked in the list of AIDS on their website is: Why are we so sure that we will win the war against poverty?
Global citizen responded: "It's going to be a very long and difficult journey, sometimes we'll fall and sometimes we'll fail".
But like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
This year, the New York City concert, organized by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman, will feature such stars as Janet Jackson, Wickend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monet.
US will seek help from the Navy to block Russian energy exports , Minister of Internal Affairs said
According to the Washington Examiner, the US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that Washington will use the Navy if necessary to prevent the introduction of Russian energy into the market, including the Middle East.
According to Zinké, Russia's intervention in the Syrian issue, including acting on the call of the legitimate government, is the beginning of the exploration of a new energy market.
"I believe that their goal of acting in the Middle East stems from the need to find an energy broker, as in the case of Eastern Europe and the southern belt of Europe", he said in his speech.
The authorities also claim that there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability to do this with the help of the Navy, which means opening the sea lanes, or, if necessary, preventing Russian energy from entering the market", he said.
Zinké dedicated this speech to the participants of the event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance and the non-profit organization that proclaims itself as the Voice of the Energy Consumers of the United States.
He then compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, which means that they are practically the same.
"The economic issue with Russia and Iran is not beyond the issue of fuel efficiency and fuel replacement", he said, describing Russia as a "limited-action transport" that is economically dependent on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has been reported to have achieved the goal of accelerating the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and selling it to European consumers at a cheaper price, emphasizing Russia.
That's why Trump administration officials, and US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to abandon a "no-go" pipeline project like Nord Stream 2, which Trump believes will make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has proved that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of 110 billion cubic meters of pipeline, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin has said that Washington's opposition to the project is based on economic reasons and is a model of unfair competition.
" I am convinced that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that we share the view on the right of consumers to choose producers , " Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September .
Germany objected to this position of the United States and confirmed its unwavering position on the project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has requested that the US not interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"We are very uncomfortable with the interference of third parties in our energy supply process", said the head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) Dieter Kempf after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren says she has "close control" of the 2020 presidential race, according to a Massachusetts senator.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that she would be closely monitoring her presidential bid in the midterm elections.
During a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren announced his plans to run.
According to Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and it's important that a woman is in charge".
I will strictly control my candidacy for the presidency after November 6 .
During the city council, Warren criticized President Donald Trump for "leading his country in the wrong direction".
"I am really very concerned about Donald Trump's actions against our democracy", he said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need to get the FBI to investigate before we vote".
The poll was released on Thursday, however, it was revealed that a majority of Warren's own constituents were against his running in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters said they "didn't care" if a senator was running.
And 32 percent wanted him to run.
The poll showed that the candidate of former governor Deval Patrick had the most support, with 38 percent of voters voting against him, while 48 percent voted against him.
As for the list of other high-profile Democrats running for office in 2020, it's important to mention Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden's official decision will be announced in January.
Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder that occurred during the political race of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested on Monday for domestic violence.
"I can tell you about the other people who are suffering from the effects of PTSD and other injuries from the war", he said at a rally in front of Donald in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin compares her detention to the elephant in the room and asks if her son and other veterans are a little changed and excited and if they have any respect for their fellow soldiers and pilots, for what any other country's military has given to their country.
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, the District of Columbia, support the debate over the new housing policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a lawsuit against a new U.S. law that prohibits sheltering victims of gang or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that on Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and counties supported a political asylum seeker who filed a lawsuit against the assistant attorney general.
The full name of the appellant in the Grace  Sessions complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal law in August was not disclosed.
She said that her partner and the sons of the gang had abused her, but on July 20, the authorities refused to give her shelter.
He was caught in Texas.
State prosecutors who supported Grace described countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which received the most asylum requests to the United States, as countries with widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
New US policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that would have allowed immigrants who had experienced domestic violence to apply for asylum without papers.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia said in a statement that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
 The federal law requires that all applications for housing be considered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the complaint, and such a ban violates this principle  says the assistant judge.
Prosecutors say that policies that restrict immigrants from entering the United States have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, as they are often entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labor force.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has banned immigration courts from providing shelter to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who have left their country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The publication is not dedicated to solving all the problems that happen every day around the world, including the most difficult ones.
Rescue efforts in Palu remain in a difficult situation, with the number of dead found during the search for survivors doubling the number of victims.
For those who survive, things get harder.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is looking after her child with a fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palo, said: "The situation is very difficult".
Ambulance is bringing people in every minute.
There is no clean water.
People are returning to their ruined houses, digging up their mud-covered belongings, trying to save whatever they can.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude quake, and hospitals were filled.
One of the injured, with a broken hip and shoulder, was placed near the Dwi Harris Palo military hospital, where patients were treated under the open sky due to the extreme post-shock condition.
And he remembered that the earthquake had shaken the fifth floor of the house, where he dwelt with his wife and his daughter; and his eyes were troubled.
We were unable to defend ourselves.
I felt like I was in a broken wall, Harris told The Associated Press, and also said that his girlfriend was at a party in town at the time.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe, I hope they are safe.
US ambassador accuses China of " propaganda "
After the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper about mutually beneficial trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
After US President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, China Daily pulled out a paid subscription to the best-selling Des Moines Register newspaper in Iowa, but China denied it.
Trump's accusations of Beijing interfering in the US election are a new phase in Trump's push to pressure China, according to American officials.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to improve trade, Beijing and Washington are currently intensifying their trade war and as a result are imposing the same tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say the Chinese response targets exporters in states like Iowa, which is heavily favored by Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, who was the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, believes Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, Branstad said that China is now "making things worse by putting propaganda in our own free press".
By distributing the leaflet, the Chinese government is exploiting the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by giving paid advertising to the Des Moines Register newspaper, writes Branstad.
"But you see a limited amount of opposition in Beijing and you don't see a real picture of the diverse opinions about China's difficult economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He also said that one of the most popular Chinese newspapers refused to publish it, but did not say which newspaper.
Experts warn that women voters were alienated before the interim period due to Kavanaugh
With Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh being supported and defended by many senior Republicans, experts warn that the upcoming midterm elections will see a particularly negative reaction from women.
This caused too much emotion and the majority of Republicans were able to declare that they wanted to dominate the vote.
"We can't go back to that", says Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.
Richer said he was not sure whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute attempt to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
As the Washington D.C. newspaper reported, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday, today, tomorrow, or in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn.
Mic reported that after Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite statements by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a protest group in the Senate corridor on Friday morning chanted "Crazy is coming".
Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, said on a news website: "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going out of the question".
People say it's too high, and it's true.
But it's probably higher, especially among women and those aged 18 to 29 who live in the suburbs and don't vote, even though they don't like the president".
Until Ford's full public statement about the allegations of sexual assault against the candidate in the Supreme Court, experts predicted that if he confirmed further, the response would be a reaction.
NBC News reported that former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week that "this is a no-win situation for the Republican Party".
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it's also about how Republicans decide and how they view it", said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helps Democrats win elections.
But Americans seem to be divided as to which of Ford's words or Kavanaugh's words they believe.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents think Ford's statement is either true or likely to be true, and 35 percent think Kavanaugh's statement is either true or likely to be true.
And 38 percent think Kavanagh lied in the interview, and 30 percent think Ford did.
According to The Guardian, after Flake's statement, the FBI is considering at least one other prosecutor's statement from Deborah Ramirez, in addition to Ford's indictment.
Last week, before a Senate committee on oaths, Kavanaugh testified that he had run into her when he was 17 and drunk.
Ramirez said that at a party when he was a student at Yale in the 1980s, a Supreme Court nominee showed him his penis.
Internet inventor plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, is about to launch a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend Inrupt is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can see what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "global domination".
"We need to do this now", he said about the startup.
 This is  a historic moment
The application uses Solid technology, which helps people create their own private online data storage (or POD).
It can include a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music collection, and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all coming together in one browser at the same time.
The characteristic of a personal data storage location is that it depends on the user who can use some information.
The company calls this "data-driven empowerment".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to make Solid accessible to everyone, by providing all the resources, processes and exercises of the company.
The company currently consists of a security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, several full-time developers and a community of volunteer programmers contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using the tools on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team did not talk to Facebook or Google about whether or not to implement a full upgrade that could completely update all business models in an hour.
We don't ask them for their permission.
In an article published on Medium on Sunday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is To provide commercial power and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-Based Network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over the neutrality of the network.
Inrupt was founded in 2008 by Berners-Lee, who remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very hopeful about the next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: a priest who fought in World War I was awarded the Victoria Cross
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was awarded in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Bernard Vann captured Bellengill and Løkur during the attack on 29 September 1918.
But he didn't know that he had been killed by a sniper four days later, and had received Britain's highest military award.
The monument was dedicated by his two grandsons at the Rusden Parade in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of his father's stone 100 years after he was awarded the prize was "full of spectacular symbolism".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Cole Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Cantin Canal in a thick fog and under heavy gun and gunfire.
Then he ran to the battle line and led it forward with great courage, before he ran with one hand to the spear and destroyed three detachments.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says that he never knows if he will be able to fill his father's role.
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, she and her brother Dr. James Vann placed a bouquet of flowers.
Michael Vann said that he was very proud to have participated in the "Share" and that "the courage of a true hero is expressed by the support shown by many people".
MMA fans were surprised to see Peppa Tower instead of Bellato
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, which was offered as a package, but instead featured Peppa Pig.
The San Jose event consisted of 13 fights, six of which were part of the main package and were broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6am, as Geagard Musase and Rory MacDonald prepare for the meeting, the UK audience switches to the broadcast of Peppa Pig.
And it was evil in the sight of the people that they slept not until the morning, because of the noise of the night.
A fan tweeted that the change to a children's cartoon is "somewhat funny".
When asked about the program, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, replied that they had to switch to a children's program at 6 p.m. because the content did not meet the government's resolution.
And Peppa is the matching pair.
The president of Bellator says they are thinking about reaching the UK audience in the future.
"I think we can sort it out when we think about playing again", said Coker.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't deal with it until Sunday, their time, on Monday.
But we're working on it.
When I changed it, there were different kinds of protests.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We were limited to five fights, not six, as usual, and we tried to get the fans, and we did it.
This attempt failed.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly feels inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete didn't realize that everyone was different from him until he went to high school.
Lauren LaVerne, host of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, said she spoke out about gay rights to give others hope.
She also said that she was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running show had taken a leave of absence due to illness.
As a guest star on LaVerne's first show, Daly said she felt "more inferior" than the other girls, "because it was not accepted in society as a relationship between boys and girls".
She said that until now, feeling really inferior and different was the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove himself, he didn't want to disappoint others when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a prominent LGBT activist, calling for homosexuality not to be criminalized at the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said that he said this to show that he had a way to live because he was able to live openly without persecution and to give hope to others.
She was inspired by falling in love with the three-time world champion, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but she says the age difference never caused any problems.
"It's hard to find a partner who has had such a maximum and minimum of moments after having gone through so much in his youth", he says. He went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June, and named their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that his perspective on life has changed.
"If you asked me one thing last year, I would tell you about the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold.
For me, the Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
Her son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly's father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was a ticket to the London 2012 Olympics, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
And he said, How could I say to him, Thou shalt not sit with my father in the bed?
"I held his hand until the last breath, and only when he expired, I knew that he was an invincible victor".
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"Diving in my own yard during the Olympics was the moment I realized that I had dreamed of all my life, I had never felt like this before", he said.
And that's what inspired her to choose her first song, "Proud by Heather Small", which was a song that hit her heart as she prepared for the Olympics, and it still resonates with her every time she listens to it.
The Discs of the Desert Island will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 AM EST.
No uniforms , Mikelson on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will play his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, setting a record, but he needs to change his form to avoid a disastrous result.
Mickelson, who was playing in the tournament for the 12th time in two years and set a record, replaced captain Jim Furyk with four balls and four fours on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the story, as in the United States, the five-time major winner spent this important day as a fan and working on his game on the pitch in an attempt to correct the holes that bothered him.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete, who had never competed directly, was not very flexible even on the hard track of the Le Golf National, which was completely destroyed by the long and harsh applause.
And if their pace isn't too daunting, Mickelson will join newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in his ninth match on Sunday to face British Open winner Francesco Molinari to win their four matches of the week.
If the Americans, who lost by four points in 12 singles matches, start the game with a high intensity, then Mikelson's match could become the deciding game.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, and he said nothing else.
"He understood his role today, and he hugged me and said he would be ready for tomorrow", said Furyk.
He is too confident.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's made a significant contribution to the game for these teams, both before and this week.
Maybe I didn't expect him to play the full two matches.
I thought a lot, but that's the way it's designed, so we thought we should keep it that way.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.
Mickelson surrendered Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched the level of his personal records.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation has brought significant changes to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to make fun of people, he's a perfect guy for our team", she said.
"I think it was fun for the young players this week to play with him, and we watched him.
He has more than enough to give".
According to European captain Thomas Bjorn , the dominance among the participants may soon be eliminated
The European captain Thomas Bjorn himself knows that it is quite possible that the important leadership in the individual Ryder Cup squads could turn into a bad trip.
The Danish started his career in the match in Valderram in 1997, and this time, the side led by Sev Ballesteros, with a five-point lead over the Americans, crossed the finish line with a steep head and won by 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You're not afraid to say we had a great opportunity in Valderram, but we had a great opportunity in Brooklyn, but we lost and we won fairly in Valderram", Bjorn said when the 2018 class won 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 on Le Golf National yesterday.
This is not the end of it, but time will tell.
You will leave tomorrow.
So do everything right.
It means that the game is not over until your score is written on the board.
Our goal is to try and capture that booty, and that goal will be the focus.
I used to say that I was focused on my 12 players, but we all know that the opposing team are the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who was pleased with the hard work of his players on the field, said: "I would never have controlled myself.
Tomorrow's game is in the morning.
Tomorrow, the players will go out individually and it will be different.
When the game is going well, you are lucky to have a partner who shares your joy, but when you are alone, you try to lose everything.
And I command you to give this word to the players, saying, Let them not be dismayed till the match be done to-morrow.
You're leaving your partner behind, and he's trying to take advantage of the opportunity".
Compared to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk in number will be looking for players who have performed better in individual games than in partner games, not counting Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who have scored three of the four points given.
Furyk stood alone at both ends of the big laps of this last day and played as part of the winning team in Brooklyn until his defeat during the "Miracle at Medina" game hosted by Europe.
"I still remember every damn word that was said about it", he said when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had brought the players together on the last day of 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start it fast like we saw in Brooklyn, Medina.
The momentum shifting to one side would put a lot of pressure on the interim matches.
With that in mind, we've changed the lineup and we're going to do something amazing tomorrow".
It's Thomas's job to try to control this fight, and he's going to go up against Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went out with these guys in this order, because I think they can completely circumvent the path in this order", Bjorn said during the individual selection.
Germany ' s new warship is postponed again
The latest frigate of the German fleet was commissioned in 2014 to replace the near-decayed warships used during the Quarter-Cabal War, however, according to local media, they will not be delivered until at least next year due to faulty systems and delivery costs.
The commissioning of the main ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg line, the Rhineland-Palatinate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be delivered to the fleet in 2014, however, the dangerous problems that arose after the ship was delivered influenced the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg line, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen line.
It is known that they will have powerful missiles, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as invisible technologies such as miniaturized radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include the duration of service, i.e. the possibility of supplying the last type of frigates dispatched from the inland ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were supposed to allow Germany to project electricity abroad, will become obsolete without being commissioned, Die Zeit noted.
The incident made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the F125 frigate, which had suffered a breakdown, and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
The Navy has never before returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivering the ship.
There is no definitive information on the reasons for the ship's return, although the German media reported a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that rendered the ship unfit for combat duty.
The software deficiencies are particularly significant because the ships on the Baden-Württemberg line are equipped with a crew of about 120 sailors, which is only half the crew of the older frigates on the Bremen line.
In addition, the ship was found to be overweight, meaning that the excess weight would reduce the ship's performance and limit the Navy's ability to make further improvements in the future.
The 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is considered twice as heavy as the ships of this type used by the Germans during World War II.
The total cost of this project, excluding the equipment failure, including the cost of training the team, is also a controversial issue.
He said that it has reached an astonishing level, i.e. from the initial 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
The issue of acquiring new frigates is of great importance today, after the warnings of the German Navy about the cuts.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliamentary Committee on Defence, Hans-Peter Bartels, said that "the number of ships in the navy is almost exhausted".
The issue was further aggravated by the fact that the old ships were being scrapped and no replacement ships were being delivered, said Sheneunik.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg line had yet been handed over to the fleet.
National Trust secretly listens to the secret life of the billboards
New research on land in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at showing how the larvae use the landscape to find food.
We hope that this information will help us to look at the behavior of isolated flying mammals from a new perspective and protect them in the future.
Research by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will further explore the common and soprano pipistrello, as well as the brown long-haired spiderling and Daubenton spiderling in Inverewe Park in West Ross.
Special registers will be installed on the important objects of the hotel area to monitor the actions of the billboards throughout the period .
In addition, NHS staff and volunteers will conduct mobile screening with the help of handheld detectors.
The sound analysis of all the recordings determines the frequency of the calls and what kind of ads they do.
Then a map and a calculation of the habitat are made to give a complete picture of their activity in the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, said he hopes the study will reveal which habitats are suitable for the larvae and which species use them.
This information will help to determine the effectiveness of work such as greening, maintenance of forest mats for wild boar and similar animals to monitor the habitat.
The population of the scallop in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the last hundred years.
The construction and development work is hindering their livelihood and threatening to destroy their habitat.
They are also at risk from wind turbines and lighting, chemical processing of adhesives and building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
The fact is, the comics are not blind.
However, when it comes to finding food, they need their hearing rather than their eyes to hunt in the dark.
During flight, they use sophisticated echo-location techniques to accurately identify hazards and obstacles in their path.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important parks and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, is very responsible in the issue of landmarks.
There are ten experts who are trained and they regularly conduct surveys, check the area and sometimes even rescue.
The organisation even opened the first ever Scottish herring fund at Treve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten Scottish herrings live.
According to real estate manager David Thompson, this land is a perfect habitat for wild boar.
"There are some wonderful places for the pigeons here in Treviso", he said.
"We have old buildings, we have a lot of veterans and a very comfortable environment.
But there's still a lot of unknown data about the signs, so the work that's being done in these areas and in other areas will help us better understand what we need to replicate them".
He noted the importance of checking the presence of signs in the given area before starting the renovation of buildings, as the accidental destruction of one nest can cause damage to about 400 male signs and cubs of the local population.
The decrees are protected and it is against the law to kill them, touch them or break their nest.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer and spokesperson for the Trust for the Protection of Ancient Monuments, appealed to the public for help.
He said, "We don't know much about our own species, and we don't know anything about the populations of some of them".
Ronaldo refused the rape claim because his lawyers were going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed that the rape allegations against him are "fake news", and that people are using his name to "give their name away".
His lawyers are considering suing the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In an effort to keep the incident under wraps, he paid her $375,000, Der Spiegel said in a statement on Friday.
A few hours after receiving the protest message, Ronaldo, 33, said in a video on Instagram that the message was "fake news" to his 142 million followers.
And I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what is that is the way that is the way to do that is to do that.
What they said today is false", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said.
"They want to be called by my name.
This is normal.
They want to make a name for themselves by using my name, that's their job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they describe as "unforgivable reporting on suspicious secrets".
According to the lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will demand compensation "in proportion to the amount of moral damage caused by this, which has become one of the most serious forms of violation of personal rights in recent years".
According to the report, the incident took place in June 2009 in a hotel room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada show that after a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room and where he allegedly raped her.
According to Majorga, Ronaldo knelt down after the telling incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and only "down to one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo said that the couple had consensual sex.
According to the mayor, he reported to the police and photographed the injuries he suffered in the hospital, but later decided to settle the matter out of court, because he feared "disgrace" and "public embarrassment".
34 We believe the young woman, she is still suffering from the news, and therefore refuses to stay.
The incident is believed to have occurred as Ronaldo was transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he signed a €100 million contract with Italian giants Juventus.
Brexit: UK will regret for life the loss of car manufacturers
Business Minister Greg Clarke said that if Britain lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, it would "regret it for the rest of its life".
It is a "serious matter" that Toyota UK has informed the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily shut down its Bernaston plant near Derby, he added.
"We need to sign a contract", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that delays at the border due to the inaction of Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, and 90% of them were exported to other parts of the EU.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see a production halt at our factory", said Marvin Cook, executive director of Toyota in the Burnaston area.
Other UK carmakers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed their concern about leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade activities.
For example, BMW announced that it would close its mini factory in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main threat, according to carmakers, is the supply chain risk, which is not related to Brexit.
Toyota's production line is carried out "on time" and the parts of the cars made to order are delivered every 37 minutes with the help of UK and EU suppliers.
According to experts, if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be problems with delays at the border and a shortage of parts.
Toyota says it can't keep its stock in the Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and that's why production is halted.
According to Mr. Clark, Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "very well designed to prevent border checks like this".
"We need to get a contract. I think we need a good contract right now that not only allows us to succeed, but also allows us to take advantage of that opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers are certified  to continue the trend that has been a very successful set of supply chains so far".
Toyota did not say how long the production would stop, but warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness in the future and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsvalaris, who worked at Bernaston for 24 years and was a member of the Unite union at the factory, expressed the concern of all union members: "My experience is that these jobs are not reopened once they are closed.
The Government spokesperson said: "We have presented a concrete and solid plan for our future relations with the EU".
According to the White House , the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be delayed for another week" as Brett Kavanaugh's fight for the Supreme Court seat continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who deals with issues such as Russian interference in elections, the relationship between Trump and Russian aides, and the President's possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump would dismiss the deputy attorney general and whether Muller's independence would be threatened as a result has been the subject of much debate in Washington over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had suggested using a recording network to record their speeches during a meeting with Trump and talked about the possibility of removing the president with the help of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to confirm this.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House and announced his resignation.
As a result, Trump's meeting with Trump was postponed to Thursday due to his visit to the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't want to dismiss" Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed again to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would have to deal with Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who testified.
On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the Kavanaugh case, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "The date is not known yet, maybe this week, and I would like to suggest that it may be postponed for another week, given other events that are happening in the Supreme Court.
We'll see about it again, but I want the press to know about it".
Some journalists disagreed with this statement: Sanders had not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The driver, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the rarity of press conferences was not a "vision" for the TV community, but he did say, "I have no objection to their having a board".
He then advised that Trump and the press should establish direct contact.
"The president has held comparatively more Q&A sessions than he has in the past", he said, without providing any specific evidence: "We have looked at these data".
Sanders said that the press conferences would continue as before, but that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much more important than talking to me.
"We're trying to do this more often, and you've seen how we've been working over the last few weeks, and your conversation with the president of the United States can replace a press briefing".
Trump will regularly answer all questions asked on his way out of the White House or during open sessions and press conferences for senior officials.
Special press conferences are rarely organized.
This week in New York, the president was able to explain to a gathering of reporters why he was so neutral and sometimes so different.
Health Minister warns EU workers in Scotland about Brexit
The Minister of Health thanked EU workers in Scotland on behalf of the country and wished them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, sent this letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has taken on the costs of the applications for settlement by EU citizens in the public service.
Ms Freeman said in her letter: "The negotiations on the separation between the UK and the EU have been going on all summer and by the autumn, the final decision was almost made.
However, the Government of the UK is also preparing for a non-contract scenario.
I understand that this is a difficult time for you.
So I want to reiterate how much I value the work of every worker and I don't discriminate by race.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring us valuable experiences and skills that improve and develop healthcare services, while benefiting patients and the organizations we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay".
Christy Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery due to head injury
Tennessee's Mike Organ said Tennessee Giants quarterback Christie Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery for a head injury he sustained in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident occurred shortly before the break.
"He went out and recognized him there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie extra oxygen at the end of the pitch before he was put in a crate and taken for examination.
Chris Harris, a Nashville, Tennessee, WSMV official, said Abercrombie had recovered from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"We have no information about the extent or degree of the injuries", Harris added, while the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
It was Abercrombie's first season as a redshirt sophomore after moving from Illinois to Tennessee.
By the time he left the game on Saturday, he had completed five catches, which would have brought his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will pay more stamp duty when purchasing real estate on the territory of the DK
Foreign buyers will pay more stamp duty when purchasing real estate on the territory of the KC and according to the Tory plan , the proceeds will be used to help homeless people
This move neutralizes Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on individuals and organisations who do not pay taxes on the territory of the United Kingdom.
In order to help the disadvantaged , it is planned that as a result of this decision , up to 120 million pounds sterling per year will be transferred to the treasury .
Theresa May announced that foreign buyers will pay more stamp duty if they buy real estate in the territory of the Kingdom of Uzbekistan and the proceeds will be used to help homeless people.
This is an attempt by Jeremy Corbyn to neutralize his attempts to attract young voters by speaking out on the issue of affordable housing and higher wages.
The increased flag fee will be collected from non-taxable individuals and organisations across the UK, and the proceeds will be used to help the Government fight insomnia.
The amount of the premium to the current flag tax is not less than three percent of the high level tax and customs duties two years ago.
The decision is expected to bring the treasury up to 120 million pounds a year.
The data shows that 13% of London's real estate is owned by non-British sellers, and this is affecting the price of the property, which reduces the chances of new sellers climbing the housing ladder.
Many potential areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "neighboring cities" due to the increase in foreign settlers who spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy was born just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the flag tax to help many young people buy their first housing.
He accused large construction firms of taking over land but not using it to prevent the property from falling in price and urged Mrs May to abandon the affordable housing quota to end the "housing construction scandal" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin said that he has proposed several attractive housing reforms, such as controlling the cost of renting housing and unjustified eviction.
He also said that he would like to give more authority to the delegation for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiership to the British dream, to improving the lives of the next generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The doors of Britain are always open to anyone who wants to live, work and live here.
But I think it's not fair that people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies have easier access to housing than hardworking British people.
For many people, housing is an impossible dream, and the stigma of sleeplessness is too real".
Jack Ross said , " My main goal is to govern Scotland . "
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "main goal" was to be appointed Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman will enjoy reviving the North-East club, who are third in the Premier League by three points.
After sending Saint-Miren to the Premier League last season, he moved to the Light Stadium this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I took the B cap, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching the Scottish game in Hampden with my father since I was very young and that was the reason I came back.
If I manage the club, I will have the opportunity".
Prior to Ross, Sunderland had been managed by the likes of Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyetta and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Barnsley and Ipswich Town, who had previously refused to accept an overture, was not alarmed that he would be following the footsteps of such a prestigious figure at such a large club.
"Can I get the club back into the Premier League?" is the question that will determine whether I succeed right now.
He said that the club is in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities.
"It's not easy to get in, but if I can give him back the club, I think I can see that I can be successful here".
Ross began his managerial career just three years ago, after working as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and then as one of the Hart's coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa back into the third tier, and helped the relegated St Mirren win the championship in the next round.
Ross said he felt more comfortable than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
She said that she felt that she was really on the right track when it came to taking responsibility for God.
"I really thought that I would be better suited to directing than to playing.
And that sounds funny, because I did my job well, I was getting paid well, and I was getting pretty good results.
But playing can be difficult.
We have to do some work in a week.
I'm going through some of the hardest parts of the job, but the management part is still going strong.
I've always wanted to lead, and I'm finding the most comfortable place for myself as an adult".
The full interview for Sportsound can be heard on Scottish Radio on 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 (UK time).
Studies show that the best time to drink a pint is on Saturday at 5:30.
The dispute was beneficial to competing British pubs, but had a negative impact on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent in July, but orders in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business adviser who published the indicators, said: "The heat and England's delayed World Cup appearance means that the season will repeat in July, when pubs' profits were at 2.8 per cent, and the losses to restaurants will be even greater.
The situation of restaurants with a decline in revenue of 1.8% in the season will be worse.
Pubs and bars are more popular than restaurants.
Pubs that serve food are also more prone to damage in hot weather, but not in the same harsh conditions as restaurants.
People just go out to drink.
Pubs and bars have seen a 6.6% increase in their drinks sales in one month, while food sales have dropped by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM Entertainment and Hospitality Analyst, said: "These results continue the trend from April.
When it comes to outdoor sales, weather and the impact of social or sporting events remain the biggest factors.
Restaurant groups will certainly continue to struggle, but the annual decline in sales of 4.8 percent, especially due to price pressure, will be a severe blow.
The long hot summer has turned into the worst time for the food industry, and whether the average temperature in August can be a little bit of a boost or not, time will tell".
Including new establishments, overall sales in pubs and restaurants increased by 2.7 percent in July, which is slowing the emergence of brands.
For the British pub, bar and restaurant sector, Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales tracking service, collects and analyses data on the production of 47 operating groups with a total turnover of £9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a social network account that they hide from their parents
Studies show that one in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have a secret government network account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a surge in "fake" Insta pages
There is a strong suspicion that sexual content is being made
Twenty percent of students have a basic accounting that shows their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 teenagers) create a social network account that they keep secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rise in "fake Insta" pages linked to photo sharing site Instagram.
There is a strong suspicion that sexual content is being made.
Twenty percent of the students have a basic account that they show their parents, and they keep a secret account.
A mother who discovered the secret behavior of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager begging to rape others.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Principals Conference found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, one of which they keep secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that teenagers are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find".
Eileen Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council
At the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body, Eilid Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council.
Doyle  The most decorated athlete and chairman, Jan Bitti, described this step as a great opportunity for the sport management to use his rich experience at international level over the last decade.
"Ayleed is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the world community and we think Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from her appointment to the board", said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm trying to be the voice of the sports people and I hope to help develop and guide the sport in Scotland".
The winner of the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, who is now a regular BBC scientist, was left unable to walk after an ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would fake it or how much I would fake it.
It was a lot of hard work, but I completely recovered, I started walking again, and today I am practicing my skills!
Thank you for your supporting posts!"
Women compared to cows in promotional video of the Kode pump
The company that makes the breast pump has created a lot of controversy online when it compares nursing mothers to cows that give milk.
Consumer technology company Elvie released a bizarre ad to showcase the freedom given to mothers to announce the launch of what they call the world's first wearable silent breast pack.
In a grass-filled barn, four females dance the lyrics: "Yes, I'm sucking, but I don't have a tail", and "If you don't notice that it's not the wind, then it's my belly".
And I will feed the children, and feed the women; I will suckle and suckle, and feed the children.
However, the company's Facebook ad caused controversy online.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, has received mixed reviews from viewers, many of whom said it exposes the dairy industry's shame.
"It was a very bad decision to use a cow to promote this product.
They will also become pregnant like us, they will give birth and wean. But after a few days they will take their children away.
Elvie chest pump is not detectable inside the chest cavity (Elvie/Ana)
Another opinion is: "It is understandable that it is harmful to both mother and child.
But why not use it to announce the breast pump to mothers who want to hold their baby?"
Another commented, "It's not relevant advertising".
While others were supporting the ad, one woman found the song amusing.
I think that's a great idea.
If I was nursing, I'd get one of these.
As a result of using the suction, I felt like a cow.
The ad was a little bit silly, but I took it as it was.
This is a bad product.
Another commented: This funny ad is for mothers who use a breast pump (mostly at work or in the toilet) and who feel like a pig.
This is not a promotion to elevate or lower the status of dairy farming.
Towards the end of the scene, a group of women are shown dancing with a pair of suckers threaded under their breasts.
The concept of this ad is based on the idea that many women who use the breast milk feel like cows.
However, the Elvi suckler makes no sound at all, it has no wires or tubes, and it penetrates the breast without any concern, allowing women to move freely, hold the baby, and even go out into the field during lactation.
According to our colleague and expert on early childhood development, Ana Balarin, who is breastfeeding: Elvi milk is such a revolutionary product that its launch on the market deserves to be bold and thoughtful.
By showing women and dairy cows and showing the parallels between them, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using and using dairy cows, while showing the amazing sense of freedom that the new dairy provides, which is both refreshing and comparative.
It's not the first time that Elvie's suckling has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children stood on the podium at a fashion show by designer Martha Yakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved peacefully from tent camps on the Texas border.
While the number of border crossings has not changed significantly, the number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, because at times, the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with the help of sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants, and they don't want to be seen as a threat by demanding a child and losing their chance to stay in the country.
The threat is eliminated in June when representatives of the federal administration announced that it is mandatory to submit fingerprints of potential sponsors and other minor citizens living in their homes and that this information will be sent to the migration office.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of minors who had lost custody.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
 About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with ties to crime.
We will continue to pursue these people", Mr. Albenz said.
To speed up the work with children, the authorities introduced new rules, which, according to the camp workers, require that some people appear in court within a month after their arrest, instead of 60 days after the previously established one.
Instead of face-to-face meetings, people will be able to communicate their requests for legalization to the immigration judge via videoconference.
Anyone who is deemed unfit for assistance is quickly deported.
Based on the camp staff and the reports made in the system in recent months, the longer children are in defense, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to further violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that in large institutions like Tornillo, these problems are increasing because children can be left in a place where they are not taken care of.
They said that moving children to a tent city without emotional preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the psychological damage that most people cannot overcome.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homelands despite the war that has been raging in the country for eight years.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Muallem, the illegal presence of foreign troops in Syria under the pretext of the war on terrorism will be properly addressed.
"They should leave the country immediately, no matter what".
Muallem said that the war against terrorism in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011, is over.
He said that Damascus will not stop this holy battle until it clears the whole territory of Syria from any illegal foreign invasion, including terrorist groups.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and training mostly Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are over 1,000 French troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the situation is favorable for their return, and that the reason why refugees are leaving the country is because other Western countries are spreading irrational fear.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to the return of refugees", he said.
 They have turned a purely social issue into a political one.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided to rebuild Syria unless there is an agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held area of Idlib has allowed for the continuation of political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a region of three million people.
Muallem also stressed that the agreement has a "definite timeline" and hopes that military action will be directed at the jihadists, including the Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaeda.
UN spokesman Stefan de Mistura hoped to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of representatives of the government and opposition, which will be dedicated to drafting a post-war Syrian constitution and paving the way for elections.
The interim minister made arrangements for the Syrian government to participate in the committee's work, warning it not to proceed, stating that the working group should be limited to revising the existing constitution.
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Mr. Trump could have been re-elected in 2020 if he had not been impeached and dismissed before the end of his presidential term, as many liberal observers had hoped.
This would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!
At the moment, the audience shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC have tripled to 1.6 million.
Nielsen said that Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the ratings of cable networks with 3.5 million viewers watching the evening news headlines.
"This is a fire that people are chasing blindly, and we don't understand it", says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama "The Embedded Savior", about the cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in the attack.

"What?" he asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Skwell said.
There is something fun about chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, a news network in Washington would have defined the future of Roe v. Wade, would immigrant families be reunited and would it affect the state of the global economy?
Only those who have special privileges can delete it.
For six hours, I've been discussing the foundation of Bob Woodward's Fear, watching Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, and also learning about the brutal description of Sturmy Daniels' Trump anatomy, which is beyond the scope of a citizen with knowledge of the information.
I can't, under any circumstances, look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"The fact that what he's doing is a reality show, in some cases, is because he's showing you something pretty much every night", said Brent Montgomery, head of the Willow Entertainment Center and author of "The Untiring Stars", about the people in the Trump program and the daily plot changes (such as choosing a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I called Mr. Fleiss this week, he had 80 degrees outside on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was sitting in the hole watching MSNBC and copying CNN.
Although Brett Kavanaugh was accountable to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he could not intervene even though the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing these demonic programs years ago, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true.

The money flows from outside the White House are poured into the tough election campaigns that take place at the busiest times.
With the redistricting of congressional districts, it's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is receiving financial aid, with two candidates running for each seat.
The newly rebuilt suburbs of Pittsburgh will undoubtedly be a drag on Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special district last spring.
Lamb is running for office against Republican Kate Rothfuss, who is currently the representative for the old 12th District, which overlaps with Pennsylvania's new 17th District.
The maps were rebuilt after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old territories had been unconstitutionally annexed by the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District, the main Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DNC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (RNC) party funding groups, caused funding to decline.
After a minor victory in the widely-observed March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won it by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
US sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China later eased
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing with little opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera and occupied a hotel in Panama until his colleagues fired the Trump Organization management team.
In accordance with the ruling that Taiwan should no longer be recognized as a country, State Department officials have decided to return American diplomatic officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the fines were only applied to El Salvador in 2017, which received $140 million in aid from the US to curb drug use, develop the country and support the economy.
The proposed fines, cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, and high unemployment and homicide rates will certainly have a severe impact on the Central American country.
In the course of the internal meetings, the leaders of North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from returning to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior officials had expressed their full support for the conference to be held sooner, and as a result, they wanted the sanctions on El Salvador to be lifted.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence intends to discuss the transfer of seats in the administration meeting at a meeting scheduled for mid-October.
The three American ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh warnings or sanctions from Washington.
White House Speaker Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussions described by three American officials, including two diplomats, and they settled on an anonymous discussion.
Their report was confirmed by an outside expert close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Searching the history
The next step could be a report prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller about Trump's obstruction of justice, which is now publicly available with substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly turned his research to the question of whether there was a collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence our election.
If Congress is going to go from one place to another, Mr. Trump is going to be accountable to that organization, because he's going to be prepared to go back to the electorate, and eventually, to the House of Lords.
There are a lot of "ifs" here, but I'm not saying that Trump or Europeans like him will definitely lose.
The choices we make on both sides of the Atlantic will determine how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, when Western countries were opposed to Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler.
We have missed the opportunity to relieve and prevent years of bloodshed.
History develops around these turning points and the unwavering march of democracy is revived or perpetuated.
Americans are currently experiencing some of these turning points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who was in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the same newspaper last year suggested secretly videotaping the president and announcing that he was unfit for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the information provided by The Times was not true.
If the newly appointed FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if the Supreme Court upholds it despite evidence of sexual assault and perjury, what are we going to do?
And first of all, in the midterm elections, will we vote for Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will be dormant for a long time.
But, as a result of the lesson of what happened in Prague, I hope we don't give up.
My mother, a Czechoslovak Jew, was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied my embassy.
He survived, he moved to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to that table with a swastika in his hand to light the candles on the Sabbath.

Rangers Graham Dorrance is optimistic about the conflict in Vienna.
The Rangers hosted "Champions Vienna" on Thursday, and after a great game against "Villarreal" earlier this month, beating the Austrians will cement their place in Group D of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorran was unable to play for the first time this season before the score was 2-2 with Villarreal, but he said he hoped the Rangers would use this as a springboard to great success.
"It was a good experience for us, because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
"We went in the hope that we would not lose the game and we scored a point".
Although we broke the rules of the game in the end, I believe the result was fair.
They played better in the first half of the game, but in the second half of the game we seemed to have a better performance.
Thursday is a big night for Europe.
I hope we get three points, but it seems difficult for us, because they did well in the previous game, but with the support of the fans who trusted us, I am sure that we will try and do better.
Last year was definitely a difficult year for me, and it's largely due to my injury and the changes at the club, but I must not forget the factor that makes me feel good here.
The group is doing well, the boys are getting only positive feedback, and the training is also going well.
I hope that we will move on from the past season and achieve success.
Women lose sleep over fears about pension savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for artificially, few people were talking to their family members about it.
Nearly half of the respondents said they had spoken to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Industry, "People want to be cared for by their family members, but they're not taking steps to talk to each other about it".
We have to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare to care for your family without first expressing your wishes.
You need to talk to your counselor and your family about where and how you can get care, because these decisions are important factors in determining the price.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor may be able to find a way to make payments.
Your choice of long-term care financing is a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps you pay for expenses, or if you have money, self-insurance at your own expense.
Confirm legal documents: To avoid legal disputes, discuss everything at the place of the documentation.
Choose a health care official where you go, and in that case, someone you trust will evaluate your level of care and make sure that the professionals are doing what you want (if you can't talk).
Also, consider the need for an attorney for financial matters.
When you are incapacitated, you need to find someone you can trust to make financial decisions and pay your expenses.
Remember the details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents has an emergency and is now being taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Make a plan and write down the information, and make sure you are ready.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
This week, 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, and officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the loss of communication, the aid workers could not receive any information from the Donggala area in the north of the city of Palo, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palau.
Here are some basic facts about Palau and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palou is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, at the end of a narrow peninsula, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency in the northwest of Sulawesi Island stretching along a coastline of over 300 km (180 mi).
The population of the regency in the administrative district located in the lower part of the province in 2017 was 299 200 people .
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstay of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially along the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but the business is mainly concentrated in Moralowi, on the opposite bank of the Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, over the past 100 years, there have been several tsunamis in Palu and Donggala.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala claimed the lives of over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active area known as the "Ring of Fire of the Pacific", and is prone to earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26 off the west coast of Aceh province, north of the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, several powerful earthquakes occurred off the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits the most densely populated island of Java in southern Indonesia, sinking to the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the capital of West Sumatra, Padang.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the island of Metawai in Sumatra causes a 10-meter tsunami, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A low-altitude earthquake in the Pidi Jay Regency of Aceh, causing devastation and panic among the population, because people were warned of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were trapped in the collapsed buildings and died.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented thousands of tourists from returning to their homes.
Sara Palin ' s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Track Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troops, who resisted arrest by obstructing access to information about domestic violence.
According to the police, the woman's acquaintance took her phone when she tried to report the alleged crimes to the police.
Paylin was placed in Mat-Su's detention center, where $500 in unsecured bonds was held, KTUU reported.
When he appeared in court on Saturday and demanded a confession, it was reported that he declared himself "totally innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A felonies, which could result in up to a year in prison or a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B felony, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been sentenced.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans' Council.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, giving false information about domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend complained about his punishment and hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin has been criticized by veterans for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder, which was a result of his service in the Army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed.
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5 and caused a tsunami, killing thousands of cows.
The number of people who have died due to power and communication failures is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck in the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on social media that capture the moment of impact.
By the time the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palo.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are considering a rare death sentence for Saifolllo Saipov, suspected of the New York terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence not used in the federal crime state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov rented a truck in a warehouse to attack pedestrians and cyclists along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan.
To justify the use of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov, in connection with the Southern District of New York's death penalty document, "intentionally" assaulted eight victims and inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court documentation, the death penalty can be imposed on two items.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, which are typically used by federal prosecutors for organized crime, violent crimes, and vehicular homicide.
Prosecutors described Saipov's criminal behavior as "heinous, cruel and seductive", saying the terrorist act required "cautious and pre-planned" planning.
"Saipov has caused damage to the families and friends of the following citizens: Diego Enrique Andjelini, Nicolasa Kleveza, Ann-Lora Decadat, Darrena Dreyka, Ariella Erlia, Erna Ferruchi, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuckko", the state prosecutor said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last death penalty case was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was imposed on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, after the couple had been convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Crimean War.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the terrorist act.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt better after what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit a terrorist act after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who defended Saipov, said that the prosecutor's decision "has left the country disappointed".
"We believe that instead of a guilty plea and a prison sentence without possibility of release, the death penalty would prolong the suffering for everyone involved in this incident", Patton said.
The group of Saipov's defenders asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory government spokesman said Nigel Farage should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilize the Khazarian army during the protest at the Tory conference today.
The former leader of UKIP, said that politicians should feel the heat coming from eurosceptics, because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, thought she should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Conservative agent Peter Bonn said at a march in Birmingham that if Mr. Fracky had been the Brexit secretary, England would have left the EU by now.
But Mrs May's problem with reconciling her deeply divided views was highlighted by the Tory protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is doing everything he can to keep the peace plan, and the attackers are those who want Brexit, those who want to stay in the union, and those who want the EU.
The Allies, despite the negative reaction, are trying to negotiate with Brussels and demand that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.
He suggested that Faraj should be held responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would not be in this union".
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I am for Brexit, but we need to put pressure on the Cheekers.'
He said: "We are not in the world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since 2016: The idea that the British people would change their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely false.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also at the march, and she told reporters: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Cheekers are not attractive to the masses, the opposition does not vote for them, they are not popular, first of all, among our party and the activists who vote for us, after they have damaged our streets.
Put down the checks and start listening.'
In a letter to Mrs. May, he added: "Prime Ministers can only keep their positions if they stand by their words.
Mr. Faraj said that if the politicians who opposed the decision of the 2016 referendum wanted to betray, they would feel confident.
"Now it is about trust between the people and our political circle", he said.
They're trying to sell Brexit, and we're here to tell them, 'We're not going to let you do this and leave.'
In a message to a group of people, he added: "I want to feel the warmth of our political environment that is on the side of betraying Brexit".
We will rally the people of this country who have won us the Brexit and we will not stop until the UK is an independent, self-governing, proud nation.
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay in the union marched through Birmingham and held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After several activists launched the group this weekend, they took out banners with the Tories against Brexit.
Labour Party member Lord Adoni laughed at the Conservatives when he reminded them of the security concerns that had arisen at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who are building IT systems and saying that all technology is ready for Canada and that there is a possibility of free trade in Ireland without borders", he said.
It's a very funny joke.
He added: "There is nothing better than Brexit".
Warren plans to show balance in his presidential bid
After the US elections in November, Senator Elizabeth also said that she would consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat will speak about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Deal, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair.
He was at the center of speculation that he might succeed Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, Trump held his 36th meeting with voters in a city-wide format in Holyoke after taking office.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren says it's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government that's not working properly, and that it's time for a woman to be at the top of the leadership.
Suspect arrested after Louisiana State University player Sims was shot dead
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, say they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LMU basketball player Wade Sims on Saturday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Deaton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m., ET news release.
They posted video of the shooting online on Thursday and asked for help in identifying the person in the photo.
Sims, 20, was shot dead outside the campus of Southern University on Friday.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Sunday that Wade Sims was shot in the head and died.
When Wade stepped in to protect his friend, Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, using a weapon, and riding Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-3 junior at Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: After losing to Sebastian Fettl, Lewis Hamilton won the title of world champion.
From the moment Valteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes would play a big role in the race.
Bottas started to play well from pole position, and promptly dismissed Hamilton, defending his position in the first two corners, and encouraging Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettle got into the hole first, and left Hamilton to start the traffic at the end of the line, something crucial had to happen.
Mercedes later circled the circle, leaving Fettell behind, but Hamilton took the lead after the wheels were level, forcing the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, making a two-class move to defend in the third corner.
Max started from the back row with Westpen, coming seventh after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Then, for most of the race, Kimmy was ahead, holding onto his tyres, and trying to overtake Rykonen to finish in the top four.
On lap 44, he crashed into the holes and failed to improve his speed on the final eight laps, and Ryokan came fourth.
It's a tough day because Valteri has done a great job all weekend and passed me by as a true gentleman.
The team did a remarkable job of shooting two rabbits with one bullet".
It was really bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for not following up on Christine Blaisey Ford for not delivering a letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking to the West Virginia convention, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford, but in the midst of the Senate Judiciary Committee against him, he said that the situation in the Senate made people look like liars, hypocrites, distrustful.
"What you've seen in the Senate these last few days is that you see the faces of people, they're bad people, they're hypocrites, they're liars", he said.
And you see the holes and the holes, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do that".
"I didn't do this".
Do You Remember?
Diana Feinstein, have you made it public?
And remember his answer -- you've made the document public -- oh, wow, what?
Oh, no. I was just trying to help.
"I did not publish"
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we announce it?No, we didn't", he said, under the influence of the senator.
Feinstein was sent a detailed letter of accusations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, which was in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide, Dr. Ford's conclusions, I didn't publish his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
And he said unto me, Keep it secret; and I kept it secret.
But his rhetoric seemed to displease the president who commented at a meeting on Saturday night: "I would tell you that it was really bad body language.
He may not do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president continued to defend the nomination of a man accused of sexually assaulting three women to the Supreme Court, suggesting that the Democrats were using the indictment to their advantage.
"They are determined to restore power by any means necessary.
"You see the hypocrisy and hypocrisy, and it doesn't matter who they have to beat and crush to get power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 against Belfast
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against the Belfast giants from the Dundee Stars
The Dundee Stars won the 5-3 replay against Dundee on Friday, losing in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants.
The Alps took an early lead with two goals, thanks to the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney, Dwyer, rose to the top before restoring the Alps' lead.
Lundwald tied the score with François Bouchard against Dundee, two goals ahead of Nielsen.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Kiff's men, who had come after Belfast to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the sides this season, when the Alps won the previous three matches".
With the help of opening assistant Kendall MacFolder, David Rutherford, who had secured Dwyer, Boville doubled the lead after four minutes.
Sullivan brought the hosts back to 13:10 in the first period, before Matt Markward was the one who delivered Cooney's equalizer at 15:16.
When Duayer scored the second goal late in the first period, the Giants were able to take the lead at the first break.
And the men of the field were gathered together, and Bozhar brought them again, and counted them to thirty-seven.
Cooney joined Charles Corcoran for the first time in the second half to help Nelson give Dundee the lead in the match, and he ensured his team's fifth-half victory in the final period.
The Alps have now lost four of their last five matches and will play the next match on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Aerial dispatcher killed in rescue of hundreds of passengers in earthquake
An air traffic controller who helped hundreds of people in Indonesia get a plane off the ground safely and then killed himself is being hailed as a hero.
More than 800 people were killed and many more were left missing after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continues to be devastated by massive underground dams, many of which have been reduced to rubble in the city of Palo.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Guanawan Agung refused to leave his job in the heavily balanced control tower at Mutara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained on the runway to ensure that Baltic Air Flight 6321 could safely take off.
Then he jumped from the control tower thinking that it was falling down.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air navigation official Johannes Siret said the decision saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter to take her to a large hospital in the city, besides Baliqpapan in Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we lost him before the helicopter reached Paoli.
"This is a terrible thing to hear".
Authorities also fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster relief agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
The number of victims is still expected to increase, because many bodies are still under the rubble, most of them are inaccessible", said Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the Sotopo Agency.
Waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) swept through the city of Palo, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and food supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances are bringing bodies in.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere".
Jan Gelphand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is helping the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could have been worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palulu on Sunday and told the country's military, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, the Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by a devastating earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports one person missing from the lagoon crash
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, reported that one person was missing without warning, and all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the flooded plane.
Air New Guinea said in a press release that it was not possible to account for the male passenger in this case on Saturday.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline announced that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition".
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remained unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crashed into the runway.
American passenger Bill Jones said that the plane was flying very low.
"That's a very good thing", said Jane.
Jaines said that she and others were able to swim to the water's edge and reach the emergency exit doors of the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots shouted and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors working on improving the nearby pier helped rescue the plane using a paddleboat before it sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Flight Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have been related to Air Niwigini.
Analyst drew up a nightly schedule of the woman who burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against a man who set a woman on fire in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the US Department of Justice, spent hours arguing as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers for one night of a murder.
Clarion Ledger claimed that Rowlett had obtained location data from several cell phones, which determined that she was with Tellis Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts Tellis' previous answers.
When the data showed that his cell phone records were with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and the police went to Sanford for questioning.
Sanford testified that he was not in town on Saturday.
Since the prosecutors claimed that Tells was in Sanford's truck, the prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth, and he said, "He's lying, my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that at the time of Chambers' death, Tellis said he had known him for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from her phone several days after Chambers' death.
And he said, He hath taken away his life.
The defense must begin the final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be submitted to the jury later that day.
Top seed: What is digital hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio is trying to change the negative perception of the genre by writing positive lyrics to their songs.
Bristol-based band The High Breed claim that "Hip-hop has moved away from political ideas and social issues".
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is he a black man?
A babysitter in New York sued a couple for "racist" content
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a complaint from a parent that a black person in the family was discriminating against her.
When the couple denies their racism, they consider the lawsuit to be baptism.
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, when she first started in 2016, she was upset to find out that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black.
"I AM a BLACK MAN", wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Placebo-Flaxman, feeling wrong, said that because of "the inconvenience", the African-American nanny did a poor job, he fired Mrs. Morris and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Maurice paid Ms. Morris a day's wages and sent her home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple who fired him to recover $350 a day for six months of uncontracted work.
"I wanted to show them that they couldn't do what I knew they could do", he told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple responded to the accusation of "racism", stating that they could not trust Maurice after the accusation and that his dismissal was a reasonable decision.
And she sent him a message, and said, I will not answer thee.
He is not racist.
We are not racist people", her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
Wouldest thou give thy children into the hand of the cruel, though thou hast sinned?
A newborn baby?
Please come".
Comparing the complaint to a midwifery, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months earlier, and that she had been in "a very difficult situation".
Would you go after something like this?
It's not a good thing", the investment banker said.
During the trial, the court of public opinion was blaming the couple for their actions and logic.
A new letter from Paddington Publishers says that readers have a misconception about talking bears.
Karen Jankel, the Bond daughter born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine yourself in the position of the person who first read it before it was published.
It's interesting to see what we know about Paddington's great success".
Noting that his father had worked as a BBC operator before he was inspired to write a children's book about the little toy bear, he was optimistic that his initiative would be rejected, and that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books would be a "bitter-tasting" victory.
Describing Paddington as a very important member of the family, his father said he was proud of his late achievement.
"He was a very quiet, modest man, not proud", he said.
"However, Paddington was so real to her, it was like having a child in you and being proud of his achievements, even though it wasn't your job.
I think that's how he evaluated Paddington's success.
It was his nature and his imagination, but he always had a respect for Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On landing, she took her daughter to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked hard to save her life.
"Ned kept calling and saying that he was sick and that he had no intention of doing this", said Mrs. Ednan-Laparez.
"Then, Ned called me and said he was going to die in two minutes, so I had to say goodbye to him.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my soul".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave him to stop his heart attack were slowly stopping working and leaving his body.
He had died many times before, and this was the last time.
I had to sit and wait for a while, knowing that all this was coming true.
I was surrounded by families and people, so I couldn't scream, cry or whistle.
I really had to keep it all inside".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperez, who was not giving up on the ordeal, got on the plane with the other passengers, weeping for the loss of her daughter.
"No one knew", he said.
I have bowed my head, and my eyes have become as a stream of tears.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a special connection to Ned during the flight.
She needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Open letters of mourning from women aimed at preventing suicides on bridges
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to save themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers, so people can call for help with the information.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and he was only 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lydney, said that her son had a great future as a chef, which she could really enjoy.
"Everyone recognized her by her smile.
They always said that her smile would brighten up any room".
But he is in darkness with his enemies, and his work is cut off before his death.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother had a baby after he had said goodbye to his life.
Mrs. Davis: "I'm constantly distracted by the effects of being hit".
Mrs. Davis made maps so people would know there were people they could go to for help, even if it was a friend they could talk to.
You need to talk to someone and get out of your own head".
Ms. Humphries, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years shortly after her mother's death.
"He never mentioned that he was depressed or that he was drowsy", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He was in the dark on Christmas Day - and the children were opening their presents and he took them away".
She said that his death was a big blow for them, but they had to go through it and work: "It destroys the family.
It's going to tear us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

With the FBI launching an investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy.
"I thought that if we could get what he asked for - a limited investigation of time and size - we would be able to create a little unity", Flake said on Saturday, noting that he feared that the Committee would break up in the midst of a partisan rift that had its roots in the abyss.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
It's just a matter of time before they don't want to come.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks on November 6 - and if the Republicans are bad as expected, they will be severely weakened in their bid to nominate a candidate for the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush, who worked in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary, called to support Kavanaugh, in an effort to influence the senators.
What happens after the FBI releases the report?
The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow him to break ties with Vice President Mike Pence and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of refugees in North Korea decreased.
The number of North Korean refugees entering South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislature said.
PakBeng-Segu, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Cooperation, said that 1127 refugees were deported last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates charged by smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that after the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally.
Many flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea - easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats displaced people not as refugees, but as illegal migrants, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
And the leaders of the two countries met at Phnian at the beginning of the month to discuss the matter.
This was the case at the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to work on the Korean peninsula to prevent nuclear proliferation under the Common Treaty.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress in US sanctions since then.
"When there is no distrust of the United States, there is no distrust of our national security, and in such circumstances, we will not allow ourselves to be unilaterally disarmed", Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and considers him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "not fit to serve on the Supreme Court".
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"If I let her do this, they will think she is crazy", Pelosi said Thursday about Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Dr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual assault against Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was at his inauguration talking about his family and his high school years, sometimes loudly and in a panic.
He also openly denounced the Democrats in the committee who accused democracy of being a "grotesque and coordinated assassination" orchestrated by the liberals who lost the 2016 presidential election to Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi convinced that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was anti-Democratic.
"I don't think he knows how to get along with these concepts and the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi, if he's confirmed, will try to implement Kavanaugh, if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, will demonstrate.
"I'm going to say this - if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he should not only be going to the Supreme Court, but in court now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi as a democracy is potentially opposed to the Affordable Care Act, the Kavanaugh decisions, or Roe v. Wade, which is considered conservative justice.
Kavanaugh, at his confirmation hearing, asked if he violated any Supreme Court decisions.
Now it is not time for the hysterical, the lying to come to judgment, and we say, It is no wonder.
And women should use it.
It's a fair diatribe, a spill of months and years, and he can't grieve it.
"When we are angry, we cry", Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
I think it's not uncommon?
And he said, He is angry with me; and when he is angry with her, he weepeth; and when he is angry, he weepeth, and saith to him that spoke to him, I am sad, for I weep.
I have a stomach ache. 
And he continued.
And then I thought, well, that was good.
The eyes of the wicked are filled with tears, because they do not understand.
One of the most memorable moments of my early work in an office where men are busy is when I was crying with a lot of anger, when an elderly woman, whom I always dreaded, grabbed me by my chain and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't let them know you're crying", he told me.
They don't know you're a friend.
They think you're in a bad mood and they're happy to see you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential race.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called "Aim Business" and dropped out of the race. Mrs. Schroeder was so upset that she decided she had no reason to study the presidential race.
"It was a poorly thought out decision", he recalled with a laugh 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, but they needed another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Projects".
Because he was late in the campaign, he missed the fundraiser, and he said he wouldn't run until he had two million dollars.
He was losing the fight.
He realized that his friends who had offered him $1,000 might have offered him $250.
"Do they think I've been given a break?"
When she announced she would not run, she was overwhelmed with emotion, thanking the people who had supported her, not out of anger at the sexism that had stifled her, but out of anger at the system that had made it difficult for her to raise funds and reach out to voters.
"You can imagine how nervous I was", Ms. Schroeder recalled, "and how the press affected her.
"When Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put in my grave.
 Does she cry?
What benefits could a trade war between the US and China bring to Beijing?
While the start of the US-China trade war has shaken the world, it is doubtful that it will end anytime soon, and experts say that the long-term separation between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing.
US President  Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's most important export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The price increases were accelerated this week by new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, which is about half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has taken similar measures, for example, the last time it imposed tariffs on US goods worth 60 billion dollars, ranging from five to ten percent, in response to the harsh US tariffs.
China has promised to compete with the United States, but the star of the world's second largest economy doesn't seem to be shining anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw would cause unsatisfactory demands, but turning to the US would be very uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if the pressure from the US is prolonged, Beijing can play its "card" well, which can have a positive impact on China by weakening economic interdependence.
"The rash political decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that could bring down the economies of any of these countries, which is much more dangerous than outside observers suggest", said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia Center of the New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister says ready to return refugees
Syria has said it is only ready to return voluntarily and has asked for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Nations, Walid al-Muwalem, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation in the country has become stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists.
At present, all conditions are created for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at the daily life and livelihood of the population.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muwalem said that the Syrian regime would welcome anyone who would help rebuild the rebel-held country.
However, he noted that he would not receive aid from countries that help by signing treaties or sponsoring uprisings.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the final at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
This is the sixth time the US team has lost the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish team, captained by Thomas Bjørn, had reclaimed the victory crown when they scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The USA's star forward Phil Mickelson was performing well throughout the tournament, and he managed to get the ball down on the 16th hole of the third pair, thus passing the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been a brilliant all round golfer, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record in the current format of the tournament, which was established in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit, with a score of 5 & 4, lost to the Danish Torbjærn Olesen, who had the lowest rating in the European team.
World number one Dustin Johnson beat England's Ian Poulter 2-1 in what may be his last appearance in the Ryder Cup.
Serhio Garcia, a seven-time Ryder Cup veteran, won the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
"I don't usually hold back my tears, but today I can't hold back my tears.
It was a very difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for his trust in me.
I can't believe I got the trophy back, I'm so happy.
I'm happy to help my team", said Garcia, who won the European Cup.
He handed the relay to John Ram, who defeated American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in the individual event.
"I'm proud to have won Tiger Woods, I'm a kid who grew up watching him play", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and finished with a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
That's a pretty good statistic for one of the most legendary players in history, having won 14 major titles and beaten only Jack Nicklaus twice.
The players of the US national team, besides Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, were on a quest for a ferry all weekend, and the three of them showed a high level of play throughout the tournament.
After the poor performance of his teammates, the captain of the US national team, Jim Furyk, said: "I am proud of the guys, they fought to the end".
This morning, we had a moment that shook Europe.
We are defeated.
I have a lot of Thomas.
He is a real captain.
The 12 players who followed him also did well.
We're going to rebuild the team, we're going to work closely with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're just going to keep moving forward.
I love all 12 players and it is a great honor to captain them.
You have to bow your head.
We played a lot".
