Police from Karratha arrested 20 year olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km / h in a 70 km / h area and through scrubland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km / h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before turning into the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the rider's description were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal and driving recklessly.
He is scheduled to appear before the district court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the indictment by the Glasgow Supreme Court at a hearing.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and could not signal agreement."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae scheduled the hearing for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Recollection of the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to establish trade union organisation as a civil right.
“As unions die, middle-class jobs die, ” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I proudly present the Employee Authorisation Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in case of discrimination on the grounds of trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - thus stopping anti-union forces.
The amendment of the national labour law law to create a possibility for workers subjected to discrimination to organise trade union representation, to sue a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when that country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that democracy would replace Hedki Tojo ’ s militarised autocracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "workers' rights to unification and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would replace Adolf Hitler ’ s fascism with a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause stating explicitly: "The right to form associations to secure and improve labor and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or aim to restrict this right are null and void; such measures are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and then to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
Indeed, with these rights under attack in America, it is very wise to recall the American ideal that working people must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A US federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five of the state ’ s abortion clinics.
This measure, which was enacted by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and is due to take effect on September 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire the right to hospitalize patients at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge ’ s decision, however, means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions for the time being, while applying for such a right.
“Plaintiffs may continue to operate in conformity with the law as they strive to obtain these rights, ” wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his ruling.
A hearing for the judge will be scheduled within one month to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortionists welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of verdicts against similar measures, saying that doctors would gain more time to obtain hospital admittance rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are missing out on a devious law that wants to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two hospitals, who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi recently declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key elements of a Texas law that would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortionists and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that referral rights require unnecessary restrictions on doctors.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures are designed to protect women ’ s health, although some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only a doctor performing abortions in Louisiana has the right to refer patients, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would not perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their applications for patient referral rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments result in higher rates of death from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video homage online for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are more likely to die of ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1,100 Australians who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research Director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
LITTLE STUDY: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing medical conditions, and social and economic status also affected her chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and they are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances, she suggested as a possible remedy a reinforcement of the service of flown in doctors, in order to give specialists the opportunity to care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study found poor long-term survival rates in women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and underlined the need for better treatment and screening strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining numbers of homeowners
The decline, together with a greater decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products", according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden.
The increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular practice of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes and the decrease in garden size are other factors threatening the industry, where an estimated £5 billion is sold annually.
In the London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% over a six-year period, the lowest household outlays are reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Advisor for RHS, said: "Containers are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move."
HTA ’ s report identified the period 1997-2005 as the “golden age ” of garden retail, owing to rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri, continues.
Around 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV in the capital Islamabad.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could push the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter ceased operation for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometer away, they delivered themselves equipped with sticks and stones collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif ’ s resignation, but Sharif rejects it.
Meanwhile, the country ’ s army calls for a political solution to the conflict “without wasting time and without resorting to violence. ”
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already staged several coups.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of having cheated in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to move to Sharif ’ s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for espionage report
Turkey ’ s State Department has summoned the country ’ s longest-serving US diplomat to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the chargé d ’ affaires of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for U.S. and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that targeted Germany ’ s most important intelligence service, Ankara, caused the Turkish government to react much more angrily.
Warning strike: train drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The cancellation announced for 18 to 21 Clock affects all transport companies nationwide, including the long-distance, Regional and S,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the German locomotive driver's union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect considerable losses.
There were no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences concretely.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the town of Calvià to the office of the Majorca Prosecutor.
The chief of police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge "Drinking" Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, following allegations of corruption.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Majorcan Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are being questioned together with Navarro by a judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the disgruntled nightclub owners said that the cronyism of the authorities had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer with a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist drinking fellatio with 24 men.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic bar tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organiser Carnage had to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
SPRING has given South Australia a wintry surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening to 21 o'clock fell further 5mm rain on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down in the night to Sunday.
The final precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a shower that started just before 8pm and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After last week ’ s winter provided an early dose of spring, the city ’ s temperatures dropped to a peak of just 15.8 ° C on Monday.
The gusty weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 o'clock, but was hit by a shearing wind - a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At this time, gusts of wind reached about 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off during a second landing and finally touched down at about 8.40 p.m.
The delay resulted in the delay of a number of other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: High time for large cross-linking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the handset to the phone, and I think: Wow, how retro is that?
But there is a consideration behind this: if the cable were not, all listeners would fly around the house without a master in no time, and that would be even more retro.
Anyway, applies to the ekeltronischen (ekeltronischen?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electronic waste of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And those who, for example, still have a CRT television in the living room today, simply say that they reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the arrival of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who once blindly mastered washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out before him with unbelievably vain expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Can we still do it?
What are we to talk about with people who seem to voluntarily spread such a message?
Basically, for the past 20 years or so, the most important thing has been that we should be very obliged to network our house.
So that the yoghurt orders itself, so that the fire detector tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we got the air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But soon a dream will come true: We lift our wristwatch, say "Suck!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner starts.
I am mistaken.
Everything comes down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring", whispers an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with headphones, the steam oven sends the weather forecast and the data glasses show how long the pizza will still take in the oven, which is of no use because we are stuck in traffic jams.
From daily practice we also know: If a new-fangled device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the telephone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
After the war in Gaza, Israeli children return to their schools
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in air raid shelters, while rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza were closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school year brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the rocket-fired communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a bit scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit strange" to suddenly go back to school.
"Those were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire last week interrupted the war, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, heavily marked by Palestinian bombardment.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said “we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you safety. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas ’ s call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza ’ s air and sea ports.
Israel is calling for Hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting to be handed over.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are combatants, but has not provided any concrete evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area, and some 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fighting continues, last week the education authorities postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After elections in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl puts NPD prohibition procedures in question
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, the CDU has appealed to Federal Vice-President Thomas Strobl for an end to the ongoing NPD proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU, Federal Vice-President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU leader in Baden-Württemberg, to the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that would rather lead me to conclude that we are fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In Sunday ’ s vote, the NPD narrowly missed the five percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because at that time the Verfassungsschutz also had top informants in the NPD.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz refugees are now housed in tents.
The first reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Internal Affairs Department has set up three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were informed only shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions fuel further reservations of the citizens and give the district politicians no possibility to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees", says for example Britta Herrmann, leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens in the Harburg district meeting.
Your party demands that the district administration Harburg currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial admission are the rush of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, according to a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP ’ s Monday data.
Due to this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tier market.
RP Data ’ s figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, compared to 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale lies Canberra, which has been hard hit by cuts in government spending, with prices rising by just 1.4% over the year.
Mr. Lawless also said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which would put the market "under a real test".
"If you look at the persistently high auction price, a generally fast selling rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse newspaper, he contradicts the statements of the managing director, Peer Medau, and accuses him of posing "like a general".
The communication states that this is not the style of the university.
The Medau family, for example, had already been "informed orally about the university ’ s intentions in mid-June.
The statement that the plans only became known in July is definitely wrong ", said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not 'predetermined or even decided', but that there are 'preferences'.
Also the necessary extension of the narrow road up to the castle is less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is no mention of a nine-metre-wide street.
As things stand at present, it is about 5.50 metres, which is one metre wider than before, "explains Pötzl.
Pötzl refuses to accept the argument of the Medau ’ s operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will in future only be used by university students.
It is not parked at all, because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking of the residents
According to the president of the university, the Bergwichtel crèche, which is located on the grounds and in front of whose front door the access to the parking deck would lead, is "not to be impaired".
Rather, he points out, "that this is not just about the crèche, but also about the residents at the junction with Friedrich Foerde Streib Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
It is therefore about much more than the particular interests of the Medau gentlemen ", said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' advisory board of the crèche, with the development of the road one "of the few natural spots of Coburg would be lost" is justified, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Authority, will inform the city councillors about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and address the importance of the new development in this context".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the crèche about the plans of the school.
Access to the new parking deck will not be via the campus and the Friedrich Streib Straße, as was previously the case, but via Medau ’ Berg.
Thus the narrow road would have to be developed on approximately one kilometer of length two-lane.
According to projections by the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There are about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg, Handewitt led for this decision above all health problems.
The decision was not easy for me, it matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team, "said the 2007 world champion on his Facebook page.
With a total of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany, he is thus entering international retirement.
Because the throw-powerful backspace player for the Champions' League winner from Flensburg wants to go a few more years on goal hunt, he is now the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson no longer available.
Glandorf had a “long and good conversation ” with the Icelander, who announced his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-time fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available also in the next years healthy, for it longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which does not permit the current double load.
The left-hander even had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers leave no trace.
I have some health building sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got a grip on my blood pressure.
There are a number of other complaints about wear and tear.
Already at the beginning of the year I realized that I can control my head, but not deceive my body ", Glandorf explained in an interview to the magazine" Handball Time ".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
“If all ropes tear, I am always ready for discussion ”, explained the two-fold family father to the specialized magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospitalization in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career I would like to be able to leave at least to some extent.
In addition to winning the World Championships in 2007 and the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also won Flensburg the European Cup Winners' Cup.
German economy contracted by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
From April to the end of June 2014, the gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter.
The Federal Statistical Office reported this and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, GDP for the first half of the year was up 0.8 percent on the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland" Mooiste, which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The castle town Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycling federation of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande".
It is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist's paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked with their registration with Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this round trip by the cathedral country.
This tour was advertised in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove over night to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way ", the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club house of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace drive" through the city over the wall, where also the start took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents ", Heinz Lölfing summarizes a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015, hopefully with nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend", the cyclists promised to come back to the Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Constantine Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, what Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, former prisoner, has brought in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages on paper.
The Munich native, born on June 1, 1947, wrote his memoirs not chronologically, but more thought-fragments for thought-fragments, each chapter introduced by a suitable song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from masturbation as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves out no human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
There are also abstract but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom of, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was influenced not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also by his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the bon vivant Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "through subtraction", as he says, "by omitting all that is unnecessary".
Between all these high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes to earth: for example about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or an insane drive by car in which he aimed head-on at a tree.
Here, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move on!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket match.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was the serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's time, he did gain an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It is lighter now, but they are dark, smoky, deep stylish labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry off.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to put the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
Only when my mother was in trouble towards the end of her life did we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Daddy, I am 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry ’ s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is taken over by the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him on New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in his profession.
Not only did I have to grow up before the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 I had to learn how to become an efficient joy-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
It was very unpleasant for my family.
I somehow wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "light, award-winning pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show went on air in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, television, and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC ’ s LennyHenry.tv series, he thought, “What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you ’ re just passing the time or stepping on the spot. ”
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was predominantly a domain of the middle class, white in tights and a cabbage in front of it.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said "You should give it a try.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few words in your mouth and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry listed 20 lines from Othello ’ s last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt that I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on.
"That's it, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me" You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they fix the computer "."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside of me said "Oh, thank God".
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That was also well received, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a THEREOF voice.
So I stick to it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is pervaded by humorous outbursts while he imitates characters again and again.
I have decided not to do any stand up ’ comedy because I find that this kind of immediate gratification from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for that, you drive it to a wall.
Sometimes I perform live at the Apollo, when I feel like it, but overall I don ’ t get as much as I used to.
I ask him if he will ever do another booth, a comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that ’ s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Hittite rebels block roads in Yemen ’ s capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Houthi and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital, Sana ’ a.
Hittite supporters squatted central streets in Sana'a on Monday, a spokesman for the Hittite "Ansar Allah" party said.
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
The Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi, the leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi called for action on Sunday evening.
According to the newspaper, Huthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shia Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps along the major access roads to Sana ’ a.
Bloody fighting with the Yemeni army continues in the surrounding area.
Kenya registers officials to curb "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to delete "ghost employees" from the government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would not be paid, according to a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to receive salaries even after leaving the civil service.
When President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013, he promised to fight corruption in the civil service.
An audit earlier this year found at least $1 million (£700,000) lost per month in payments to "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the civil service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC in the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at Identification Centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be recorded through biometric registrations, was reported in a government message.
Those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication went on to say.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the civil service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and also by cleaning up the payroll at both levels of government - eliminating 'ghost workers'," said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi ’ s founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding EUR 19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil lawsuit at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
This was announced by a court speaker on Monday.
According to the statement of claim, Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and Berthold Albrecht had calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
Thus also the agreed upon commission had turned out higher.
Achenbach bought valuable objects for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school service for 44 years, 23 of which as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many experienced Petershausen students and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see the human being in the pupil.
Sněžka is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, after four years of secondary school, he became interested in teaching.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
The family had to leave their home within half an hour.
After a few months in a camp they went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight car.
So Richter ended up in the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week, ten kilometers to the next train station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleep in a red cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first state examination and in 1954, after three years as a teacher, the second state examination.
Since Upper Franconia did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school building.
In 1958 he moved into the newly built teacher ’ s house next to the school, where he lived in three rooms.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen and five classes in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968 / 69, these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrading in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Richter ’ s retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the mayor at the time, Ludwig Götz, who had a workshop built at the cost of the community and cellar rooms when the building was extended in 1997, although this was not eligible for subsidies according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very friendly to schools," Richter remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had replied to a lecture by a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter put into practice what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84 year-old.
And he had to learn: "It's not always possible." Whether he means just his pupils or his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter ’ s actions were sometimes unconventional.
When pupils beat each other, they were not punished by him, nor were they sentenced to sit down.
At the expense of the congregation Richter had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the sake of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship as principal with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he persuaded the non-party judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last candidate on the CSU parliamentary list.
But Richter was selected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4 / 700 cyclists stop at the Kurpark in Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists stop in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten on their tour, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of people resting alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 ’ bike tour including escort enjoyed a break in the lower spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in Schotten ’ s Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday things got serious: the cyclists started the first stage, the 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by the mayor of Bad Vilbel, Hans Peter Seum, who had participated by bike, and the manager of the Bad Salzhausen company, Petra Schwing, Döring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder, Mockstadt, had baked 85 trays of apple, plum, streusel and cheese cake, which the fit cyclists loved wonderfully.
"Only rural women can bake such cakes," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be purchased at the beverage stand of the Geiß Gymnastics Club in Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and won enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
One gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all he has today already bolted bicycle chains back".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the operations manager still had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the Trinkkurhaus and used the opportunity to advertise Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Also graduation boss Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 is bicycle tour 2004 as tour leader with us, could only take a short breather, he had to do nevertheless plentifully with the technology locally.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated by means of three telephones and a radio with his employees and the 15 headed motorcycle squadron of the police Hesse, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine", he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia have cyclists come.
The number of participants depends a little on the available accommodation capacities.
In category I the participants will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the health resort when they started again after one and a half hours: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After the arrival in Schotten the group was allowed a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS) the park had received a nice festive atmosphere and of course delicacies such as tarte flambée with well-cooled feather white had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS ’ s Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC ’ s Chairman Wolfgang Wagner ’ s Sachs in his function as a board member of ADAC Hessen ’ s Thuringia welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many businesses in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporty activity on the bicycle, the opportunity for swinging movement under the open sky was eagerly used.
Increasingly, the guests were mingled with the citizens, who were just as impressed by the good mood as the large group of cyclists.
On the second day the cyclists had the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - on their agenda.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", report local media agencies.
The police authorities made no direct comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly founding an organised criminal organisation and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People ’ s Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk which visited Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their further life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC has perhaps found the great director it needs.
It arrives with a proud trail of glory from the banking world, media management and the Tory Party ’ s inner circle.
And it has its own frontal experience.
She began her career at Bain and Co., a global management consulting firm, before joining Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top job of the parent company, Pearson, went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation allegedly amounted to almost £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
It was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councilman.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: internally on the first guard of the BBC ’ s own management hierarchy, but also externally as the voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for complete and comprehensive reform.
But what new chairman would risk running, hitting everything, and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps losing his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that weren ’ t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC downsized – power, money, and status outdated.
As the competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of the BBC ’ s royalties is particularly dangerous.
For a modest £145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is surely the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 per cent of all households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
And the BBC seems to be rising again on the popularity scale: 53% support it today, up from 31% 10 years ago.
Viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas Says Disparaging Tweet Was Not Authorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the Democratic District Attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry's account, which denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
Perry staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets came from Perry ’ s official account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, Rosemary Lehmberg, District Attorney of Travis County, was given an unfavourable picture, convicted of drunkenness at the wheel in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding for her office when she refused to resign, leading to charges against Perry – who may be a 2016 presidential candidate – in front of a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I'm not always drunk with the three-fold alcohol level... but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry when he flouts it."
I am the most drunken democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg ’ s office was not charged with directing the Grand Jury ’ s investigation against Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special attorney from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political ploy.
His high-calibre team of legal counsel asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law in place to prosecute the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas was indiscriminately vague.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funding to the state ’ s Public Integrity Unit – based in Travis County and investigating state corruption in Texas – when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provoked a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at Iowa Electoral Assemblies during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market "normal" again
One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to huge price hikes, prompting the Bank of England to cap mortgage lending in June, owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013," adding that this provides a "stable operating environment."
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
According to information from the cadastral office, prices in the urban area alone jumped by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average retail prices at Berkeley ’ s private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about one-fifth last year to £423,000 at the end of April.
But a stronger pound in recent months has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villa tax" ahead of the May general election.
Foxton ’ s London real estate agent warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which presented tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to slower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Monday ’ s new data from the Bank of England show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise of property prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening house price consciousness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now decreased year on year by a quarter, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, as the amounts due for forward sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and forward sales remained stable as a result."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April – nearly a third more than its 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £280 million and revenue by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday prior to the Company's Annual Meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that Berkeley's revenues in the current year are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
The analysts unanimously estimate the annual pre-tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley ’ s shares were fixed at £23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's performance at the 85th Academy Awards Ceremony.
Naked photos of Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures from another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan sharing page, were allegedly procured through a gap in Apple ’ s iCloud online storage system. Apple ’ s alleged “master list ” of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary“ Kate Olsen, ” reported BuzzFeed.
It ’ s not certain how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim vs The Rest of the World ” on Twitter, also denounced the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private surroundings of our house - I hope you are really happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FAKES, folks.
Let ’ s fight back the beginnings. * pun intended *.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, that was the best way to describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that was left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was thorny, as in hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this spikiness was an affair just beginning, which had been more promising than usual for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling, delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt and who had inherited a piece of land in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, there were still spiders in the baths, slugs had left their traces on all the windows and believed that all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbages.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding her hands on the broken deck chairs in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had latched absent-mindedly into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, as the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had enjoyed listening to while shutters were closed in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their very own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolesced, just as the word obsolescent.
Common taste created what edicts and precepts would never have done, and just as in books people choose from the dishwasher to the millionaire, from memoirs, cookbooks, and romance novels, so in music they chose ballads.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailinn's big feet in a roughly comical serenade.
Ailinn did not understand that.
"It was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even though it was not directly forbidden.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be quite sure where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group endowment - gratefully as those spared by fate.
People with African Caribbean origins were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were, as if by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a functioning service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks broke plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT HAPPEN IF IT WAS HAPPENED - fearing that they would be charged with firing, fearing that the flames would consume them next - had opened restaurants, considered themselves, and become depressed with inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbonate leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers to her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a bit weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Keverns view.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncombed raven black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early.
"Your fat ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I am a bit perverted.
That didn ’ t sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the comforting charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deck chair, threw down the console, and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her agitation she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in a storm.
"And your stubborn is exactly the reason why I feel perverted towards you", she said...
Except that I am not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke on the shore here and there.
The same confused men, with still thicker skins and more annoying for WHAT HAPPEN than their forefathers had been as smugglers and beach robbers, went from bar to bar, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a big fist if she had not paid attention!
They first smooch - smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - they first smooch and then beat.
According to Keverns, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the smooching itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt leaded, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him as he moved away - as her companion watched him from a room on the upper floor - a man, weighed down by something he himself had summoned.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just narrated, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative watchdog of public opinion, worked on a brief lecture on the continuation of low- and medium-level violence in precisely those parts of the country where its reduction, if not elimination, is most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"Much has been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggression of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely historically been felt, despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some characteristics turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the steeple, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to arouse.
The people weep as they listen to sentimental ballads, inebriate themselves in stories of difficulties overcome, and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former crudeness hold the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious contention at home, at work, on the streets, and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said after reading the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esme again invoked her right to privacy and refusal of testimony.
Feminists?
Again silence.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is an unbiased workplace.
We serve an unprejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in themselves perfectly acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results such as those you have presented.
You yourselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "sneaky" and "raw", could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
If one rides on WHAT HAS HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if, if it had happened, it had happened yesterday, it means taking away from the land its essential vital force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED sign in flamingo pink repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country for the past quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, cherish your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you are aiming at," replied Esme Nussbaum calmly as she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I am saying nothing other than that we have not yet been healed as effectively as we are pretending to ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to THE WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, it is not the others in whom we express our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angel's patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe actions as" mistakes "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you say that they have left out their "anger" and their "distrust" of "others".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about 'us' and 'others'.
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of that, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to say, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I accuse no one.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as there is no guilt to be assigned, there is no need to redeem guilt if such redemption is appropriate and if there is a way to redeem it.
But what is the use of the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I may say anything,
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, as she was going to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven on the sidewalk in a kind of "brutal fury."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho Military Member Says No Coup Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied that they had planned a coup d ’ état to overthrow the government, saying they were attacking police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the country ’ s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" who were about to be armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that after receiving several intelligence reports, the Defence Force of Lesotho was acting, within the police, a few elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had given the impression of an overthrow.
"Although no one claimed to have usurped the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Military spokesmen from Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were withdrawing to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is assuming leadership during Thabane ’ s absence.
Thabane said that he believed he had been targeted for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been great tension in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to clashes in his unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the euro zone on a 13-month low
The increase in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined, and factories experienced collapses at a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to come up with a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the eurozone and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB head Mario Draghi could provide further information later this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, along the lines of what the UK and the US did during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The PMI factory for Germany, Russia ’ s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc ’ s second largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a problem child, as does Italy ’ s descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer effective is also not reassuring ", Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to stoke the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said for the August Procurement Manager Index of Manufacturing in the Eurozone is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the euro area seem to find life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence - and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said that it is "increasingly likely" that the ECB will eventually have to introduce some sort of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and then turned, surprisingly, into action and hope for the future in the midst of dire misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl photographed trying to climb back into the destroyed school gym
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and became famous when she tried to climb back into the destroyed school sports hall only in her underwear after a mine had exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she felt completely cured, but she said yesterday, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I am afraid that I will have to be operated on again.
Some shell splinters are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people, as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says belligerently.
"That happened to me, and you can't change it.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory gets weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back to school online, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she might be dead, he fled and saw a weeping toddler on the way, took her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who embraced his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality Tamara had stumbled outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After reunification, she said, "I cried with joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now-defunct News of the World) to win the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it gets paler in my memory.
I remember that right after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn ’ t make it outside.
We never say that they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop, where I could choose what I wanted and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighbourhood have been killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember Damir wanting to eat borsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not seeking revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn ’ t like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my legs, I looked around and saw hell all around me, with parts of my body all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I called to him," Damir, run, run away, "but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the horrors of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: Beslan ’ s survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodstained face was scarred as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother, 54 year-old Fatima, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried off to take her elder son Vladimir to university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy was left there alone for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's a long time ago, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Impressive: The image of George (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day so much. He said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgy does not like the picture, and it is hidden on the bookshelf at home.
I understand this, but I also believe that it is thanks to this image that people all over the world feel our pain.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can not understand how this is possible, because if you ask people no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the gym when September 1st is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friend.
It is hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not feel sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20
The Boy Who Survived Though He Was Trapped at the Feet of a Murderous Terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage caused by the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I must say that is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous painting.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don ’ t like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically I am fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including medical documents, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the commemoration ceremony.
I know that Georgy will not go.
It must be even more violent for him, because he was there and I was not.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me. Everyone here in Beslan is marked by it.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is difficult to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can walk, but he cannot exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege and this only intensifies my pain.
I have lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families in which new children have been born, but also of widows who have never remarried.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many more are being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, 10
The baby that was carried so poignantly to safety by a special task force
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian special task force (left).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004, when baby Alyona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona ’ s mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, who he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbours.
"You are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of running over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for crossing a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of running into a girl on the Pittenween crossing in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr Steward steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC filed the case for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most economical option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action-packed cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available for less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed.
You can also adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes to optimize exposure time for dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our purchasing guide and ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Do multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that you can use to compose pictures, action cams usually don ’ t.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you do a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that allows you to take a number of shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The further you move away from the surface, the worse the light gets.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions.
It ’ s especially important when you ’ re working with an action-packed cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they ’ re to fill the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organisation as the NHS.
As an advisory anaesthetist, he dedicated his career to sparing the sick from both the agony of illness and the torment of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and illnesses, while those being treated are predominantly preoccupied with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty gathering myself.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently blamed his wife Juliet.
"I would rather have everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusually and unreasonably disturbed.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an x-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the epidermis, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is asbestos exposure - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle material" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can easily ignore.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960 ’ s, when the industry voluntarily agreed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, this disease kills twice as many people as traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not confined to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and often still is, present in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn, and the shops where we shop.
And so mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions, or ages.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not shelters.
Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, the source of this deadly carcinogen has already been identified.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
Indeed, he found it hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was trained for six years," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have had mesothelioma for the past five years," he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the last one alive."
How many more of us will fall ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55th
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomas die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will fall ill?"
The UK ’ s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease between 1870 and 2050, when the UK asbestos epidemic is expected to stall.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for compensation, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she joined M & S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbesti form", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and the WHO to be a 'major health risk' with the possibility of death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto ’ s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the persons concerned, in which it is shown that "a substantial proportion of the mesotheliomas without known exposure was caused by work or in the house presumably by asbestos contact in the environment."
According to him, a large part of these contacts is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks as if no one can assume that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government might have been unwittingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movement".
Members of Parliament are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work must be done over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
Goddard ’ s report also pointed out that “the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant regulations. ”
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to pinpoint exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50 year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were approved," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked and the dates.
What he remembers is the day in early December 2009 when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45 and had an operation just late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was caused by the pleura, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took x-rays of his chest and applied pleural cathethers to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient from Abbott came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott ’ s condition worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between the rib and thoracic skins.
I am an optimist.
I usually just carry on, "he says.
To be honest, I didn ’ t worry that much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was available in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan ’ s nurses, one of whom recommended that he take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos, ” he says.
The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many workers who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson), or who ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely exposed to the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for doctors treating them.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it is not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Also schools.
Indeed, many people may have had their first contact with asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The subject of asbestos in schools is now frequently mentioned on websites.
Meanwhile, so many innocent objects in our homes, such as flooring or scale-roofs, have asbestos as standard.
"It is an industrial poison that is present in much of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch out as you tear down your shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that, ” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas.
The biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to absorb all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor" how long do I have? "
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it then. "
Mesothelioma is especially insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the breastskin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the needle-shaped asbestos fibres inhaled," says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiopathyroid physician who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Ironically, the very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated a few others who were presumably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is invasive by nature from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly debated.
Some say that it is worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out your breastskin," he says.
They cannot get around it with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy", which "has an effect", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and counseling bureau for those with mesothelioma.
"Hello, cancer center", he introduced himself cheerfully with calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy, lasting four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed "to make things appear a little more positive."
After consulting several physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang, a cardiac specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in not having to be referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and would have to wait for approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma in order to benefit from the best therapies available.
But when these treatments eventually fail, many of those affected are left with another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 ’ s was to recognize that even very low exposure posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
Indeed, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, assigning the fatal asbestos contact to a company or job – usually decades after the incidents – is a huge problem.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been significant new laws this year that make it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers can no longer be found.
The law has set up a £350 million insurance industry-funded fund for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 with contact but unable to sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal compensation trial - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications to the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million is a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
“This is a deal between insurers and insurers, ” he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not passed by and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labor and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action was needed to deal with seven deaths a day.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang, Lazdunski, for 19 months.
After their first consultation, Lang ’ s Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a triple-dose therapy that enables Lang ’ s Lazdunski to present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“That ’ s one of the most important things, of course, ” says Abbott.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There is something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer ， spots around my chest.
I just got 50th
This is not life threatening.
That is the end of life.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler timing works.
If you get bad news, you become negative.
They have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease with which I would not grow old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon received many phone calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for those with mesothelioma, such conversations are not permeated with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The illness brings (like Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to a government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite increased calls for democratic reform, the Chinese parliament voted against the Hong Kong electorate ’ s nomination of candidates for the 2017 election.
This move is likely to fuel long-announced protests in Hong Kong ’ s business district, while activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision by China ’ s People ’ s Congress basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, Democratic Party chair.
That is not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents elect the government presidency from 2017.
China ’ s leaders presented Sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives Hong Kong ’ s citizens direct voting rights, but the decision also makes clear that China ’ s leaders hold firm to the process through a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
Under a new clause, moreover, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong in several years have taken place.
The pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close off the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organisers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they gave no details, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers stated that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action to take place only when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday in front of the government building there were tighter security measures, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is intensified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong ’ s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy ’ s Central Movement for endangering Hong Kong ’ s lifeblood.
"The protests they talk about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China ’ s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong ’ s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region ’ s history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the USA is now being carried over to the universities, where Freshmen performances with the private aircraft are offered.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK ’ s first luxury travel service for today ’ s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesman said that there are no new bookings yet, as the service has just been launched, but added that "students will book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also announced that it expects a market for this offering despite the £9,000 per annum tuition fees.
Students today are very different in their expectations and aspirations from the students of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as detached.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting their studies this month are facing a cost of living crisis, as available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with soaring bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists criticize Ferguson ’ s race and police behavior
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in white feminist online discussions.
In her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
But while tensions increased in the Midwest and gained attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women were 100% racial.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the 9 August shootings, the personal essays entitled "Thoughts on Ferguson by a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who talk about being white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnical that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women face every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating themes; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the division between black and white women came at the point where white women campaigners for women ’ s suffrage, like Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late years of the nineteenth century and found that the fight for suffrage could succeed only for one group at a time: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to stand up for women ’ s suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks was to come later, ” Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes powerfully aware of why colored women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to Ferguson ’ s questions – police behavior, racial discrimination – is a reflection of the times when white feminists played “catch ” on the problems that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to bring up a child as seriously as they do the right to conception control?" Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what this means.
Well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of The Guardian, demanding more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel, reason to understand an inherent danger to the body - and who cite opinions about the race that are vastly different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
While Steinen stands for a more intersectional feminism that addresses racial as well as gender issues, some of her comments on racial issues in America are puzzled.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stein's remarks about Ferguson contradict her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country ’ s southwest border this year, immigration reform is also coming to the surface – this time as a women ’ s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to revisit the issue as an essential women ’ s issue, she simply had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are echoed in women's organisations," she said.
"Pigs" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it was a large pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
This detached one bedroom house is located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
One of the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which also belonged a pig that had bedded its head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was erroneously published and has since been removed," said a spokeswoman for the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale aroused interest in social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
Harvey City after winning the lottery is home to a new millionaire
A lottery player from Harvey is set for this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with one lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday ’ s lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey pulled the jackpot for the second time in five years in the first-division draw, after winning $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has yet to register.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit provided for topics of conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city doesn ’ t talk about anything else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WAAs have celebrated winners in the first division over the past month, a fitting conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple from Belmont had achieved a mega win of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the prize allowed them to travel around the world and buy a new house.
The billionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Römertag in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain showers and the autumnal cold and let themselves be completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful round of representations, performances, plays, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial art troupe from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men into the ring for a heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
At first it was the turn of the "Provocators" with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg splint on the left leg and arm splint on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and root plant as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who started with net, trident and dagger against the "Secutor" and pushed the guy to the ground after a short fight.
Then the swords crashed metallic against each other, the shields clattered and the roots flew buzzing through the arena, so that one could fear and worry about the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman town, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of it were also to be marveled at at the Römertag, for instance "Aquädukt ò Marmor" from the eleven meter high and 1400 meter long Römerkanal, which stood once near Lüftelberg.
Frontinus ’ society confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: “We still benefit today from the knowledge of the past. ”
This is also confirmed by the diploma Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original Hypocaust, the hot air heating system that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressive are also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footprints made of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for the Preservation of Monuments and Sites at the Landesverband Rheinland unearthed the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
Enclosure walls of an agricultural building with a kiln for drying grain and malting were found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a dainty necklace.
According to Morscheiser, the villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD until the Germanic invasion of the then Roman Rhineland.
With it, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today ’ s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal pencils on wax boards, as the Roman pupils once did.
At the booth of the Römerthermen Zülpich the children could lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the booth of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach and serve a heavy stone wheat mill at the booth of the Naturzentrum Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
The visitors drove through the amusement park in the true-to-life replica Roman coach drawn by two cold-blooded horses and passed the impressive stand of the Municipal High School, which presented the results of its "Romans" project weeks ".
With a Roman Week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Rhineland-wide proclamation of the Roman Year 2014, which is intended to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereinen and the Wachtberger Wanderungsverein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes will be offered to remind visitors of Wachtberg ’ s Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the draughty Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era and a witty lesson is offered in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Teutons" and Romans who have moved in.
The Adendorf elementary school dedicates itself in the context of a project week to the Roman topic.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made tangible again.
A small presentation in the Wachtberg town hall will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matron shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is weighing on West Africa ’ s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are deserted - and international companies are distanced.
The devastating Ebola epidemic dealt a severe blow to West Africa ’ s economy.
The harvest is rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are deserted - the virus has severely affected the region.
Also some international enterprises go already on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
“It ’ s a total disaster, we ’ re losing a lot of money, ” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing at the second largest market in Liberia ’ s capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola come onto the market.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people dying here alone.
The health authorities recently declared that the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died and thousands more became infected.
Foreign companies are withdrawing employees
Throughout resource-rich countries, companies are suspending operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers also react: only a few merchants still leave their hometowns in order to obtain supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, rot in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is in short supply
“People will travel less and less, ” says Phillipe De Vreyer, West African economics expert in Paris.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore feels the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, is threatened with damage to its image - with far-reaching consequences.
According to Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris, the biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time.
The decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may get the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also burdens the strained state budgets of states
The disease also weighs heavily on the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health care system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged $60 million (€45 million) to help the affected countries ’ health systems.
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not yet been affected.
But many people are already staying at home elsewhere for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Shooting Association "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations for the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Schützenverein Tannenwald are in full swing from 12 to 14 September.
A big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned on Friday, September 12.
On Saturday at 18 clock is the big Böllerschießen.
Afterwards in the big marquee there will be an evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Brass band provides for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive divine service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large parade at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the prize-giving of the national and regional shootings.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festival ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
The festival is under the patronage of Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from the year 1907, when the association for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room-shooting and small caliber shooting" was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had ordered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men met again, and on 30 April they launched the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau in the Lukas inn.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting masters through a difficult beginning, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in autumn 1965 the shooting club started in the guest house "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sport shooters, who were meanwhile organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records tumbled every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club club "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the board of directors at that time under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
On May 8, 1988, after 2700 hours of work, Father Strasser blessed the new trenches.
One of the great highlights in the club ’ s history was certainly the 44th Gauschießen, combined with the ceremonial consecration of the new marksmen ’ s flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
1995 a Böllergruppe was created.
Josef Schmalzl became a consultant.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the organization of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association modernised the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year, thereby bringing them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting performances of the Schützenverein.
Currently, eleven teams take part in the round competitions: six airgun teams, one airgun team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann advanced from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the round 2013 / 14.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has advanced from Gauliga Nord to Gauoberliga.
In addition to the sport of shooting, events such as stabbing, carnival and royal ball, club outing and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivities in the parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart ’ s return to the track ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team principal, Chad Johnston, said his 14 team members were disappointed, but are now focusing on the race in Richmond, Virginia this weekend.
"I wish we had had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We drive to Richmond and hope that we can do better there.
Stewart drove earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had the right side of his car repaired.
"I have been very hopeful about a good result today," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident Stewarts car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped out of three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash track race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart will face charges.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart had advanced to the top ten shortly thereafter and was temporarily fourth.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs
# 18 out of control after the exit from turn 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart drove on, but dropped to 21st place.
Looking for young dancers
Simply try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to welcoming fellow campaigners.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in TV Jahn have to cope with full-day lessons at secondary schools.

Ukrainian army has abandoned airport of Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, in which allegedly also Russian tank battalions were involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn personal conclusions from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top leadership of the army, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists once again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters, according to their own accounts.
According to Russian agencies, some 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region on Monday.

NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia because of the planned stationing in Eastern Europe as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.
NATO ’ s Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said in Brussels on Monday that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
But NATO ’ s chief accused Russia of “crass breach ” of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show "that they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to strengthen NATO ’ s presence in Eastern Europe.
A readiness action plan to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official figures, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price Ukraine gets no more fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger recently mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe obtains about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks powerword: Toll will come "very clearly"
Now the Chancellor is making a clear commitment to this once again.
But it is not a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent reservations from the CDU against the car tolls have increasingly angered the CSU.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken after continuing resistance from her CDU a power word for the introduction of a passenger car in tolls.
"To put it bluntly: it is in the coalition agreement and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
For the time being, however, Merkel did not commit to a detailed model.
In the black and red government program "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal and work is now under way".
However, the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia insists on its no to tolls on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
Apart from the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble left a "Spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is examining its own concept to compensate highway investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017.
Responding to this, CSU Leader Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the leading minister.
Armin Laschet, vice-president of the CDU, reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all county and federal roads would be tolled," said the Nordrhein-Westfalen CDU.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will talk about the topic again.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU in Baden Württemberg and Rhineland in Palatinate.
There are fears that tolls will affect local border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded loyalty to the coalition government because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU.
The left considers the plans to have failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks" toll is dead ", said party leader Bernd Riexinger the" Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung "(Monday).
“The minister fails with the toll. ” Dobrindt wants to introduce a toll sticker on all German roads, which is due to start in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, however, domestic car owners must not be burdened.
They are therefore to receive full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
However, according to EU law, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers on account of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived most of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot, Marie, Tooth, Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe walking and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich ’ s ataxia (FA) – a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two, now 51, said, "As a child, I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride a roller skate or skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records at the age of 13 when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair when I was 18 and die when I was 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined, and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you would be in a wheelchair now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness ’ month to raise awareness of the disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether works since the closure of the former military training area as a fireworks
For almost ten years no more fire has been fired at the former military training area in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up locally.
A deafening bang reverberates over the heart of the biosphere during the blasting.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen training area, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500 hectare area has been the centrepiece of the Swabian Alb biosphere reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
Economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local corporate tax rulings rose slightly last year, as economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The corporate state and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year after the declining motions of several years in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster than local taxes, by 4.3%, according to a study conducted by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District ’ s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland ’ s tax revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue (28 percent).
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in companies ’ property values, say researchers, resulting in a 3.7% increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.
While a large part of these profits came from big states like California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a large proportion of real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is thus forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent corporate tax revenue recovery cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Company revenues also seem to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland earned $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not increasing evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the District was 4.3 percent, the national average, while the increase in Maryland was much higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has by far the lowest corporate income taxes (6%) in all three government departments (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower government and local corporate taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, the law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, so they are paying more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen – a transitional structure that organizes most small businesses – in the District, Maryland, and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2% increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Yet the Washington area may lag behind if the federal government ’ s spending cuts affect the region ’ s labor market.
Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt ’ s twin city in China is now hoping for a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Vice Party Secretary Li Yiwei of the South Chinese metropolis during a visit of an SPD delegation to his city this week.
Again and again in the course of the conversation, the functionary of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this concern of the Twelve Million Metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
People would therefore also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
Hessian Social Democratic Party leader Thorsten Schäfer, who led the German political delegation, promised the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and zest for life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre was already emanating from Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou toasted with shepherd "Gümbel" - but with red wine, which was served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao is brewed according to the German Purity Law.

A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice party leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again", the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travelers must take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for air connections.
Vice provincial governor Chen Yunxian emphasized this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," answered Shepherd Gümbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert on Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-groomed partnership
The affable vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in that position.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor was removed from office on corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against Party and administration corruption, which is being fiercely enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functionary in Fujian, where the automobile manufacturer VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen town twinning arrangements.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9000 kilometres away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese alliance was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
She said she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros next year.
Family of Joan Rivers "keeps its fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a note today.
We all keep our fingers crossed.
According to sources, her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest in a hospital on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The response came from many sides, including an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Stricter environmental standards will apply in future to cars and vacuum cleaners that will be on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the appliance at a glance.
New cars are subject to sharper nitrogen oxide values in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: They receive a nationwide minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google ’ s video service was decided for a cool billion, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravura pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to an insider.
The Twitch ， interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which know-it-all give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is also the case that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established engineering company buying a potential competitor.
It ’ s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn ’ t materialize, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say that they prefer to play sports rather than watch, it ’ s hard to grasp the attraction of watching others play, rather than taking control of the console.
It is one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a nutcase being shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of today ’ s most popular games are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the high-speed runs in which the Roger Bannisters complete entire games in record time in our electronic age are entertaining.
But as long as there isn ’ t a virtuoso or humor player, his Twitch ’ s channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It ’ s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something any business would like: thousands of young men being courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch both "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
On the bouncing castle with the castle garden celebration was on Saturday some going on.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy rainfall on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel castle garden is to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening by various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturday, when the first visitors went to the open air.
The organisers had promised a feast for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the surrounding area had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, bobbing their feet to the beat, enjoying cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day.
And that right through the generations.
While some floated on blankets on the extra carted white sand at the beach bar, others refreshed themselves at a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But the volunteers also had their hands full in the truest sense of the word when it came to face painting for children in order to cope with the crush and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.
The older ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboarding workshop organized by the Goodfoot Team from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 o'clock it struck down on the visitors, above all families looked the width and dry.
But this did not detract from the attractiveness of the festival.
"There were more people coming than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of "success across the board."
Therefore nothing stands in the way of a repeat of the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear to the Volksstimme in a first assessment on Sunday.
He called it annoying that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously the security company had been booked with too few forces.
The consequence: Some, who had already paid, did not come to the area any longer.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimation the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors, who romped around in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound engineering.
The Salzwedel hip-and-hop band Blocks' n 'Rox broke off their performance unnerved.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a flat tyre.
"But they will be there next year," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula ’ s Open Air was more than successful.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but will have to be eliminated at the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, the organizers also have to accept criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you simply expected more", Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"Unfortunately you have taken on a little bit", says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as closely.
I think it is very good that some people not only talk stupid, but also really try to get something up and running.
Hats off! ", Stephanie Jenß writes about the Amula.
Now the organizers have one year to put an end to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg ’ s landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the prepared component waits to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the installation of the space observation radar TIRA, the envelope, the so-called radome, is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 metres, the new radome will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old shell is removed and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new hull is attached.
If the weather plays along, the action is to go at the beginning of this week over the stage.
Participant in the ice bucket challenge contorted jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully awry.
A woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much at the ice bucket challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing that, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn ’ t work, the jaw was jammed, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister also saw this and almost got into their pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was hospitalized in order to have her jaw relocated after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was an internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the castle clubs soon pull together again?
Finally there was again and again quarrel between the two Wolfratshausen castle associations.
Now the board members are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser castle friends, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
Until now, the positions on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshausen castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be vastly different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks are soon to be held on a joint approach.
This is confirmed by Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) when asked by our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could again pull together in the future.
Thus visible successes were to be registered faster.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath up to the last had a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in the eye, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and experiencing" of the area stands in the first place.
Herbert Piffl, the second chairman of the Burgfreunde, said he was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath ’ s death he has presided over the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September at a general meeting.
According to the 74 year old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we stopped the activities of the association out of respect for the time being".
According to Piffl the new chairman should then go into the discussion with the castle association.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make themselves a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will be found." He himself does not want to stand for election because he lives in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to "but very happy to continue working on the project".
The different points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already well advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
By a high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all world they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time I came more and more to the conviction that it is meaningful to advance the project. "It could be created a" unique selling point "for the rafting city.
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"Personally, I do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein might make a difference in this respect.
Their goal, to first document the story, "is important and good".
After that, one could look further.
Clever Ways to Save at the University of Textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the almost complete second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever Sparidee idea.
He invented a loan system for books from students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick ’ fil ’ A ’ biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that students spend an average of more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are various cost containment options for students.
Online-shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Rental of textbooks is becoming more popular, and students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in the college ’ s bookstores were rented last spring semester, said Neebo ’ s vice president, Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the basics for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price they are available in the campus ’ bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased at specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying Second Hand
If you don't mind the notes of others or normal traces of usage, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is available on Chegg.com for 93,49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for 48 $.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors whether earlier spending was permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rentals
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, think about returning them, and do not want to keep them after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of one semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the deal you rent from, including any penalties you may incur for writing notes, underscores or signs of use.
Attention tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty may even exceed the price of a new book.
E ’ Books
Also, e-books instead of conventional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are leased de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be attending Pepperdine Law School in the near future, recommends the ISBN as the number to determine the price of books, so you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college ’ s bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a box office hit
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone earned less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" earned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored for Cameron Diaz, only earned 14.6 million dollars on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappoint in terms of revenue.
An article by Telegraph ’ s film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children ’ s films the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "How to Train Your Dragon 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer film release that was shown between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year on at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the views of cinema-goers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to last year's.
Some commentators believe that the evolution is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web-based streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to accept that and not try to go back in time.
In contrast to the currently weak box office results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues with streaming contents amounting to 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, when revenues amounted to 837 million dollars.
Last summer director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating too much on film adaptations of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
Simon Kinberg, the creator of X-Men, recently described the drop in box office earnings as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood reporters, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office and no one will worry about the deal anymore."
When some years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted for the purpose of tightening the leagues, which was a step in the right direction.
Now, the German Table Tennis Association has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to its program.
The consequence: those who did not ascend have descended.
Göttingen ’ s highest-ranking team, the Torpedo, has thus avoided relegation in the Oberliga, but will only play in the coming season in a five-class way.
Torpedos ladies remain four-class, despite their terrific penetration into the Regionalliga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo "Reserve" compete in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttingen clubs represented.
In the women's league, TTV Geismar plays second in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo home second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district upper league south.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC will compete.
Regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende play in the Bezirksliga, in the district class of the TTC II, Rotes Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of it.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen start in the Bezirksliga.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends its girls to the small Bezirksliga.
Also the Bezirksliga "squadron" of the SCW "Jungen" - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV start the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen districts start with nine teams each.
In the West Flight are the Red White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the East-Squadron.
The women ’ s team consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
That is still better than in the circle Osterode, where there are no more ladies teams at county level.
Remarkably that none of the six 2nd circle classes reaches set strength, here the innovative and bustling circle executive committee will have to think already once.
NATO: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, around 150 people gathered in front of Cardiff City Hall to hold a counter-summit.
Mr Fairclough has followed developments over the weekend and spoken to demonstrators from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bushwalkers were brought to safety with the winch after being caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW for the night.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left shortly after Sunday noon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath for their tour.
Worried relatives called the police at about 8: 00 p.m. when the two of them did not return home.
A search party of local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found at about 23 pm near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and opened his head.
Rescue personnel stayed overnight with the couple and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition by ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The approximately 1000 demonstrators have been pushed by soldiers from the PTV buildings, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The station resumed broadcasting after a good half an hour.
PTV ’ s director Athar Farooq said the baton-armed demonstrators had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators demand the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
The police announced that around one kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, around 3,000 demonstrators had once again clashed with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital records, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when demonstrators tried to reach Sharif ’ s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting at the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without resorting to violence."
The communiqué went on to say: 'The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state'.
The escalating violence has fuelled concern about military intervention, which has already led to more coups in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have continued since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of fraudulently winning last May ’ s parliamentary election.
Qadri demands the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators initially held out peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them over the weekend to go to Sharif ’ s residence.
Hütteldorfer after second victory of the season in third place of the table.
With the 2: 0 over Grödig a bitter week on Sunday has come to a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team reached an intermediate level with the exit in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The feeling of success was incredibly important", confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, the green "White" pushed forward to third place.
With the second victory of the season, Schrammel “Traumtor ” brings Rapid on the winning road Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a sense of achievement into the international break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent lead, Volley vom Sechzehnereck.
"I thought, I'm all the frustration from Thursday puff in and clicked him under the crossbar", said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
Therefore, the first championship goal in Rapid Dress will remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid Offspring," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term cymbal, Blessur by Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience to be able to exercise this position mirror-inverted.
He deserved the goal, he has already done some assists this year, ” praised Barisic.
Team Schrammel showed character Schrammel also delivered the cross to 2: 0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could have written to us.
"Thank God we were a bit lucky today," remarked Schrammel, referring to the gap between performance and results in recent weeks: "The results were not right, but the playfulness was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that they had been "better in many games before than they are today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-point finish since 26 July therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that it has character".
No less pleasing for him: "That we finally played to zero again".
Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger had to complain about several losses and that Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their debuts makes the victory even more valuable.
"This must not be forgotten", warned Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
The international break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and improve the physical condition a little", said Barisic, who has five U21 players in his ranks.
One person, who would like to take a break, is Captain Hofmann.
He tears himself apart for the crew, goes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he showed that he is a very important player for us, "stated Barisic.
Before his substitution in the 68th minute, Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga team game, it was the first goal out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now." "We certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He admittedly admonished to concentrated further work: "One may not see it always black and white.
In recent weeks, we have not played so badly as has been described.
However, we must not believe that all is well now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They hold on to me in certain phases, "said Hofmann.
Coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter hit "from the category magic goal", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly deprived by referee collegue.
The only reproach I can make to the team is that in some phases we were not concrete enough towards goal.
Since we have had too few degrees.
Central defender Maximilian Karner had a similar view: "It started badly, but then we found a way and even scored a goal.
By and large, more would have been possible.
There's peace under this treetop
We showed a mighty tribe in our puzzle of the summer series "My Piece of Rhoen Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these giant trees still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600 year old oak.
We pass paddocks, piles of basalt and seas of basalt.
A piece below the quarry of the Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
The natural monument looks vital, it towers above the other trees in the area and, with a circumference of over eight metres, resembles an American sequoia.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only hints at the origin of the name.
Dr Wolfgang Schneider specifically consulted the Bischofsheim archive and questioned elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to find out what the connection was with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds drove their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the meadows that had been painstakingly cleared and freed of stones.
At the foot of the tree the animal keepers exhausted by the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows goat herds are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further discovered.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, one should be careful, because the basalt warmed by the sun is also a popular residence for vipers.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, which ascend towards Hochrhön and invite to an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
A moated castle, which is looked for with our next task, is to be found however rather rarely in the height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building image could fit.

Last week, after weeks of tug-of-war, Italy ’ s prime minister and current EU president, Matteo Renzi, pushed through the nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of EU foreign policy in the face of strong conservative opposition at the EU ’ s special summit.
Renzi, according to the pro-government daily La Repubblica, considers the appointment of his favourite Mogherini, also in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
It also expects a boost to its "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base that repeatedly revolts against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it - even if rather in a moderate way.
According to the prevailing opinion in Rome, a political balance will be struck with the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as Council President Donald Tusk.
The EU ’ s chief diplomat will at the same time be the deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41 year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, who has been in office for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will rise to the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
The political scientist began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left democrats), which merged with the Catholic center party Margherita to form today's social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became vice-president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the party council of the left democrats, she entered the high party politics, worked in the department of foreign policy, which she soon became head.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies of NATO ’ s deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
She has been a Member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The PD counters the allegations in Brussels that the new EU representative for external relations has too little diplomatic experience and thus lacks substance.
In Brussels, above all by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are pursued and defamed as a "pro-Russia course".
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow on her first state visit.
Photos showing them with Putin at the Shake ’ hands were taken in outrage in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people began their training with emz ’ Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.

The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order," said François Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle met with disapproval from the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question France ’ s controversial 35-hour week, despite strong calls for a relaxation of the rule by Emmanuel Macron, the new Economics Minister.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his co-socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, threw a spanner in the works by appearing at a meeting of renegade Socialist deputies and criticising the Socialist Party for taking away the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the Socialists ’ ongoing trench warfare, saying that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament and said she was confident of winning early elections and was ready for the government.
France ’ s ruling party was defeated in the March local elections, and the right-wing National Front came out on top in the May EU elections.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande ’ s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
“There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing, ” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise on the verge of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world ’ s third largest cruise company, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for around $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also come to an inconclusive end.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to be able to remain anonymous, since the negotiations were not open to the public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and is expected to grow over the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed an IPO with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise in its current form was created in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
According to regulatory authorities, at the end of June Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have jointly the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises over 82 Percent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A group loyal to Beijing waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People ’ s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates for Hong Kong ’ s 2017 leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain majority support from a nominating committee likely to be composed of Beijing-loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to carry out their threat and paralyze Hong Kong ’ s financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong, and China ’ s leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China ’ s domination of Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city ’ s business district and organizing a sit in.
Li ’ s survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee Legal Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao State Council Affairs, Feng Wei, were to be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Britain did not envisage any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist area of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine would have to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin ’ s call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits in with the strategy he appears to have pursued since the riots began five months ago: helping the separatists take over territory and putting pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held areas in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the captured territory "Novorossiya" or "Novorussia," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of Ukrainian politicians' campaigns for the elections on 26 October and while government groups attack civilian communities in areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks, are "trapped in their illusions," Itar Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin ’ s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman ’ s clarification to correct the “misinterpretation ” of Putin ’ s remarks underscored Russia ’ s claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and pre-conflict polls showed a broad majority in favor of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats in international fora would empower Ukraine ’ s regional governments to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thereby giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russia ’ s territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port of most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that, after fresh elections, Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the constitution that would give the respective areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems sharply opposed to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, who are accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin ’ s latest call for Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with the separatist leaders followed a further advance by the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk in a coup, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
As a result, massive civil and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and the narrow entrance to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council (NSC).
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal involving Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who supposedly stole nude images of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who ’ s who of the Hollywood celebrities.
The film city is in a state of agitation after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal involving celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this has probably over 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tributes of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also reported to have published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
101 celebrities are on the list.
The noblest, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly said on a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that those affected felt "hurt."
The hacker presumably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her former friend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying topless in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck, Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence 'told TMZ: "It is an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a phone is nothing other than selling stolen goods."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Yesterday cyclists, joggers and hikers took part in the 8th edition of cycling on the Großer Feldberg and supported the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Help for children with cancer).
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, was an easy training for others.
But everyone agreed on one thing: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery went up the Feldberg by bike yesterday.
For a good cause.
The small muscle soreness he can put away easily there, particularly since the participation in 8. Cycling on the large field mountain for the benefit of the association “assistance for cancer-ill children ” (Frankfurt) brought to him also personally a valuable realization.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - great!"
Small break on the way in the Applauskurve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants were tortured yesterday in the early dew and arrived on the plateau near exhaustion, but happily.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11-kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The completely in red appearing Green politician from the circle day - red Dress, red Bike - made at the start still something on understatement ("Any quantity professionals, there arriving is the goal!"), turned out then however on the mountain nevertheless as half a professional and went after 45 minutes without shortness of breath by the finish.
Like Nina Kuhn, press officer of the town of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen, he also crossed the track in one go.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we like to participate - we would have made a ride today anyway", said Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning in order to pedal back to the height.
Florian Zierz from Frankfurt had swung into the saddle at home at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, only to roll home with fun.
Fun was also "Fries and Toni".
For the head of the cult kiosk in Oberursel, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of the package.
He had aimed with his 6.5 kilos of road bike 40 Minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there ", said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained man from Mainz says that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
It has to be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Bike", which are also racing bikes, but without gearshift...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed up the White Wall and the Fox Dance to the summit proved that it was easy to climb up without a wheel, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Mountain Rescue Team Physician Professor Volker Lischke, who provided security with his team, equipped with four-wheel Bully and Quad, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled track, only that he pulls the sled himself." So the man is in a way his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - had been sent on the course in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that he will be able to close the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
