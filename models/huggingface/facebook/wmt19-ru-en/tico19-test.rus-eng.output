The rapidly rising cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, despite its different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units need to be better prepared for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will require treatment, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the pathogen was a new type of coronavirus, now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to currently available data, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe form of illness requiring hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% it becomes critical when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) country and the United Kingdom, and compares them with trends in China's Hubei Province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and the UK with data for Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and the rest of the world is now experiencing a COVID-19 pandemic at the same pace as China's.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of the journal Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the WHO's criteria for determining the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU / EEA were reported in France on January 24, 2020 - all three returning from Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 infections had been detected in all 30 EU / EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between December 31, 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, were in Italy alone.
Determining the cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8: 00 a.m. the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as ministries of health in those countries, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO.
These data are used to analyze trends in the spread of COVID-19 across the EU / EEA and the UK, and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days was calculated, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as of 8: 00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK
Trends in truncated cumulative COVID-19 morbidity over a 14-day period in the EU / EEA countries and in the UK were broadly in line with those observed in Hubei Province of China (Fig. 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around February 21, and on February 28, 2020, there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy for the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8: 00 am on March 15 in the 15 other EU / EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK.
Observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in different countries, the different responses of national public health authorities, and possibly the different criteria for recognizing cases, and the different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already fully occupied.
Currently, admission data for patients with COVID-19 in hospitals and / or intensive care units in the EU / EEA are available for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (no data provided).
However, such data need to be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data on the number of reported cases and deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment Report on COVID-19 presents scenarios for health system resource utilization, with estimates of hospitalization of infected COVID-19 patients in each EU / EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available intensive care beds exceeds 90%.
As the cases are currently grouped into certain EU / EEA and UK regions, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, it is recommended that information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, if possible, to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units Level 2 units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units must therefore be prepared for a long-term SARS-CoV-2 exposure scenario and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the ECDC's recent Rapid Risk Assessment report, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to containing the spread of SARS-COV-2, followed by a shift from containment to mitigation, because, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to reflect, adopt, and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and ease the strain on their health systems.
If not, health-care systems in other EU / EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity, with more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 infections in China and around the world to date.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about a new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of a rapidly evolving research subject.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which in 2020 fell on January 25, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards in the wake of the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the virus SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the concomitant disease coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been identified, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), more than 200 publications about COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, have appeared in less than two months, starting with the first report on January 7, 2020, which sequenced the virus from a range of patients.
This review is an attempt to synthesize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts currently known about prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common respiratory diseases.
Yet, twice this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak initially in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with appalling levels of disease severity and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known that health workers had been infected, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus.
On January 23, a quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan, and public transport in the city was stopped.
On January 24, according to the first clinical trial of the disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to some 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid evolution of the situation, the final scale and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic was presented (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA) following a multi-center clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19.
All age groups were affected by SARS-CoV-2, but the majority were between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were older than 50, very few were younger than 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31 / 100,000) than among women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed in clusters mainly in Hubei Province and surrounding regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days elapsed between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
An average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days elapsed from the onset of symptoms to death.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infections, coinciding with the massive traffic on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and adjusted mortality among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were sex (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses that contain a single strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein in the coronaviruses (S) binds to cell receptors of the angiotensin-transforming enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, and membrane synthesis occurs.
In cytoplasm, the viral RNA genome is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with membrane glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane to release the virus.
The first reports on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome matches 99.98% of the 10 sequential samples collected at the first outbreak site at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using translucent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin slices of the human respiratory epithelium.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than SARS-CoV, which explains why SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 contains no known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors, led by Zhou, presented reports on the cryo-electron tomography of the structure of the full-size human enzyme ACE2 with a 2.9 ˚ resolution in conjunction with the amino acid conveyor B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, providing evidence for the recognition of a coronavirus and its infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and the Intermediate Master
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats, from which the virus is transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was established that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, as the new virus is 96% identical to two coronaviruses similar to SARS, namely, bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host that enabled the virus to cross the species barrier and infect humans; the mode of transmission has also yet to be determined.
Mr Ji and his colleagues hypothesized that snakes were the carriers of the virus from bats to humans, resulting in a homological recombination in the S-protein.
In their study, Chinese scientists in Guangzhou suggested that pangolins - long-necked mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on 99% genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that definitive results with concrete evidence are not yet available (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat to 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorocontaining disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively block the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so humans are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4) .4).
Typically, the host virus is first recognized by the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (ORPs), including lectin C-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response becomes involved in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4 + T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, while CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help defense cells.
However, a coronavirus can inhibit T cell function, causing programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system leads to the local production of large amounts of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
People who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or have compromised immune systems are more likely to become infected.
Based on data from the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.
The later study described above, based on 8,866 demographics, showed an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for public health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to account for the most accurate estimates of the incubation period, thereby preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with asymptomatic disease.
A 14-day quarantine for people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus has become a common practice.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The first and foremost symptom of COVID-19 is often a high fever, which may be the only symptom or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as a dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and / or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and / or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even if there are no abnormalities in the chest images.
A population study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence of symptoms: 98% high fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results have been obtained in two recent studies of domestic transmission and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected individuals.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which is much higher than in patients with COVID-19 and corresponds to a higher proportion of deaths from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throats (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required by 14-20% of patients.
As of February 14, deaths from COVID-19 stood at 2%, bringing the total number of confirmed cases worldwide to 66,576.
By comparison, SARS deaths by November 2002 accounted for 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
In an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2-4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures show a higher transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower mortality rate when infected with a new virus compared to the latter two.
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will thus be much more difficult to contain than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
A cluster manifestation often occurs when an infection occurs within the same family or group of people who have come together for some reason or who are caught together on some form of transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or came into contact with infected or sick people in the last two weeks before the outbreak.
However, the reports suggest that people can carry the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and that patients who are cured after leaving hospital may relapse into the virus, raising the alarm for an extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced amounts of white cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymphopenia with white cell levels < 4 × 109 / L, including white cell levels < 1 × 109 / L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin-aminotransferase and virosemia.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition.
In patients with severe disease, levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, were increased and the number of lymphocytes steadily decreased.
In most patients with COVID-19, chest X-rays revealed pathologies characterized by irregular darkening on both sides or "matt glass "-like blackouts in the lungs.
Patients often develop SARS, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ARI).
In the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis lead to significant disruption of gas exchange.
Pneumocyte dysfunction of Types I and II lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the detachment of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, and intertissue lymphocytic infiltration, while the multicuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathologies of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The primary criterion used in diagnosing COVID-19 was the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTCR).
However, given the high level of false-negative results that can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, starting on February 13, 2020, China began to make diagnoses based on clinical evidence (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).
The same was true of SARS diagnostics.
Thus, a combination of medical records, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and X-ray results is critical and necessary for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, a team led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK method, based on a repetition of CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at densities ranging from 20 × 10-18 mol / l to 200 × 10-18 mol / l (10-100 copies per microliter of the original sample) in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, could significantly improve the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Owing to a lack of experience in dealing with a previously unknown coronavirus, physicians can generally provide patients with COVID-19 with only supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapies that have been used or proposed for other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2) .2).
These therapies include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, steroids, recovered patients "plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.
Drug companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, but also, perhaps to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Respiratory support, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen levels, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, which are prescribed according to the severity of the disease, is thus critical to relieve symptoms and save lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
Maintaining the water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an overreaction of the immune systems of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immunocytes to release huge amounts of free radicals, which become the main cause of ARI and multiorgan failure.
In treating cytokine storms, especially in patients in serious condition, suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that act as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive cytokine storm treatments include modulation of immune responses to control T cells; blocking the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; blinatumab, cytokine suppressors 4, and histondeaacetalase inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immune suppressants to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses.
However, high-dose steroids are not helpful in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at low and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, the intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdechivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, Remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this compound to China to conduct paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir / ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapeutic options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined lopinavir / ritonavir treatment can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients.
Recovered patients "plasma and antibody production
Blood collection from patients cured of a contagious disease, to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has long been used.
Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are found in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which were then injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to propose the widespread use of this method prior to specific therapy, untested tests and explanations are needed.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma use should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is potentially life-threatening.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low, and plasma is needed to treat critically ill patients.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate B-cells from recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies, or to screen for effective antibodies against critical proteins in the virus.
In this way, we can immediately move to mass production of antibodies.
For millennia, the Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of many components of a formula whose composition differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, because it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.
Today, in the absence of effective COVID-19-specific therapies, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms, or for patients recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 patients were found in a number of provinces in China where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, recorded the lowest recovery rate (13%).
But this is a crude comparison, because the assessment must take into account many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment based exclusively on Western medicine and combination treatments based on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that patients treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine had significantly less time to normalize their body temperature, resolve symptoms, and receive in-patient care than patients treated with Western-only treatments.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients whose symptoms began to deteriorate (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated with Western alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely monitored research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine, or a combination of them.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 generally experience a strong fear of an acute, contagious or even deadly disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.
Moreover, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing, as well as side effects of treatment such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, part of public health efforts to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine, and social stigma to their families and friends.
Psychological and psychiatric care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, those under suspicion and those in contact with them, and all other people who need it.
Psychological support should include multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to susceptible hosts, and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy, which is used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to develop vaccines based on S-protein, which aim to develop long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and / or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live weakened vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed in animal studies.
However, before clinical trials can begin, the efficacy of these potential vaccines in vivo in age patients, the pattern of lethal dose infection, and the degree of protection against zoonotic virus infection must still be determined.
Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions through the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein elements have been developed to combat MERS, and some have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task that must be addressed if the epidemic is to be contained.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long lead time (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variation of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only just beginning to show a full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients make a gradual recovery without complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on current clinical trial data, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of disease caused by SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over the age of 50, according to the aforementioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not (66 years on average compared to 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to develop acute myocardial lesions and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver damage in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort the results.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein levels in the blood reflect the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and are suggested as a potential predictor of disease progression, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity, and COVID-19 prognosis should be taken into account.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagin-aminotransferase, alanin-aminotransferase, and creatinkinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be considered, among other factors, to predict COVID-19 outcomes and complications.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressants commonly used in infectious diseases as complementary therapies to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, resulting in lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroid use is necessary to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in low doses and in short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty, and witness the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to relieve the stress of such patients and help them rebuild their lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who are in the early stages of the disease or have not yet completed their incubation period may, in the course of their normal lives, be able to spread the virus on a large scale, making epidemiological surveillance much more difficult.
However, transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was thought to occur when patients were gravely ill, whereas in most cases there was no early infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic and more difficult to control.
China is currently working hard to establish a universal quarantine regime in Wuhan and neighboring cities, and to extend the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population to break the chain of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures are causing enormous damage to the country's economy and other areas of life, the number of new cases being detected is declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
On the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the extinction phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr Paul Hunter and colleagues have calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from a team led by Ira Longini have created a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in swabs from the nose and throat of patients who recovered and were released from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a flu-like cyclical disease.
But the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have had an impact.
According to initial projections, Ebola was expected to infect up to a million people and kill half a million patients.
But, thanks to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 virus's ability to infect may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, meaning that oral-faecal transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection at the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified illnesses and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues, and even bystanders who come into contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent micro-droplets of fluid from potentially infected people from flying in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 class masks (1860s series) can protect against inhalation of virions of size 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care workers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care workers should wear a figure-fitting protective robe to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 class mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective goggles.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectant detergents, to try to stay indoors in self-isolation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was not previously known to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, given its experience during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until after January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagious and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person, and that preventing the spread and controlling the disease would not be a problem.
The announcement significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could have been contained within Wuhan with minimal casualties.
China's health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as every word counts and can influence attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger action to contain a potential epidemic early on rather than reassuring the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly test and improve public response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unstudied severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 outbreak gave rise to a recurrence of SARS.
There are, however, some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and death rates among older people is also higher than among young people.
Mortality from SARS is higher than in COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is asymptomatic, whereas patients with SARS typically infect others only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may test negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, treated patients may test positive for the virus again.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Given this rapid advance in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96% homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated from bats.
Which animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from its original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt transmission, and epidemiological conditions can escalate at any moment.
Molecular modeling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus infiltrate respiratory cells and trigger subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, disappear as much as SARS, or relapse periodically like influenza?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
The Zoonotic Origin of Human Coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause a mild illness, such as a common cold.
Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China at the end of 2019 brought renewed attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with its high transmittance, but weaker pathogenicity than the sister virus SARS-CoV.
A human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origins would be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs carrying some human coronaviruses are also known.
Defining animal carriers has a direct impact on preventing the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals that carry coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and modes of interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
The current epidemic of the coronavirus, discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), is seen in this context.
In addition, the conditions necessary for successful transmission change and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest genome of RNA-containing viruses, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which when viewed under an electron microscope resembles a crown.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain non-segmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyprotein replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are then processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1 ~ 16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including thoracic protein (S), membrane protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines also encode a number of lineages of specific accessory proteins.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta-coronaviruses), with the beta-coronavirus species including most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta-coronaviruses.
For millennia, coronaviruses have continuously overcome interspecies barriers, and some have evolved to become pathogens dangerous to humans.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include the human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as a cold and / or diarrhea.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a comparatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of patients with a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), there was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in recent history, with more than 8,000 cases and an overall mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
Revealed in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, had claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been raised, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are zoonotic, originating from bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms viruses are well adapted and do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but show wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge.
Research into the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will provide insight into their natural history, the drivers of their evolution, and the constraints on interspecies transport.
It may also prompt or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is essential to prevent the disease from re-spreading in the future.
This review provides an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and address the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originate are not usually pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is seen in the same context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first derived from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of cold patients, various coronaviruses were found in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 presents a brief chronological history of the discovery of human coronaviruses in an informative and illustrative manner.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was derived from respiratory samples taken from patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; the virus subsequently adapted to reproduce in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise, and sore throats, with fever and coughing occurring in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of sucker mice.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those of HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are ubiquitous around the world and are generally transmitted in winter at temperate latitudes.
The main incubation period for the two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients developed severe lower respiratory tract infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the SARS epidemic, was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the disease was caused by SARS-CoV, the third identified human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread across many countries and continents.
Excluding overactive transmitters, it was estimated that each case could infect about two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak of viral load was on day 10.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially developed muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise, and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, coughing, and respiratory failure.
Common laboratory abnormalities in SARS include lymphopenia, abnormalities in liver samples, and elevated levels of creatinkinase.
SARS patients also experience diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased macrophage levels.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open biopsy of the lungs of a relative of a patient who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found to mainly affect young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
Diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 include runny nose, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the extraction of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is ubiquitous.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause about 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, with peak cases occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 has been associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as cranberry.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong that year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to hospital-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been linked to an increase in asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, has been identified worldwide.
All four of the human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation into highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Normally, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic by acquiring the ability to transmit and survive effectively in the human body.
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but several European countries and Tunisia have recorded imported cases and spread through sporadic secondary exposure through close contact.
Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
Between mid-December and the end of December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now, with hindsight, associated with an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a global public health emergency, with the disease dubbed "Coronavirus Infection 19" (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there were 9,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in China's Hubei province is 4.2%, and outside the province it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes severe respiratory infection, characterized by fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nonetheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has greater transmission capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, indicating the virus's ability to spread rapidly around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen in human coronaviruses, which cause non-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, there are also interesting patterns in SARS-CoV-2 transmission that are common to both human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as in human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent passage of the virus (that is, infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause hospital-acquired infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in feces samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmittance, pathogenicity, and sustained spread through humans.
All four human coronaviruses, which cause hospital-acquired infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it is possible that humans adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of past human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses, which cause severe illness in humans, and human coronaviruses, which cause severe illness in humans, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate sufficiently in the human body to produce an accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract carrier limitation factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, human transmission will be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing a common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to conserve and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek out susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four non-hospital HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as non-hospital HCoV, at least for the time being.
But it is more pathogenic than non-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and circulates in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it transmits a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Likewise, the carrier tank continuously transports HCoV over a long period of time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate medium just before or about the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new medium and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as a reinforcing carrier, allowing the virus to replicate rapidly and then transmit it to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can carry a dead-end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside an intermediate medium.
By contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to intermediate carriers and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate medium becomes the natural reservoir medium.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with game.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV is higher in animal traders than in the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoons in live animal markets were the first confirmed carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all quotations in the markets, no more cases of SARS were reported.
At the same time, it was reported that Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms that were not marketed did not have SARS-CoV in most cases, suggesting that Himalayan civets could only serve as intermediate amplifiers rather than as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Remarkably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that numerous small mammal species may also serve as intermediate amplifiers cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural animal carrier of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV called SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, which is associated with SARS in horseshoe bats and is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% the same homologation of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, except for one that stands for WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from a bat fecal sample, has been shown to use ACE2 in bats, citrus, and humans as a receptor to enter a cell.
Interestingly, serums from recovering patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest related SARS-CoV ancestor in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homologity between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 of bats and CoV-HKU5 of bats.
CoV-HKU4 in bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to sequences from bat beta-coronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homologues of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats coincide by only 87%.
That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-hump camels are seropositive to MERS-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Living MERS-CoV, identical to a virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of single-humped camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had mild symptoms but massive virus outbreaks.
It is noteworthy that infected camels excreted the virus not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for excreting the virus in bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have no history of contact with camels before symptoms develop and are plausibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or transmission by unknown channels including unidentified animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
The homology of the nucleotides SARS-CoV-2 matches 96.2% of the CoV RaTG13 bats isolated in Asian horseshoes Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to them parental relationships.
That is, bats might not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical bat coronaviruses were found in the future.
Presumably, the immediate carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed at the Wuhan Wholesale Seafood Market, which has been linked to many of the initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a probable case of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent metagenomic sequencing studies have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent beta-coronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The nucleotide sequence homology of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85-92% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with nucleotide-sequence identities accounting for about 90%.
They are clustered into two sublines of differentiation of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
By contrast, the RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite the higher degree of homologation of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangolins also reported the identification of viral contigues in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
The possibility that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been established.
Whereas the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest homology of sequences within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between beta-coronaviruses of pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates a recombination between the beta-coronavirus pangolin, a sister of SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As an evolutionary driver, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no definitive decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 are also being studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can originate from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in a North American tricolor sucker, was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, which was found in Ghana, although it was suspected that camels could also be the intermediate carrier.
For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origins of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Philogenetic analysis provided evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the history.
When interspecies transmission of HCoV-OC43 occurred around 1890 and humans became infected by domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-coronaviruses, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been found.
Between them lies alpha-coronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could come into contact with bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, humans are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-coronaviruses, related to HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-coronavirus alpaca caused a respiratory attack in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coronavirus alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas received an alpha-coronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Not surprisingly, bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-coronaviruses could serve as gene pools for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-humped camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as MERS-CoV did.
MERS-CoV provides an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-humped camels and from single-humped camels to humans.
The evolutionary origins of the MERS-CoV virus from bats are known from its initial identification and have been confirmed by subsequent studies.
Clearly, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats the "ideal distributors."
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was introduced to single-humped camels decades ago.
It adapted well to these camels, which went from intermediate carrier to stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild illness and has a relatively low mutation rate.
Its occasional transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain a dead-end MERS-CoV carrier because their transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead-end carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as citrus in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies should confirm or rule out several possibilities for interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats can be reservoirs for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats by mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifiers into which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.
Humans contract the virus through carcass cutting and eating wild meat.
It is possible that many animals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as indicated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal carriers, three major factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to cross-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high," with an average replacement rate of about 10-4 substitutions per year at one site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdeshivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdeshivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the frequency of mutations in coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than in their carriers.
Moreover, the rate of mutation can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to high-mutation SARS-CoV, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, the virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-humped camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs will quickly become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under the right conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the 3 '-end direction of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier that serves as the mixing vessel, strands are often switched.
Highly homogeneous full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 in bats.
Vector-Virus Interaction in Relation to Transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
In this paper, the recombination of SARS-CoV is cited as a typical example that also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and citrus SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapidly adaptable in different carriers, especially mutations on the SDD protein S.
In general, the RSD of the S coronavirus protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier antibody response intensively selects it.
SARS-CoV is an amino acid, 318-510, on a fragment of S1 that binds to human angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its coreceptors, to introduce the virus into a cell.
SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing APF2 receptors in different animals, including bats, citycats, mice, and raccoons, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues, which are different from human and civets viral strains, have been found in the CDR, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV citrate has mutations of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which may enhance the affinity of the thorn protein's interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important in adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S means that the binding affinity of protein S to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than that between a person's APF2 and the protein S of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of the protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from host animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of carrier dependence and limitation.
Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, single-humped camels, and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Successful interspecies transmission of HCoV viruses requires the usurpation of dependency factors and the subordination of carrier restriction factors.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-carrier interaction have yet to be defined and categorized.
Impartial, genomic screening of carrier dependency and carrier restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology can yield good results.
The Emergence of New HCoV: Back to Zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
Moreover, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, the 29-nucleotide division characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.
This division splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates medium change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations were also identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to be recombinant events between different lines, as occurred in single-humped camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoV, in which HCoV is recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of freeing the virus from the pressure of selection, for example, from the host's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to dual nucleotide deletion.
While an intact open ORF4 reading frame can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-coronavirus exhibits a single-nucleotide insert that shifts the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
Coronaviruses infected bats showed little or no symptoms, indicating that coronaviruses and bats were adapting to each other.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the apregulation of the NKG2 / CD94 inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells and the low level of expression of molecules of the main class I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high levels of active oxygen provided by the high metabolic activity of bats can inhibit the replication of the coronavirus, while affecting exoribonuclease readings, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when they enter a new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for host adaptation.
So it is no accident that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They confidently replicate without triggering a strong immune response in the host.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
By contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response does not involve replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of untying the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
In bats, the interferon response is particularly strong.
Thus, taking interferon type I, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma is impaired in bats.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same pattern that led to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a bat beta-coronavirus has been found whose nucleotide homology is 95% SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus whose nucleotide homology is 96% SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in the markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Beta-coronaviruses of pangolin were found to be strikingly homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may have served as intermediate carriers or that fragments of the genes of beta-coronaviruses of pangolins may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have gained global attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoirs in human transmission.
Strong evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection results from human-to-human contact in markets, closing and eradicating wild game markets could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of beta-coronavirus pangolins, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection.
But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-humped camels.
These camels are an important means of transport, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as China's wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge that cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic coronaviruses circulate around the world.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and / or more deadly to humans.
To reduce unnecessary human-animal contact, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After the harsh trials of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be conquered.
Although many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized.
A better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires ongoing epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission of coronaviruses and future disease outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from ecological niches in the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Some pieces are still missing from the zoonotic origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is a true intermediate carrier, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, because many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which outlines our lessons learned and provides validated recommendations for dealing with the pandemic worldwide.
But coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually enhanced based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," according to the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines (Version 7) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
The new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially known as 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, and the virus itself was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a short reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually enhanced on the basis of current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for COVID-19," published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /), were published, with some of its contents changing significantly.
A recent paper by Zhou and his co-authors commented on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new empirical evidence to our recommendations, as well as providing valuable background information on this worldwide pandemic.
We reaffirm the high value of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for COVID-19 (trial version 7) and current research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (March 3, 2020), for a comprehensive analysis to be carried out when a case of suspected disease is confirmed, it is necessary to combine one of the characteristics of an epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or stay history in and around Wuhan or other localities where COVID-19 cases were reported for 14 days before symptoms occurred; (2) contact history with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid tests); (3) contact history with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or other localities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) contact history with groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with high fever or respiratory symptoms reported for 2 weeks in small areas such as a house or apartment, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white cell count is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptoms.
A diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to new coronaviruses; (3) a positive serotest result for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, or a titer increase of at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It may also be noted that a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of this document.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in Issues 4 (January 27, 2020) and 5 (February 8, 2020); and then in Issue 7, the need for serological proof was added.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find the optimal kit for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, and for analyzing respiratory samples, including blood samples, which increases the availability of various samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criteria.
At the same time, there is growing evidence of the need for caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without severe symptoms.
Thus, the roadmap presented in Zhou et al., should be updated, because it classifies people without clinical symptoms as a "low-risk" group.
The evaluation system also needs to be refined for further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to comment.
In terms of diagnosing "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we encourage readers to keep track of and strictly follow the latest advice given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19 - day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said the reported cases included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official told the local Anadolu news agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Maitri clinic.
In an online video statement Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport has been suspended since 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods - medicines, fuel, and foodstuffs - was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth threshold of infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 people have died from the coronavirus COVID-19.
The milestone came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and the first death from the coronavirus was reported in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries not to have recorded cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the twenty-four hours prior to 10: 00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, of which at least 5,900 have been fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that there were more than 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stronger measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of the city's citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians across the country, despite their self-isolation, will receive their salaries until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state's home confinement has been extended by order until May 1.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packets of toilet paper you can buy in one go
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles have reduced the number of packets of toilet paper that can be purchased at any one time across the country to two and one packs, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack restriction.
The restrictions were announced in announcements at the box office and on the network's Facebook page.
Citizens reportedly began stockpiling emergency supplies out of fear that COVID-19 might lead to a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths chain also limited the amount of toilet paper it buys to one pack.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited that amount to 4 packs.
Retailer Coles said in a press release on March 8 that with the four-pack restriction, "many stores still sell toilet paper too quickly - one delivery in an hour" and called such demand "unprecedented," while ALDI called the trend "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
A Woolworths spokesman said there had been a sharp rise in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited the amount to two packs.
To make up for the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increasing the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered more batches, while ALDI stocked up on special early-sale promotions on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish stocks, but this was being hampered by local government restrictions on truck timetables.
He expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but fewer and fewer profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores were unable to hold promotions on Wednesday because of depleted stocks.
Speaking to News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish supplies every night.
He noted that toilet paper is bulky, so stock levels are low, and long rows of shelves remain empty after all the goods have been sold, exacerbating the sense of stock shortages.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and products like rolls of toilet paper and hand sanitizers could be placed on those shelves in large quantities, shoppers probably wouldn't panic so much," Russell Zimmerman said.
Last Wednesday, recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap reported running out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also makes Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to ensure sufficient supplies were in place.
Domain.com, the property website, said when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to a lack of buyers in Labor Day week, some property sellers began offering first-time auctioneers free toilet paper.
Thursday's edition of Darwin-based daily NT News included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to an ABC Australia report on March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose limits on the number of items they could buy, saying they had no plans to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, haberdashery, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, online retailer Ocado was also seen on Sunday night restricting the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the magnitude of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, the WHO notes that national governments need to take action:
"Together, all countries are still in a position to influence the course of the pandemic."
This is possible if countries work to identify, test, treat, isolate cases, track cases, and mobilize their citizens, "explained WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adanom Guebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said in an interview aired on CNN in February that "no respiratory virus other than influenza has ever been tracked from its inception to its continued global spread."
Mr. Gebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled. "
First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then reclassified it as a pandemic.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: "It's just the beginning, it's going to get worse."
As of Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide, and more than 4,600 people had died, according to the Associated Press.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in an estimated 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China's mortality rate is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people apart, and identifying and isolating people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk management, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread commodity shortages, exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4% of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, and there have been instances of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people who resemble them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there is significant spread of the virus.
Reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that closely resembles bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.
Two-thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified article in the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case of infection occurred on November 17, 2019, with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had declined, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, and that the number of new infections outside China had for the first time surpassed the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases may be significantly underestimated, in part because of the large number of cases with mild symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimates that 60% of the UK population will be infected before effective group immunity is established in the population.
The statistics include cases of people who were tested for COVID-19 and tested positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, have adopted official policies not to test for only mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected by January 23, and that such unreported patients were the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy far exceeded the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests the figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover safely.
In other, more complex cases, the time between onset of symptoms and death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of those who died had co-morbidity, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death data from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths of patients who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because official figures may not take into account untested deaths - for example, deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID figures by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits, "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual number." His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the US. Such under-reported cases are common in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic, with the first confirmed death recorded in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first deaths outside mainland China were reported in the Philippines on February 1, and outside Asia in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths.
The mortality / morbidity ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204).
The data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio has fallen from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of certain populations from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
The Centre for Evidence-based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the death rate from the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper number of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the flash is uncertain and can vary from location to location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University argues that "uncontrollable infectious outbreaks tend to reach a plateau, and then, when the number of available carriers runs out, they begin to fade.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen. "
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argues that "everything could be over by June," if all countries can mobilize and implement the WHO's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate perhaps within a year or two."
According to a study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is developed (perhaps 18 months or more)," physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear completely, because it's so easily transmitted," and that it "can become a seasonal disease, erupting every year."
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum in the airways (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immediate symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or feeling depressed, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and blue face or lips.
In some infected people, the disease may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that those in close contact with confirmed patients be closely monitored and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44% of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.
Some details about how the disease spread are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted through close contact, but also through small droplets released into the air through coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact refers to contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, open coughing droplets can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets thrown into the air during a conversation, which can remain airborne for longer. Respiratory droplets can also form during exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually airborne.
The droplets can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus could be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
China's government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although it can spread both before symptoms appear and later in the disease.
There have been cases where tests have been positive three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted before symptoms manifest.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
Officials at the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) say it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can live for up to three days on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304), one day on a cardboard surface, and up to four hours on a copper surface.
These data, however, vary with humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing your hands after coming into contact with animals, just as they do after coming into contact with other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur naturally in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with household soap that dissolves its protective sheath. SARS-CoV-2 bears a strong resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B), together with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus specimens (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolins and humans.
A holistic genomic comparison to date has shown that the greatest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though this should ultimately be confirmed by a polymerase reverse transcription chain reaction (PT-PCR) test of the infected secret or a CT scan.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line testing method in diagnosing COVID-19."
The WHO has published several protocols for testing RNA for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is being conducted.
It can be carried out on respiratory and blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to a few days.
Normally, a nasopharyngeal smear is used for the test, although a yawn smear can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that can detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them was accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of symptom visualization on X-rays and CT scans include asymmetrical peripheral cloudiness like matt glass and the absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases.
Because of its similarity to other infections, such as adenovirus, COVID-19 identifies images that are not confirmed by PCR tests with limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study comparing the results of chest CT and PCR testing found that, while the images are less specific to infection, they can be deciphered more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and thus can be considered as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
To diagnose the virus using X-rays and CT scans, convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using wipes when coughing or sneezing that should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have already contracted the virus should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
To prevent transmission of the disease, it is also advisable to physically distance oneself from people. Many governments advise against all non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak, and restrict the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus was able to spread to most regions of the world.
Tracking contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
Governments "use of citizens" location data using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International and more than 100 others have issued statements calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on solutions to ensure the privacy of personal data - for example, recording a user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person who tests positive for COVID-19, they will be notified.
At the moment, there is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop it.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC also recommends washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are heavily soiled, and before eating, after soaking, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which uncovers its protective lining.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a range of solutions (the disinfectant begins to work on a stainless steel surface one minute after application) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidon-iodine.
Other ingredients, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care center, all areas of such a facility, including offices, toilets, public areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discarding used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as using a mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that disperse in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of a medical mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, and touching the face with dirty hands is the main method of infection."
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as caregivers of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using the mask does reduce the number of face touches.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommends wearing non-medical tissue face masks. China has specifically emphasized the importance of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
In Hong Kong, wearing a medical mask on public transport or in crowded places is recommended.
Thai health officials are urging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, which has produced ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, ordered all passengers on trains and coaches to wear medical masks.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; those who cannot buy masks have been advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection-control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close human contact.
Protective measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions particularly affected by the outbreak now prescribe or recommend social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can congregate in one place, as recommended by US government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 (in regions where COVID-19 was not available) to 50, and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned groupings of more than two people.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood to mean that people should expose themselves to total social isolation, rather than remaining in contact with others in alternative ways.
Among others, advice was given to have sex only with your regular partner, with whom you live and in whom you are confident that he does not have the virus or its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are advised to isolate themselves at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation, and many governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that all people in affected areas quarantine themselves.
The strictest quarantine was imposed on high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come into contact with COVID-19 infections, or who have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, have been advised to remain quarantined for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Outbreak control strategies include containing, suppressing, or mitigating the spread of the disease.
Containing the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate those infected, as well as other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
Once the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are focused on mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Suppressing infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as leveling the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health-care services and allow more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage an outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks, and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and canceling public events; community involvement and participation in such measures; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to self-isolated infected individuals and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased production of medical masks and fined for stockpiling excess medicines. UK and US simulations have shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (halting the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak health-care burden by two-thirds and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health-care systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when measures are weakened.
Long-term interventions to suppress a pandemic entail social and economic costs.
Anti-viral drugs approved for COVID-19 do not currently exist, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support.
Steroid use can only do harm.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO views capacity-building and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the primary response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to facilitate the reallocation of resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating non-urgent procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and expanding intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the availability of IVL machines and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection - the so-called "zero patient" - may have occurred.
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Over the course of the month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei Province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a mass case of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at a clinic in Hubei Province, where a doctor, Zhang Tianjin, worked, and reported the case to the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan City on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.
Subsequently, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed the WHO of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported a number of cases of unknown pneumonia that was large enough to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days or so.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of March 26, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and imposed border controls.
As of April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90% of the United States population, were under some form of quarantine, more than 50 million in the Philippines, some 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure had risen to 2.6 billion - about one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the validity of which has not been verified, the date is November 17.
On December 26, a doctor, Zhang Jixian, was working on a case of mass pneumonia of an unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice to this effect.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, police have warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, China's National Health Commission claimed that there was "no clear evidence" that the newly discovered virus could be transmitted from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war."
The events of "the largest quarantine in human history" began to unfold, a sanitary cordon was announced on January 23, and the ban on entry to and from Wuhan was later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province, affecting a total of some 57 million people.
The city banned the use of private transport.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing travel health certificates and extending the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, authorities have introduced telecommuting.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei Province and beyond.
Public transportation has been rescheduled, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Since the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, mainland China had recorded only one case of internal transmission, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely contained and the outbreak in China brought under control.
On March 26, 2020, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry to Hubei, except for Wuhan, would be suspended from March 28 for visa or residence holders.
Those wishing to travel to China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to resume operations and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10 a.m., a national three-minute "minute of silence" was held to mark the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus declared by the State Council to coincide with the Qingming holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay their respects online while maintaining physical distance to avoid a recurrence of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Shinchonji Jesus Church in Daegu.
Shinchongji followers traveled to Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9,336 members of the church, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.
South Korea has launched a program to screen people for the virus, track contacts, and quarantine contacts. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of symptoms through a mobile app for all visitors from abroad, universal testing for the virus, with results available the next day, and expanded testing capacity, allowing up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak, despite not isolating entire cities. Initially, South Korean society was divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for what they saw as an inadequate government response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea recorded the lowest total number of cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, 121 countries applied to South Korea on April 1 for assistance in testing for the virus.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later in the day.
The first measures imposed by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, universities and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani announced on 26 February 2020 that the government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict long-distance travel were announced in March, but heavy inter-city travel continued in the run-up to the Persian New Year.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than a dozen countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that date.
Iran's parliament has been closed, and 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to release temporarily all prisoners who qualify for this category.
The organisation says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed facilities, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day - the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran had recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also believed that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial ability to protect itself against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded a relaxation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, placing more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy under quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entry and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 deaths had already been reported in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were supposed to take place behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conté ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding the protocols for the prioritization of patients that may have to be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China as the world's number one coronavirus killer, with 3,405 deaths reported.
On March 22, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report notes that a combination of two factors may contribute to Italy's high mortality rate - the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the inability to screen everyone who currently has the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus was the calmest of all the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not commit citizens to any form of social distancing or quarantine.
As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously to the dangers faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contacts be avoided, encouraging people to work from home whenever possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all leisure facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised that working citizens would pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than £2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population in times of crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social-distance measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to emergencies.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed through police intervention, fines, and crowd dispersal.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with the exception of those that provide "livelihood services," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest State of Washington in a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15.
On January 29, the White House created a Coronavirus Task Force.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed travel restrictions on visitors from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States did not begin immediately, and as a result, the true scale of the outbreak during this period was obscured.
Testing was hampered by defective test kits released by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government authorization by the end of February to use non-government test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies, and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done by a doctor's prescription).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by February 27.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported, "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's prescription, waited for hours or days to be tested." After the first coronavirus death in the United States was reported in Washington State on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which other states soon declared as well.
Classes were canceled at Seattle schools on March 3, and schools were closed nationwide by mid-March. On March 6, 2020, a team of Imperial College London epidemiologists informed the United States about the projected impact of a new coronavirus on the country.

Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were canceled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, except the UK, for 30 days, beginning on March 13.
The next day, he expanded the restrictions to include the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency, allowing federal funds to be used to fight the crisis.
Since March 15, many businesses have closed or cut hours across the US to help fight the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that 10,700 cases had been reported in New York in 24 hours, more than the total number in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said that social distancing was probably an effective measure, as estimates of the doubling of the number of cases dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, 32,308 cases had been reported in New York, and 672 people had died. On March 26, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States, with 12,841 deaths.
According to media reports on March 30, President Trump has decided to extend the period of social distancing until April 30.
On the same day, the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort docked at the Port of New York.
On April 3, the US recorded 884 deaths from coronavirus within 24 hours.
The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring publicly available information by monitoring, through Vice President Mike Pence's office, public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.
Overall, supporters of President Trump are divided on how well he is handling the crisis.
Some officials and observers have criticized the US dependence on imports of essential materials, including basic necessities, from China.
In mid-January 2020, an analysis of air travel patterns was published in the journal Travel Medicine, which was used to map and predict disease patterns.
According to the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali was named the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared. On February 7, Australia adopted its contingency plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communications when faced with a threat.
On March 21, Australia declared a human biosafety emergency.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures implemented in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from their home countries, which the Chinese authorities authorized.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan evacuations of their citizens.
Pakistan has said it has no intention of evacuating its citizens from China.
On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians / relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate US citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner.
On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways plane chartered by the Government of South Africa departed with 112 South African nationals on board.
Before departure, passengers were medically examined, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were kept in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans who tested negative for coronavirus were evacuated.
Tests were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they all remained under surveillance and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precaution.
On March 20, the US began withdrawing some of its troops from Iraq in response to the pandemic.
On February 5, China's Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at American universities have banded together to collect and send aid to areas of China affected by the virus, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to clinics in Hubei province on January 30. Direct Relief, together with FedEx, sent 200,000 medical masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and bathrobes, by January 30 by air ambulance to the Wuhan Union clinic.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine development and treatment of the coronavirus, as well as to protect populations "at risk in Africa and South Asia" from the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send $2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan has also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey has sent medical equipment, Russia has sent more than 13 tons of medicine, Malaysia has pledged 18 million medical gloves, Germany has sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States has donated 17.8 tons of medicine, and has pledged $100 million in financial support to the affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks, and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution to its member states.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks, and five IVL machines to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic have expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and test kits.
Spain, for example, has recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, which are only 30% accurate, and the Netherlands has recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks, believed to have been manufactured in China, but which later turned out to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations in developing countries.
The WHO commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts to control the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
The WHO noted a clear difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of classifying information to prevent the disease from spreading and contain its spread, and the current crisis, in which the central government "provided regular updates on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year."
On January 23, in response to the central government's decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Gaudin Galea noted that, while "the measure was definitely not recommended by the WHO," it was also "a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the point of greatest spread," and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health." On January 30, after confirming the ability of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of infections in other countries, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth since 2009, when the measure was first implemented during the swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Mr. Tedros Adanom stated that the PHEIC announcement was motivated by "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade," and that "the WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need to provide urgent assistance to countries that "do not have systems in place to identify people who have contracted the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries."
At a press conference on February 11, the WHO officially named the disease COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide "the capacity of the entire UN system to respond to the challenge."
The result was the creation of the UN Crisis Management Team, which coordinates all United Nations responses; these steps, the WHO says, will "focus the response on health, while other agencies can use their expertise to fight the outbreak in broader social and economic terms."
On February 14, WHO and China initiated a joint task force that brought together international experts and WHO field staff in China to help manage the situation domestically and assess "the seriousness of the disease and its contagion," organized seminars and meetings with key national agencies, and conducted field visits to assess "the effectiveness of provincial and district responses, including urban and rural areas." On February 25, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that it is too early to call it a pandemic, but countries must nonetheless be prepared."
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, the WHO sent a joint team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials announced that the probability of global coronavirus transmission would be raised from "high" to "very high" - the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the WHO's executive director for health emergencies, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet's preparedness for reality: it is time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, "and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid a" worst-case scenario. "
Ryan also said that current data do not support the declaration of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean "essentially recognizing that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that the WHO is "deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue." The WHO has been heavily criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including its late declaration of a public health emergency and its classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the negative reaction to the situation, a resignation petition was submitted to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, which had 733,000 signatures as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respecting the human rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to be subjected to life-saving measures, and that it was the responsibility of the Government to organize such measures.
The Panel emphasized that the lack of resources or health insurance should not in any way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, members of minority groups, senior citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to solicit views and provide advice.
The digital node provides information on country-specific policies (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address quarantine and travel restrictions, and help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CCP) have been fired for their quarantine measures in central China, and these dismissals reflected dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with an earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but sided with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.
US President Donald Trump's administration has called the coronavirus "China virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only exacerbates the virus, which has now become a global pandemic," a remark that has in turn been criticized by some commentators, who argue that this approach is racist and "distracts from the US President's administration's inability to contain the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained access to a US government cable that contains a communications strategic ruse apparently concocted by the National Security Council, with references to strategy such as: "It's all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Organizations like Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to help countries afflicted by the virus are part of a" propaganda push "to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of "a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through PR and so-called largesse."
Borrell also said that "China is pushing hard for its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US."
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned by US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The US authorities are also accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
Disputes over medical masks have also arisen between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVL machines destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of support for coronavirus-ridden Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China has responded bilaterally.
This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity. "
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the dispatch of Russian military nurses, specialized disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the world public at a "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italy's foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the help provided.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the US.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering assistance to American counterparts, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO's Defender 2020 military exercise planned for Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states - the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War - will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In today's public health crisis, these exercises are endangering not only the lives of the US military and many European member states, but also those of the countries where the exercises are to be held."
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for help, saying that his country was struggling to combat the epidemic because of a lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health-care and childcare system, paid family leave, and increased public-health funding.
Political scientists had expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. The pandemic has worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in designated places by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak. The pandemic forced countries to enact emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that the move would allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, parliament voted to give Prime Minister Viktor Orbán indefinite powers to govern by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's response to the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply shortages, owing to the global increase in the use of equipment to fight the epidemic, panic buying, and disruptions to production and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings of shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Panic shopping also took place in several localities, leading to the disappearance of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from store shelves, which in turn led to stock shortages.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to the Director General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This spike has led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays of four to six months in the delivery of medical supplies.
It has also caused a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO has warned that health workers will be hit as a result.
In Australia, the pandemic has given Daigou buyers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
Measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products, which proved successful, averted the severe food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy, which has small-scale agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but the industry believes that agricultural prices could rise.
Grocery store shelves remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition.
Similar laws requiring food producers to maintain food supplies in case of emergency exist in Italy.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5% decline in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, a viral outbreak is considered a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demarai of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that market volatility will continue until a clearer picture of potential outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could surpass that of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.
One expert from Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last for up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to be taking "urgent action" after oil prices plummeted because of falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, owing to growing fears about a coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S & P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points - the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices were down more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many believe there is a chance of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and governments.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the hardest-hit sectors, with travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and governments advising against all travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have canceled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for airline tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has never been stronger.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun Yun, the main tourist season for Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of high-profile events, including the annual New Year's Eve Festivals, and private companies have also shut down their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai's Disneyland.
Many New Year's Eve events were canceled and tourist attractions were closed to prevent crowds, such as Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and districts, authorities extended the New Year holidays until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year's celebrations.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have cut sales by 50-60%.
As a result, traffic to shopping malls fell by 33-43% in March compared to February.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that a pandemic-induced recession in Latin America could push 14-22 million more people out of poverty than would otherwise have been the case, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are at home in their home provinces or locked in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that a coronavirus outbreak in the United States could put 47 million people out of work and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social security benefit. Nearly half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to government-subsidized part-time work.
The German part-time wage scheme has also been introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether formally employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often state-funded) mission of ensuring public access to cultural heritage by ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, by supporting artists.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely or had varying degrees of access restricted, and exhibits, events and performances were canceled or rescheduled.
Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also suffered setbacks. The Vatican has announced the cancellation of Holy Week events in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian penitent period, Lent.
Many dioceses advise older Christians to stay home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders are proposing open-air services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels, and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims are no longer present, and later other religious organizations also canceled services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned access by foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most dramatic change in the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events were canceled or rescheduled, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "postponed until after 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling venues around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or canceled.
The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all of their productions.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore ways to continue and share their work online, by hosting live online concerts or Web festivals; this helps artists continue to perform, produce, or publish their work.
Internet memes about the coronavirus have proliferated, many of them humorous and mitigating the anxiety that characterizes periods of uncertainty.
Since the inception of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as people in hot spots in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
News reports in February (when the majority of infections were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who supposedly deserved the virus or who received just retribution for something.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also on the rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in areas affected by the virus, were provided with offline and online support.
Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea signed an early petition calling for a ban on Chinese citizens entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan (# ChinesNot Coming to Japan) dominated Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report rising levels of racism and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," a view that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to Novye Sanjary.
Students coming from northeastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state branch in West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge on them."
In China, the pandemic has reignited xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, calling foreigners "foreign garbage" and objects to be "recycled."
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of the 2019 respiratory coronavirus (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be treated in hospital, or none at all.
The exact mortality rate from the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By March 23, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries is highly contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
Using a real-time polymerase reverse transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test, the test can be performed on respiratory samples taken by a variety of methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
The results are usually available within a period of a few hours to 2 days.
The OT-PCR test, carried out on smears taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, but still multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested during the second week of the disease, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken by suction catheter or sputum products can be used as an alternative.
One early PCR test was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, South Korea's Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-level PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) through the International Reagent Resource to public health laboratories.
One in three genetic tests from older versions of test kits yielded incomplete results because of defective reagents and the narrow testing area of the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples per day, on average, were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of CT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics began testing COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling and processing of tests must comply with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VEKTOR State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be performed in 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct Abbott m2000 testing; previously, the FDA granted such authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because the test does not require a series of temperature cycles, it can produce a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the US, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody that binds in a specific way to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is currently being developed in Taiwan, and it is hoped that results will be available in 15-20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 review of specialist literature concluded that "chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results can be of such value even before symptoms appear."
Typical features detected by CT scans include two-sided multilongitudinal subpleural "matt glass" sealing foci with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posteriory distributions.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestones, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, because many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line testing method in diagnosing COVID-19." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection takes the form of the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity, and for population control purposes.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed at which each system is produced.
CLT typically uses one sample of peripheral blood, though serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.
Unlike PCR, there is no need for blood sampling. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all required registration procedures and can now extend their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency approval test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval to use their test kits, which can detect antibodies in blood samples of IgG and IgA that can fight the virus.
The performance of testing is several hundred samples in a few hours, so this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be identified 14 days after infection.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of having the virus to stay at home: "emergency room staff hand the patient a test tube for a sample," the patient spits in it, gives it back, and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient to other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it is used to transport the patient.
In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors said on March 2 that it was willing to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient settings, up from just 10,700 a week a week a week earlier.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, President of the Institute, Germany's total testing capacity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, rapid testing was being proposed in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests passed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
Researchers at Israel's Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing samples from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analysis only if the combined samples tested positive. In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a 2,000-square-meter temporary emergency laboratory called Huo-Yan (Chinese for "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Construction of the laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and the quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
Following the opening of the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai were immediately opened - in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
By March 4, 2020, daily throughput totaled 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays open multiplex circuits have been released that can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 tubes.
By March, mass testing in the EU, the UK, and the US had become problematic due to shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols, which heat samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) within 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates currently conducts more per capita coronavirus testing than any other country, and most of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to rapid testing capabilities, together with the acquisition of the Huo-Yan Emergency Laboratory in China from Group 42 and BGI.
Deployed in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day, and is the world's first on such a large scale to operate outside of China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are shipped to low-income countries that lack the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, leading to a lack of test kits in the US.
In South Korea, however, experts say the widespread availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, South Korea's government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for more testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The US test kits developed by the CDC were "flawed," so the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test development. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the inaccuracy of the results could be due to poor sampling or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry announced that it would withdraw sets that produced inaccurate results and replace them with other sets - those produced by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets purchased by Slovakia from China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović has proposed dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health claimed that test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and the Ministry "did not use them." The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, the kits were declared unusable.
Quarantine measures for individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as follow-up of individuals with whom such patients had been in contact, had positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vaud, where the first person in Italy died of COVID-19, conducted two rounds of tests on a total population of about 3,400 people at intervals of about ten days.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
Entry to the village was closed and the spread of the infection was completely contained.
With intensive tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and no extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops had to be imposed.
Many events there were canceled, and Singapore began urging residents to stay home on March 28, but schools that ended on March 23 reopened as scheduled.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, but restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, forward their first five positive and first ten negative test results for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of the 16 reference laboratories are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the following graph, the "% of positive results" column depends on the testing policies adopted in a particular country.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of positive results than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of whether they have symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.
Hand washing, also known as "hand hygiene," is the process of cleaning hands to remove impurities, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand-washing with soap at certain "tipping points" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
A person can also contract respiratory diseases, such as flu or a common cold, for example, by touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical points during the day after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing your child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding your child, before eating, and before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after care procedures.
After changing nappies or washing a child going to the toilet.
After shriveling, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, fodder or animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Wash your hands before taking medication or medical procedures to prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, and reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality during home birth.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight increase in the height of children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce mortality from these diseases by up to 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third, comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
Hand-washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory disease (ARI), provided proper habits are developed in every home, school, and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, a major complication of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Overall, diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that hand-washing with soap before and after meals, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to dry skin and consequently damage it.
A 2012 Danish study found that too much hand washing can lead to itchy and flaky skin - a condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
Too much hand washing can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "tipping points" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission: after emptying (urinating, defecating), after washing the baby's buttocks (changing nappies), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before / after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Some other cases where you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shriveling, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
Hand-washing with soap is relatively uncommon in many countries.
A 2014 study in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate, 97%, with the US close in the middle, at 77%; China had the lowest rate, at 23%.
The Philippine Department of Education's Emergency Health Program is an example of a large-scale effort to improve children's health and education.
This national programme is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily dental cleaning with fluorine.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added to the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase solubility.
Water alone is not considered an effective skin cleanser, because fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollutants, are poorly dissolved in water.
Sufficient water, however, facilitates the purification process.
Soap, because of its reusable use, may also contain bacteria that can get on it during previous use.
The small number of studies of bacteria coming into contact with the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests that there is little chance of such ingestion, because the bacteria wash off with the foam.
The CDC still claims that "hand-dispensed liquid soap is the preferred option for hand washing."
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are naturally resistant to antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective vis-à-vis antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised one.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection products, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as the antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health has shown that simple soaps are as effective as conventional antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands.
Hot water comfortable for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 ° C.
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water in removing natural fats that trap contaminants and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became increasingly popular.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of thickeners, such as a carbomer (an acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or humidifiers, such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, to make them user-friendly and reduce the effect of alcohol drying the skin.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively kill germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% - 99.999% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips of both hands should also be thoroughly washed. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing hand washing over disinfectant, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increasing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for proper hand-washing if water and soap are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if they do not contain skin softeners and / or moisturisers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and / or other softeners to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening ingredients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants hardly occur.
The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis has been a factor in choosing disinfectants over soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free products do not cleanse hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as conventional soap and water, as they still leave pathogens in the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be ineffective after repeated use, probably because of progressive skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the US Centers for Disease Control recommends using hand-washing techniques that include the following steps:
Rinse hands under warm or cold running water.
It is running water that is recommended, because standing water can be polluted, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms and the areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just water), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Shave your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing hands in standing water can trigger re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to contaminate. Most often, people neglect areas such as the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent dry hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways to wash hands: pouring water out of a hanging can or a bottled pumpkin and / or using ash when necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as foot taps and other low-cost options.
The foot pedal faucet is a simple construction consisting of a container suspended from a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to release water on the hands, using a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Napkins and Towels at the University of Westminster in London compared the hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and more modern streaming hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the pads of fingers increased by 194% on average, and on the palms by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the pads of fingers increased by 42%, and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the pads of fingers drops to 76% on average, and 77% on the palms of the hands.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at claimed speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms off the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other toilet and toilet users within a radius of up to 2 m.
Using hand dryers with warm air spreads germs within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study evaluating various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Cleaning hands with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling without soap and water.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help reduce infection rates.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water, or gel is used to wash and wipe each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed carefully against each other, fingers crossed.
If there is dirt under your nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Because germs can remain in the water present on hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying your hands, close the tap and, if necessary, close and open any doors with a paper towel.
This avoids re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing practices remain unacceptable in most health-care settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spreading germs.
One study found that proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce catheter-related blood-flow infections by 66%.
The draft WHO guidance on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The review was co-authored by Whitby.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure performance and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization identifies "five moments" when you need to wash your hands:
after exposure to blood or bodily fluids,
before using an antiseptic, as well as
Adding antiseptic chemicals to hand-washing soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps kill bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in environments with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms. "Cleaning" hands before surgery requires a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching them with your hands; use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse hands, sterile hand towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile friction brush, and other sterile cleaning tools under nails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually within 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub your hands too long, say 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after care procedures.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the first 20% of hand washing was found to be the most beneficial, and very few additional benefits were gained when hand washing frequency was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap, washing hands with conventional soap more than triples the frequency of bacterial infections transmitted through food. Comparing hand-washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand-washing with antibacterial soap, on average, for 30 seconds per procedure, showed that treating hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-washing solutions in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium Diphile spores in the hands. Hand hygiene promotion activities in health facilities can include training staff to wash their hands, increasing the availability of hand-washing solutions containing alcohol, and written and oral reminders to staff to wash their hands.
More research is needed on the most effective interventions in different health-care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as cost-effective and important for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to develop the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in much of rural Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are cheap ways to do so.
However, inadequate hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results need to be monitored and evaluated.
One example of advocacy for hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's "Three Star Approach" approach, which promotes simple, cost-effective measures in schools to encourage students to wash their hands with soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that minimum standards are met, schools can upgrade from one to three stars.
The installation of hand washes is one of the possible measures being implemented as part of hand hygiene awareness campaigns to reduce morbidity and infant mortality.
As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of hand-washing emojis.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (Disability-Free Life Years).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "founder of modern nursing."
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, in response to outbreaks of digestive tract diseases and health-care-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US began to promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "proper hand-washing techniques" were posted next to hand-washing facilities in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing one's hands" means showing one's unwillingness to accept responsibility for, or be a part of, something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, a phrase that later became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain of an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed and induced her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed an unethical act were more likely to wash their hands than others, and that hand washes were more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after what they have seen will participate in other "cleansing" compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water but no soap is part of a ritual in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam prescribe mandatory hand washing after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, hand washing before and after every meal is considered essential.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Occupational factor control in connection with COVID-19 implies the application of occupational safety and health practices to control risk and control the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk management is location-specific and task-specific, based on risk assessments, the severity of the epidemic in the community, and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that lower-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and that basic infection control measures are required, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when they show signs of illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in the community or during international travel.
This may include workers who come into contact with the public, for example, in schools, high-density workplaces, and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-performance air filters, the use of protective shields, and the availability of personal protective equipment in the event of exposure to a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers medical and morgue personnel who come into contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to be at high risk, and the risk increases to very high when such personnel perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect / process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk-control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of their own illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible infection.
Business patterns can change both with respect to the types of goods for which there is demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (for example, making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or servicing without getting out of the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographic regions affected by COVID-19. Protection can be provided through the Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan.
The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.
The plans also identify the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans can be guided by recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic include reducing the spread of the virus among personnel, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are influenced by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
A hierarchy of risk controls is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such controls according to effectiveness.
When it is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19 disease, the most effective engineering and technical means of safety, followed by administrative measures and, finally, means of personal protection, are the most effective.
Safety engineering means isolating employees from work-related risks and not relying on employee behavior, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures imply changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the worker, appropriate in size (e.g. respirators), used consistently and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that jobs with the least risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic responses to the epidemic, which are recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, advice for sick workers to stay home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including covering their mouths with their hands when coughing and sneezing, provision of wipes and garbage cans, preparedness for remote or shift work if necessary, guidance for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever, fever, and many other symptoms stop, for at least 24 hours, without using fever killers or other symptom-reducing drugs, and that policies be flexible on sick leave, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensure that employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 meters) with people for whom there is no confirmed or suspected infection with COVID-19, but who are likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community in which the business is located, or due to the person's recent travel to COVID-19 locations.
Administrative measures for such groups and higher-risk groups include advising sick workers to stay home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual means, setting shift schedules, stopping non-critical trips to COVID-19 distribution areas, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum to answer worker concerns, providing relevant training for workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protective measures, educating workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, ensuring proper use of such devices, providing resources and a work environment conducive to personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing of ID, restricting access to the workplace by customers and the public, providing guidance on the need for hand washing and other protective measures against COVID.
In rare cases, workers at such risk may be required to wear respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, the proper safety of workers and other passengers requires measures such as isolating the sick person from other people within 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person, providing the sick person with a mask, or asking the sick person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.
Minor crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when coming into contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, a persistent cough, or breathing difficulties.
In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing travel in the event of illness, self-isolation, and immediately informing the ship's medical center if someone on board has fever or other symptoms.
In the case of schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
When there is minimal or moderate infection in the community, social-distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling trips for face-to-face meetings, gatherings, and other public activities, such as physical activity or choir singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, adjusting arrival and departure times, limiting minor visits, and using separate health-care facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At significant rates of prevalence in the community, long-term absenteeism may be considered in addition to social-distance strategies. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to come into contact with persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical personnel, including the use of suitable personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, employees should clean and disinfect their uniforms and gear prior to reuse with household cleaning aerosols or wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and dispose of used personal protective equipment, and use and wash clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of health-care and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when they perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect / process samples from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Aerosol-producing procedures include sounding, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include those who handle the bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections at the time of death; if they perform an autopsy, they fall into the very high-risk category. Additional engineering safety features for such risk groups include the use of segregated facilities for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 illnesses, including aerosol-producing procedures.
In some health facilities and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled with the precautions set out in Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be assigned to segregated waiting areas on the basis of suspected COVID-19 contamination. Among other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the US, NIOSH-approved face masks with an N95 filter or higher must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort for the employee. The WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not a physiological one.
The WHO recommends using only surgical masks for staff carrying out screening at the point of admission.
Individuals collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or vectors of the disease without aerosol-producing procedures are advised by the WHO to wear a surgical mask, protective goggles or face shields, a bathrobe and gloves.
In aerosol-producing procedures, a N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the paucity of personal protective equipment worldwide, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment by using telemedicine, using physical barriers such as transparent windows, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19 only for those providing immediate care, using only those personal protective equipment required for the task at hand, using the same respirator for prolonged periods of time while working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the personal protective equipment supply chain, and recommending that masks not be used for those without symptoms.

THEME: [Covid-19] Lifting the burden and preparing for the future
DATE / TIME: March 14, 2020, 00: 24 UTC
RESOLUTIONS: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we are living in unusual circumstances.
COVID-19 is a phenomenon that has shone a light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to one another.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our interventions depends on the capacity for empathy, cooperation, and development of communities around the world that underpins such an organization.
We have seen the camaraderie and caring relationship between all of our colleagues reflected in emails, calls and chats - a remarkable testament to the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.
It is with great gratitude and pride that I speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the appreciation for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And it is possible because of your work, whether it is to keep sites running, to be paid for by our colleagues, or to protect the safety of communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, and that is more important today than ever before.
At a time like this, what matters to the world is not only what we do, but also how we do it.
Because of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to the way we work together beginning in the coming week.
Adjustment of our work order and schedules
As Robin previously said, the "c-team" met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In the course of the conversation, we discussed our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to defuse tensions and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back down, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
We expect to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare days off: if you can work more hours normally, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether caring for loved ones, buying groceries, or going to the doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not keep track of your working hours.
If you get sick, don't work.
This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
No sick leave or compensatory time off is required: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Brian from T & C Ops so that T & C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation.)
Hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirm our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Each person will be paid at normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can yield surprising results, especially in times like these.
Again, this is about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered essential.
We should always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current targets and shift the focus to support delivery, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
A slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work "twice as hard to catch up" once the pandemic is over.
You do not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines where possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension for our 2019-2020 plan, thereby providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to prioritize critical work, self-help, and caring for loved ones, while ensuring that everyone who needs or wants to work a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning workload and strain across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, providing representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this effort.
Office Condition, Risks, and Cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to many precautions, we have hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevator lobbies through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules of care, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our DC office is part of the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all DC-based staff its COVID-19-related policies.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia switched completely to telecommuting, following instructions from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting space in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into a course of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and send the materials in advance for review.
By default, use video communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.
For convenience, appoint a facilitator - a person who will track the arrival of questions in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as a person responsible for keeping notes (or joint notes).
If you need a convenient headset, contact technical support via e-mail.
Take advantage of the benefits of the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.
Join the # removies channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics manuals available in the form of webinars to promote the efficiency of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded mass events such as "editathons" until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We understand and advise that our requests for such waivers and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant activities, and no one will be penalized for involuntary delays or changes in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only frustration at the interruption of work, but also some sense of relief at understanding and being able to focus on one's own communities, Wikimedia, and more.
Looking ahead, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide a community space to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send you an invitation to a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to share more up-to-date information, answer your questions, and spend time connecting together.
We are together in this situation and ready to help everyone we can.
However, you can still receive information from such e-mail correspondence, and other important information about COVID-19 can still be obtained from Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflows, reporting issues, or other assistance, please contact CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and liaison as needed.
If you have privacy concerns, contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a repudiation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible ongoing need for a radical new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and ensure that we can continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work as hard as possible when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and gut.
AC2 inhibits the activity of the relevant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for treating cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptide domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, its enzymatically active domain hits the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar lung cells of type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of arteries of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 iRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, separates the carboxylic end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilatorial angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradykinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid conveyor and is present in Hartnoop's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding the S1 adhesive protein SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires priming the protein S with the serin protease of the TMPRSS2 carrier, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool. This has led some to suggest that lowering levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend the continuation of standard therapy with ACE and ARB inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of contracting pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with lower pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at general pneumonia risk. "
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of exposure is 30 minutes, in addition to the exposure duration of 24 hours.
There is some evidence that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classic rhACE2 inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases with elevated circulating angiotensin II. The administered rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile phone applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed and are officially supported by the authorities.
Several variants of contact tracking applications have been developed.
This has triggered a debate about privacy issues, especially with respect to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Softer options include using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate Bluetooth-based functionality for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has partnered with Alipay to roll out an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is in use.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be placed under government control. Northern Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-enabled app, StopKorona!, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides rapid communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that a contact tracking app is in the final stages of development and will be available for deployment within weeks. Similar apps are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an app with a geozoning function, which aims to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who live in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a security professor at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false alarms and potential inefficiencies if the app is used by only a small fraction of the population.
Given concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple has limited the types of organizations that can offer coronavirus-related applications in the App Store to "official" or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have raised concerns about the impact of mass surveillance of the public through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question has been raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure put in place to deal with a coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat disappears.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Organizations have announced eight conditions that they place on public projects:
Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
Increased monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by sunset clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of data must be protected, and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuses, must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, eliminating the need to download the app and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to raw location data also have large potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication purposes (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including tracking data on mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined it to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
Not only did the government use this information to alert citizens to potential contacts with infected individuals, but it also made location information publicly available, made possible by significant changes to data protection legislation in the wake of the MERS outbreak in the country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering both centralized and confidential systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details had not yet been released.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's approach to other mobile phones.
Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing with confidentiality (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and that all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location or crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform builds on research in Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technology that allows users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that share the same approach and protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global interoperability of tracking and reporting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the source code for BlueTrace used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, which they claimed would ensure privacy, and which relies on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve privacy.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is to be deployed in three stages:
Deployment of tools to enable governments to create official applications to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, while preserving data confidentiality
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve ongoing surveillance problems by first implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way when the threat disappears.
Drug repositioning (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task change, or therapeutic redirection) is the reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or a medical condition other than the one originally intended for development.
This is one area of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of recovalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-acting proteins, each with several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADF-ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study studied several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analyzed their similarity in structure to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being investigated in a Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment regimen was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is permitted under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial regimen.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C, and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
New York University Langone School of Medicine is studying the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is "unequivocally effective."
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug tested negative after an average of 4 days, while the 45 patients who did not took the drug had a duration of 11 days.
In Wuhan, a study followed 240 patients with pneumonia, half of whom received favipiravir and the other half umiphenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority has reminded the public that results showing the drug's efficacy are scarce and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to replenish its stockpile, and that it would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration of the possibility of purchasing the drug, which may prove less effective in neglected cases of the disease.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients trying to become pregnant.
One study of a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that "no efficacy was found."
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdechivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdechivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by University Hospitals of Cleveland; one in patients with a moderate form of the disease, and the other in patients with a more severe form.
Three trials for intravenous vitamin C infusions for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19 are currently under way: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one placebo-free trial (Italy).
Trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in New York State on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat asthma, for use in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with a new coronavirus.
The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, involves 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe conditions to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
For the study, called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization were invited.
Pregnant, breast-feeding, and non-effective contraceptive women cannot participate in the study.
Several coagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Authority to publish guidelines for its use.
On April 14, a multi-center study involving 300 patients on the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has focused on the reprofiling of approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also for trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab # COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available until at least 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak spread around the world, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Vaccine Initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, scale-up, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technological platforms under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, iRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 candidate vaccines have been announced, but there is little publicly available information on them (presumably at the planning or development stage).
Phases I-II include pre-testing for safety and immunogenicity, typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multi-site, with more accurate and effective doses determined.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, in which drugs are tested for efficacy in preventing disease while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical studies).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular-clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDEO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the goal of starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the start of work on their vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used to vaccinate against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the beginning of trials.
On February 27, 2020, Genex's subsidiary, NuGenex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for vaccine development and production.
The partners also announced plans to conduct a pre-clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even on an accelerated basis, vaccine development would take at least a year and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, announced that it had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, to which the German government objected.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; it is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate could begin testing in humans as early as the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI), France, announced a $4.9 million investment in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh.
CEPI's other investment partners in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford, and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice, stating that "MNA injected subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, inducing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that showed up 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, possibly in the form of a nasal spray.
With bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled the resources of IBM's supercomputers with those of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits in addition to preventing disease.
Another randomized study in Australia involved 4,170 health-care workers.
Vaccines under development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain biosafety level 3 infection in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for humans to treat SARS.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that was under way at the time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that passed Phase I human clinical trials, and three other vaccines, all of which were viral-vector vaccines under development, two adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Conspiracy theories have been circulating on social media claiming that COVID-19 is not a new virus and that a vaccine against it already exists.
Posts on social media quoted some patients as claiming patents on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as the coronavirus SARS, as well as on vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease develops into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mostly spread through close human contact, often through microscopic droplets released into the air when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets are formed when exhaled, they usually pose a threat when on the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with a suspected illness and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks vary, with some agencies recommending that they not be used at all, some recommending their use, and others requiring it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, coughing, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent pain or a feeling of constriction in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking, blue face or lips; if these symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.
Less common may be symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.
There are also gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, in different percentages.
Some of the cases reported in China initially showed only a feeling of chest compression and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin within 11.5 days of infection. Evidence suggests that not all infected people are symptomatic.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with an asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily report on April 1; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have high concentrations of the virus.
Loud speech releases more droplets into the air than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that when coughs are open, droplets can spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.
The virus is not usually transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission of the virus particles is still possible, and testing of air treated by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus can spread through feces, yet the risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the virus can spread before symptoms appear, but the risk is small.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 others.
Specifically, the virus was found to live on a cardboard surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These values, however, vary with humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents, when used properly, have a pretty useful anti-infection effect: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and can also remove it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, while in the sixth patient, the highest level of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of the test.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Once outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which uncovers its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar lung cells of type II.
The virus connects to ACE2 and enters the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein, the "spike" (ash meter).
Twelve per cent of infected people admitted to Wuhan Hospital were diagnosed with acute myocardial lesions, which are more common in severe cases.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disturbances observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large numbers because they are involved in this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients in the ITU with COVID-19, and may indicate an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of patients killed by COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropicism to ACE2-expressing airway epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF T cells were found to be correlated with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
An autopsy also found lymphocytic infiltrates.
The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory swab samples taken from the nasopharynx, but a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken every two weeks, and the results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at this point in time, as well as possible past infection, were under development but not yet widely available.
China's experience with these tests shows that they are only 60-70% accurate.
On March 21, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use later this month.
Bilateral multilongitudinal subpleural "matt glass" sealing foci with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posteriory distributions are frequent symptoms detected early in the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestones (a lobular thickening of a partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed during the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVS syndrome); leukoerythroblatic response
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, respecting respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, good hand hygiene is recommended.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue facemasks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.
Distance guidelines also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Because vaccine development is not expected to be completed until 2021 at the earliest, much of the response to COVID-19 is focused on reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as "reaching the plateau."
The CDC also recommends washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if the hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before eating and after soaking, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand sanitizers (at least 60% alcohol), but only when soap and water are not available.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for hand antiseptic treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturiser.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supporting therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. The WHO and China's National Health Commission have published guidelines for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures that may involve airdripping, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission, especially in health-care settings.
In addition to standard precautions for contact and air, the CDC has issued guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above, respirators are preferable to medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used off-label, their effectiveness in protecting against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, at the very least, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the forms of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require artificial lung ventilation or alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided by using a nasal airflow-intensive oxygen cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two options is as effective for critically ill patients as IVL.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical pulmonary ventilation, if available, because it significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe illness is much higher for the elderly (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health-care systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.
In one study in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation support for lung function, and 1.4% died.
In China, roughly 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing artificial ventilation to the lungs is becoming more difficult as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops with COVID-19, and oxygenation become increasingly problematic.
Inhalation-assisted IVVs and VACs are needed to deliver as much oxygen as possible to the lungs and to ensure minimal ventilation damage that can lead to pneumothorax.
On older fan models, high VAC may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Remdeshivir seems the most promising.
New drug development may take until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are participating in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
Its use has not been subject to clinical trials, which should be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.
To log in, users must enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contact" using surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
When a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been put in place to ensure quarantine and protection for those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
Recognition technology has been introduced in Russia to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said mobile network operators reported that "40% of people still continue to move around."
The German government ran a 48-hour weekend programming marathon that involved more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kirsti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and the economic downturn are ideal conditions for damaging people's mental health and wellbeing."
The disease can be mild, with little or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases, such as a common cold.
Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms can take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data are not available for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can infect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Thrombosis abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while kidney dysfunction occurred in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 had elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, of which five patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage studies, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of posthumous lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths recorded by China's National Health Commission, heart problems were caused by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of medical resources and the region's socioeconomic situation may also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality by condition vary due to such regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
Inadequate counting of mild cases can lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms overall, and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.
A Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who recovered from the disease had had their lungs shrink by 20-30%, and scans revealed damage.
Once recovered, it can also lead to "After Intensive Care" syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who recovered from the virus were developing resistance to it.
Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered probable, but cases have also been reported in which coronavirus tests were still positive after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are believed to have been exacerbated by a protracted course of the disease, rather than re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, of animal origin, and an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, identifies December 1, 2019 as the earliest date for the first case.
According to official data published by the WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of transmission, and are also affected by the amount of testing, the quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency codes to the disease: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV- 2.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822 / 2,240,191).
Some other methods include the Disease Mortality Rate (CFR), which measures the percentage of diagnosed patients who die as a result of the disease, and the Infection Mortality Rate (IFR), which measures the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of a specific segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies gives an idea of how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are dead.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, Germany's health-care system was not overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies based on blood donations.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown that mortality rates are higher for men.
Men over the age of 50 are the most at risk; the gap between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender-specific immunological differences, lower smoking rates among women, and co-morbidity among men (for example, hypertension, which manifests itself in men at a younger age than in women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and ARVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health-care workers, especially nurses, are women, so they are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease - COVID-19.
The head of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Guebreyesus, explains: "CO" means "crown," "VI" means virus, "D" means disease, and 19 means the year the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, the WHO additionally uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19."
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as a "coronavirus."
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the naming of diseases and viruses, the WHO recommended the use of the terms "2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names for viruses and diseases.
On February 11, 2020, the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published.
Because of volume constraints in standard supply chains, some digital-service providers print medical materials, such as swab swabs for nasal swabs, as well as parts for IVL machines.
In one such case, an Italian clinic was in urgent need of a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it in time, while a local manufacturing facility was converted and able to print the necessary 100 valves overnight.
Since the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation, and false information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment, and other aspects have proliferated on the Internet at a high speed.
It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
Studies have not confirmed the spread of the virus to pigs, ducks, and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs to treat it.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready-made vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so previous SARS-CoV studies have been used in research.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers aim to create a whole-virionic vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response by the human body to a new infection, COVID-19.
The second strategy, the development of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to destroy the S-thorn protein that helps the virus get into the receptor of the enzyme ACE2.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method for making a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Drugs approved for malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral reprofiling accounts for most of China's research; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also under consideration, including Remdeshivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of Remdeshivir are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the United States, China, and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 penetration through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires accommodating the spike protein with transmembrane serin 2 protease (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without more detailed study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in treating COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinetic properties. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug has entered a Phase 2 non-randomized trial, which is being conducted nationally in Italy, after positive results were obtained in patients with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with serum testing for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of COVID-19 patients to people who need them is now seen as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tried in treating patients with SARS, but the results have been inconclusive.
Neutralizing the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis, can be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as those using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, could be scaled up.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of syndromes with a high degree of similarity
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who later contracted and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
