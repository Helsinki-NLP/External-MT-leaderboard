White pawn at f3, black pawn at e6, white pawn at g4, black queen at h4 - chess and mat! This is what is jokingly called in chess circles the  mat of the madman .
White: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawn on a7 and b7, king on a8, fool on b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the turn on a6, after which black has only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their fool to any other square on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, white moves their pawn from b6 to b7 and offers chess and mat. In the second situation, white takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
