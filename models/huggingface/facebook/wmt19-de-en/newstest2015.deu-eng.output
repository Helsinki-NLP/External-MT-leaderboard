The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is meeting his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security ties on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to cement economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after speeding motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was impounded after the rider drove it at 125km / h in a 70km / h zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125km / h.
Police say the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued driving on Burgess Road before turning into bushland, where officers lost sight of it.
The motorbike and a person matching the rider's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to stop and reckless driving.
He is due to appear before Karratha Local Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and impounded for three months.
George Webster charged with Naim and Pitlochry hotel rapes
A man is on trial for raping women at two hotels.
George Webster, 28, had the charge read out at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The indictment says Webster assaulted her while she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, in the Scottish Highlands, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set a trial date for November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to make organizing unions a civil right.
"As unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
So I am proud to join civil rights icon John Lewis in introducing the Employee Empowerment Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options for discrimination for organizing unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
Amending the national labor code to create a way for workers exposed to discrimination to organize union representation, to seek justice in civil courts - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time, which millions of Americans still remember, when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that Hedki Tojo's militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognized that "workers" rights to unify and bargain and act together are guaranteed. "
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that the workers would have to organize and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to safeguard and improve labor and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements restricting this right or seeking to diminish it are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country was advising other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and then for that union to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
Now that these rights have come under fire in America, it is very wise indeed to revisit the American ideal, according to which working people must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all Louisiana abortion clinics to close
A US federal judge temporarily halted implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday that lawyers say may have led to the closure of all five of the state's abortion clinics.
The measure, made law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and set to take effect on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to purchase patient admission rights at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that for the time being doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions while they apply for such a right.
"Plaintiffs may continue to operate in accordance with the law while seeking these rights," federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
A hearing for the judge is scheduled within a month to make the law more durable.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means Louisiana women are escaping a sneaky law that seeks to take away their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for referral rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state's remaining clinics to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that doctors' referral rights impose unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents counter that the measures are intended to protect women's health, although some have also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient admission rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor would not perform the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their applications for patient referral rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analysed medical data from more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 per cent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said those living in rural and remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers looked at the women's medical care over seven years.
Dr Jordan said a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing conditions and social and economic status also affected her chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why out-of-town women were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to reduce distances, she suggested that one possible remedy would be to increase the service of flown-in doctors to enable specialists to care for women closer to where they live, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr Jordan said the study showed poor long-term survival rates in women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and highlighted the need for better treatment and screening strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres bemoan falling homeowner numbers
The fall, combined with a sharp fall in the number of homeowners under 35, could see garden centres lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "core age group for gardening products," according to a study by the HTA, reported in the Financial Times.
The report said tenants spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that people with homes spend on their gardens.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas with no gardens, the popular method of paving front gardens for parking purposes and declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, which makes an estimated £5 billion a year in sales.
Greater London, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent over a six-year period, has reported the lowest spending on garden products per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser for the RHS, said: 'Container gardening is very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move.'
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the "golden age" of gardening retailing, owing to rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 "s to the mid-1990" s.
He also predicted an improved market situation this year due to better weather following unfavourable weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state-run PTV television station.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers had been able to push the protesters out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped broadcasting for about 40 minutes, but has since resumed broadcasting.
At the same time, around 3,000 protesters tried to get to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence.
About a kilometer away, they clashed with security forces armed with sticks and stones.
Police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but Sharif rejects it.
The country's army, meanwhile, is calling for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without resorting to violence."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already staged several coups.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May's parliamentary election.
Protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to enter Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spying report
Turkey's foreign ministry has summoned the country's longest-serving US diplomat to investigate a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the chargé d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries spied on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's main intelligence agency was also targeting Ankara provoked a much more angry response from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Train drivers threaten consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The strike announced for 18 to 21 o'clock affects all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and suburban rail traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said Sven Schmitte, district chairman of the German Locomotive Drivers "Union (GDL) in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant outages.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
GDL did not say where it planned to strike, however, making it difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Majorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The head of the Calvià police force on the holiday island of Majorca has been arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Superintendent José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption allegations against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Majorcan anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the disgruntled nightclub owners said the nepotism of the authorities was having a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money any more, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer with a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio on 24 men during a booze-fuelled trip.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of people taking part in the notorious booze-fuelled pub trips.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, has been forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organiser Carnage are jointly facing a €55,000 ($73,000) fine.
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of alcohol-related accidents, including the trend of "balconing," where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather affecting flights from Adelaide Airport
SPRING has brought a wintry surprise to South Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
By 9pm, another 5mm of rain had fallen on the city, after 6.6mm had already fallen on Sunday night.
The latest rainfall was the result of a series of short, blustery showers, including a downpour that began just before 8pm, bringing nearly 4mm of rain in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell back to a high of just 15.8C on Monday.
The gusty weather conditions are believed to have led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7: 30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts were reaching about 50km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane also had to take off on a second landing and finally touched down at around 8.40pm.
The flight delay subsequently caused delays to some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A top temperature of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for big networking
Faced with the galloping technological progress that threatens to transform our comfortable homes into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies takes solace in an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my eyes fall on the spiral cable that connects the handset to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a reasoning behind this: if the cable were not there, all the receivers would fly around the house in no time, and that would be a lot more retro.
Anyway, applies on the ecstatic (ecstatic?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in your living room today, you are merely saying that you fundamentally reject television.
Why these considerations?
Because the crowding of the Ifa at the Funkturm this week once again demonstrates our utter incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who used to have a blind command of the washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out before him with unbelievably vain expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies," the press office promises us.
Yes, is it still possible?
What are we supposed to talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such cottage cheese?
After all, for the last 20 years or so, the main aim has been to make sure that we are able to network our homes as efficiently as possible.
So that the yogurt orders itself, so that the fire alarm tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could switch the air conditioning from the office to our imminent arrival...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But one dream is sure to come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, loudly say "Suck it up!" - and the vacuum cleaner starts at home.
Insane.
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown merchandise are blurring," murmurs an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to headphones, the steam oven sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza will take in the oven, which is of no use because we are stuck in traffic.
From daily practice we also know: If a new-fangled device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to schools after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters as rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed while the territory recovered from the fighting.
The school launch brought a sense of joy and expectation to the rocket-scarred communities of southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We are a bit scared but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and a local English teacher.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Education Ministry said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town heavily scarred by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.
Israel is calling for Hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting to be handed over.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel disputes these claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are militants, but has provided no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other strikes.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people remain in shelters and fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU vice-president Strobl questions NPD ban procedure
In view of the NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD in the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," Strobl, who is also head of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, told the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and one that rather leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
In Sunday's vote, the NPD narrowly failed at the five percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003, because the Federal Constitution at that time also had informants at the top of the NPD.
In December 2013, after a long period of preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new proposal in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join in.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now being housed in tents at Neulands Platz.
The first reception centre for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Home Office has had three Red Cross tents erected next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These outrageous actions are fuelling further reservations of the citizens and do not give the district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, leader of the Green Party in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party is demanding that the Harburg district administration make unused houses available for housing.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first reception are the rush of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced their strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely watched index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 per cent in August, RP data showed on Monday.
The increase brings the total increase in June, July and August to 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
Tim Lawless, head of research at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne were driving a two-tier market.
Figures from RP Data show house prices in Sydney rose 16.1 per cent last year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent respectively.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by government spending cuts, with prices up just 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless said that with spring now approaching, there would be a rise in the number of properties for sale in the coming months, which would put the market to "a real test."
"If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements made by the managing director Peer Medau and accuses him of posing "like a general."
The style of the college is not, the statement said.
Thus, the Medau family had already been orally informed "in mid-June of the university's request.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely false, "says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-arrangements or even decisions," but that there are "preferences."
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was no talk of a nine-metre-wide road.
As things stand, it is 5.50 metres wider than before, "explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that in future their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university.
Parking is not allowed at all, because, as with other public parking lots, this can now be intelligently solved.
Thinking of the residents
The nursery, which is on the site and would lead down the driveway to the parking deck on its doorstep, will "not be affected," according to the university president.
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the crèche, but also about the residents at the junction to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it is about much more than the individual interests of the men's medallists, "Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental advisory board of the nursery, with the development of the road would be justified "one of the few natural spots Coburg gets lost," "can decide the reader itself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Authority, will inform the city councillors about the structural development of the university until 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau informed parents of the nursery's plans last week.
Accordingly, the access road for the new parking deck will not lead via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but via Medau-Berg.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre in two lanes.
According to projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of around 2000 vehicles a day.
The city has so far declined to comment on the project.
Glandorf retires from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited above all health problems for this decision.
The decision was not an easy one for me, it has matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals from my body and finish my career in the national team, "the 2007 world champion said on his Facebook page.
He is retiring from international football with a record of 167 caps and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the powerful full-back wants to continue scoring goals for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation" with the Icelander, who will announce his squad for the internationals against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they will inspire my long-time team-mates and my successors.
But I want to stay healthy for my club for the next few years as well, which requires longer regeneration breaks, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-hander even feared his career was over in 2012 after a heel infection.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further surgeries followed.
Glandorf then announced a lawsuit against the team doctor and the dispute ended in a settlement.
Twelve years of a professional and eleven years of a national team career pass without a trace.
I have some health issues that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
Then there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I realized that I can control my head, but not deceive my body, "explained Glandorf in an interview to the magazine" Handball Time. "
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
'When everyone is pulling strings, I'm always ready to talk, 'the father-of-two told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012, I have also become quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the World Cup title in 2007 and winning the Champions League in 2014, he also won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also won the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrank 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter from April to the end of June 2014.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming provisional calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring, while investment fell.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, GDP for the first half of the year is up 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The castle town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
This is the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cyclists "paradise near the Netherlands.
With their registration, over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through Münsterland.
This tour was advertised in various trade journals and was offered to interested parties.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know Münsterland better in this way, "said the cyclists looking forward to the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the embankment, where the start took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude difference, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude difference and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude difference, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were catered for en route in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organiser Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a great experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents, "Heinz Lölfing summarizes this event positively.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015, hopefully with nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoir
In "Monk and Warrior," Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, has put on paper 287 pages more philosophical testimony than biography.
The Munich native, born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs not chronologically but more thought scraps for thought scraps, introducing each chapter with a suitable song text.
And he is unsparingly honest: from his onset as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness out.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Abstract but all the more important concepts also occupy a great deal of space: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - he tries to get to the bottom of all this, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was influenced not only by music (the opera lover turned soul and rock musician), but also by his stay in prison.
The latter also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction," as he says, "by omitting all that is unnecessary."
Between all his high-minded views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about brawls in a restaurant frequented by GIs, or a crazy car ride in which he targeted a tree head-on.
Here, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is based on the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a kid - would go to the pub with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I've never had a conversation like that with him.
For much of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner reading the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's day, he got a glimpse of what life might have been like for him.
It's a bit lighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep labyrinths with bursts of flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry away.
As I walked around, I realised that he had been doing this for years to put food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents "affections.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother was unwell towards the end of her life that we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant, cropped beard.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been captivated by the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at just 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage imitating people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in his profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but from 1975 to 1985 I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star on television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Because his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black," Henry performed his comedy there for five years.
It was very uncomfortable for my family.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just passing the time or stepping on the spot a little bit."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class white guy in tights and a cabbage hat.
So I was very scared.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should give it a try.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few of the words in your mouth and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
'That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.
Rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car crash and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed." "
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the crowd.
"A little voice said to me," You've got to get through 10 minutes while they fix the computer. ""
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue as soon as the issue was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave that to someone else.
'You're in a play, so stay in your role. '
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lyrics for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That, too, went down well, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny." "
He says this, of course, in a thunderous voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is punctuated by humorous outbursts as he repeatedly imitates characters.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I think that kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
If you keep looking for that, you're going to come up against a wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don't get as much as I used to.
I ask him if he'll ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party Ansar Allah said.
The entrance to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media have reported traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Houthi threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the government's resignation.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for nearly two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main access roads to Sanaa.
Bloody fighting with the Yemeni army continues to erupt in the surrounding area.
Kenya registers officials to curb "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun registering all state officials biometrically to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payrolls.
Employees who fail to register over the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government notice said.
The Government believes thousands of people will continue to receive pay rises even after they leave public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was lost in payments to "ghost employees" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officers will now have to appear at identification centres over the next two weeks to ensure their biometric registration data is included, a government statement said.
Anyone who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the statement added.
"This approach will make a significant contribution to streamlining the civil service by establishing the actual number of civil servants and also cleaning up the payroll at both levels of government - eliminating the" ghost workers, "" said Anne Waiguru, cabinet secretary at the Department of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are seeking 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings, in a civil case at the Düsseldorf regional court.
That was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The statement of claim states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and classic cars and charged Berthold Albrecht higher than the purchase price actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in school, 23 of them as a headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many experienced Petershausen and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his desire to see the human being in the pupil.
Snezka is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Northern Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, after four years of high school, he became interested in the teaching profession.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight wagon.
So Richter made it to Senkendorf in Upper Franconia.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the nearest train station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, walk three kilometres across the entire city to school and return in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter was given a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
He took his first state examination in 1951 and his second in 1954 after three years as a teacher.
Since Upper Franconia had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service flat" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room servant's apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968 / 69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move into the present building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter retired.
Manfred Richter praises the straightforward generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop built at municipal expense and, during the expansion in 1997, basements built, although this was not eligible for subsidies under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled with gratitude.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had answered a speech by a school board on law and justice: "One must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "That does not always succeed." Whether he means only his pupils or also his own six children, is not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter's actions were sometimes unconventional.
If pupils beat themselves up, they were not punished by him and were not condemned to sit down.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the good of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
The latter persuaded the non-partisan judge after his retirement to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list.
But Richter was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-CYCLE TOUR 700 cyclists make stopovers in the spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists stop off in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten on their tour, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of people resting made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and their entourage enjoyed a break in the lower spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and later an open-air party in Schotten's Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday things got serious: the cyclists tackled the first stage, the 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had taken part in the race in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and Petra Schwing-Döring, head of the company's own operations in Bad Salzhausen.
All sorts of good things had been prepared for refreshment of body and mind: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 trays of apple, plum, streusel and cheesecake, which the able cyclists enjoyed wonderfully.
"Only country women can bake such cakes," praised one participant from Aulthieebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be bought at the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnastics club.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and won enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
One gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserves it, after all, he has already reattached broken bicycle chains today."
In the meantime, the mayor and the plant manager still had work to do: They were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the Trinkkurhaus and took the opportunity to promote Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Promotion manager Tobias Hagen, who has been part of the tour as tour leader since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, could only take a short breather, as he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he used three phones and a radio to communicate with his staff and the 15-strong motorcycle squad of Hesse police, wrote Facebook posts and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but cyclists have also come from Gießen or Fulda, Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a little on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had been given a beautiful festive ambience and, of course, delicacies, such as tarte flambées with well-chilled feather whites, had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as a board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many businesses in Scotland."
Afterwards DJ Tobias Hagen released the dance stage.
Despite the sporting activity on the bicycle, the opportunity to move freely under the open sky was eagerly seized.
Increasingly, citizens mingled with the guests, who were just as taken with the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day the cyclists visited the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'plotting' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "plotting against the government," local media agencies report.
Police officials had no immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 senior police officers, Hurriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly forming an organised criminal organisation and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described their actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Gulen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People's Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, principal of the Slavyansk school that Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in later life.
The first day of school of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She arrives with a haughty haughtiness from the world of banking, media management and the Tory party's inner circle.
And she has her own front-line experience.
Her career began at global management consultancy Bain and Co., after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson's parent company's top job went to a younger male colleague.
Her severance package was said to be nearly £1 million.
Their political ranking is solid, too.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Back in May, I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC at the heart of public life as a vast and complex entity, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwards to the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outwards as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly that calls for complete comprehensive reform.
But what incoming chairman would risk running, banging on everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps losing his job in the process?
It is a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are also still interested in seeing the BBC reduced in size - power, money and status obsolete.
As competition approaches and new technology threatens old, convenient certainties, the forthcoming negotiation of the licence fee poses particular dangers for the BBC.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is surely the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 per cent of households and costs just 40p a day each.
And it seems the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale, with 53 per cent supporting it today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
Viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my phone and watch missed programmes later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a much-loved and respected institution.
It needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one.
Texas Perry Says Disparaging Tweet Was Unauthorized
A tweet from Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry's official account on Sunday included a disparaging remark about the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another from Perry's account, which denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
'I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it, 'the later post read.
Aides to Perry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets originated from Perry's official account, it was not clear who was actually running the feed.
The earlier tweet painted an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding for her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads: 'I don't always drive drunk with three times the legal alcohol level... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry if he spews it out.'
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not tasked with leading the grand jury investigation into Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio special prosecutor selected by a Republican judge.
Perry has pleaded not guilty, calling the charges a political ploy.
His high-profile legal team petitioned the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charges, arguing that the law targeting the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally vague.
Perry halted $7.5 million of state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigates state corruption cases in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
That veto prompted a public complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group.
Perry's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential run, Perry addressed speculation that he would quit by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake with the words, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market back to "normal"
One of London's most prominent property developers has said the housing market in the South East of England has "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital have been hotly contested and the subject of huge price rises, prompting the Bank of England to put a cap on mortgage lending in June amid widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chief executive of upmarket builder Berkeley, said on Monday that "since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from the 2013 peak," adding that this provided a "stable trading environment."
London's property market has performed well during the downturn as foreign buyers have flocked to the capital.
According to the Land Registry, prices in the borough have soared by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, far outstripping the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices at Berkeley's private, affordable and student offerings rose by about a fifth in the past year, to around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric surrounding a possible "mansion tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the Mortgage Market Review for April, which unveiled tougher lending rules, would also lead to slower market growth in both house sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in mortgage approvals in July, also suggesting the housing market is cooling.
Hamptons International, another property agency, revised down its forecast for house price growth in London in 2015 to 3 per cent, on the back of already weakening house price confidence.
Transaction volumes in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, have now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to estate agent WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire to own a home in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, with more than £2.2 billion in forward sales due.
Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations has remained stable and, as a result, forward sales have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent to £280m and turnover rose 18 per cent to £1.6bn.
In a statement on Monday ahead of the company's annual general meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's earnings this year were expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts are unanimously estimating annual pre-tax profit at £450m.
Berkeley shares were steady at £23.96 in afternoon London trading.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence released online by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence have been published online by a hacker who claimed to have a 'master list' of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative for the "The Tributes of Panem" star confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and accused the hacker of a "blatant invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been notified and will pursue anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a hole in Apple's online storage system iCloud. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not clear how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World," also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home - I hope you're really happy with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice, of Nickelodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were of her, tweeting "These so-called nude pictures of me are FAKE, folks.
Let's fight back right from the beginning. * pun intended *.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J."
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that was left standing in the rain.
Occasionally a woman would tell him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, aloof and perhaps a bit scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
Scratchy he knew.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this prickliness was a fledgling affair, which had been more promising than usual for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling, delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a damp but paradisiacal valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were still spiders in the baths, slugs had left their marks on all the windows, believing that all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deck chairs in the tall grass, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon. Absent-mindedly, both had clicked into the service console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer that his father had enjoyed listening to while shutters were closed in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their very own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolesced, just like the word obsolescent.
Common taste did what edicts and regulations would never have done, and just as people choose the dishwasher-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels for books, so they choose the ballads for music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailinn's big feet in a comical serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"That was a famous song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, putting two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game then, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew that was what was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz, even though it was not directly banned, was not played.
Improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed intellect.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints applied.
A compliant society meant that every element of that society gratefully agreed to the principle of group giftedness - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport because of their temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were naturally blessed with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a working service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly when WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED - for fear of being accused of stoking fires, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened labneh and shisha pipe restaurants, kept their heads down and became depressed with inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers to her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a bit weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's view.
All the world could see was her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"When you say it," she said without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deck chair, flipped the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in a storm.
"And your stubbornness is exactly why I feel perversely attracted to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as it broke on the shore.
The same confused men, still thicker-skinned and more exasperated after WHAT HAPPENED than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, marched from bar to bar, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Fat-headed?
They would have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They first smooch - smooch was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - first smooch and then hit.
According to Keverns, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the smooching itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt leaden, but the force of his grief took her by surprise.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him depart - just as her companion was watching him from an upstairs room - a man weighed down by something he had conjured up himself.
Adam is leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time she had seen anything like it before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, gave a short lecture on continued low and medium-level violence in the very parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, was most likely, given the money and energy invested in eradicating this violence.
"Much has been done, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the country's remote corners and valleys, where, historically, the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely been felt, despite the towering spires among the hedges.
But some traits turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the steeple, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
People cry when they hear sentimental ballads, get intoxicated with stories of difficulties overcome and claim to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former brutality hold rural communities and our urban fabric firmly in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious bickering at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again Esme invoked her right to privacy and refused to testify.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a prejudiced workplace.
We serve a prejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can occasionally distort results such as those you have presented.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "insidious" and "crude," might as well be interpreted by others as expressions of a natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to ride around on the WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of its essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED sign in flamingo pink repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country over the past quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, attend musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you are aiming for," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I am not saying anything other than that we are not yet healed as effectively as we fool ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED in the first place.
This time, however, it is not the others on whom we vent our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you call actions" mistakes "that our grandparents may or may not have made.
You also go too far when you say that they have vented their "anger" and "mistrust" of "others."
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others."
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - we agree on that.
And just as no debt needs to be assigned, so no debt needs to be repaid if such repayment were appropriate and if there was a way to repay it.
But what is the past for if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I may say something about that -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passersby described, had driven onto the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied plotting a coup to overthrow the government and said they were taking action against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reports of assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" who were about to be armed by police.
"What happened this morning was that the Defence Force of Lesotho staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were elements within the police who actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action gave the impression of a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have usurped the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces so far show signs of a coup d'etat," he said.
Spokesmen for the Lesotho military said Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is in charge during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has been targeted for trying to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions because of clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Eurozone output at a 13-month low
Eurozone output growth slowed to its lowest point in 13 months in August, according to a closely watched survey.
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders fell and factories slumped at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to come up with a clear plan for dealing with a sluggish eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation, with inflation at just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB head Mario Draghi could give further details later this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, similar to those undertaken by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"While small growth is better than no growth at all, the drag on manufacturers from rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties has become more pronounced," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a problem child, as is Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives are no longer working in the key industrial mechanism of Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, is also not reassuring, "Mr Dobson said.
The industry's decline is likely to stoke the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The best that can be said for August's eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index is that the sector continues to grow.'
He added: "Producers in the eurozone seem to be finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in what remain difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said it was "becoming more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to embark on some form of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege on the Beslan school that killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united East and West in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Their best hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine - and in which children like her are dying - will now come to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to clamber back into the shattered school gym
She was photographed by Russian celebrity photographer Dimitri Beliakov and shot to fame when she tried to climb back into the shattered school gym in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40.
Both were pronounced dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she considered herself completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another operation.
Some shrapnel is still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people like she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says pugnaciously.
'That's what happened to me and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
'I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a bit weaker each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back into school online, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help prevent it from happening again.
The boy who fled the hail of bullets thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said: 'Mum told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.'
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She told him, "Run."
Fearful that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who hugged his son outside, said: 'Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: 'I couldn't save her.'
In fact, Tamara had stumbled outside and ended up in hospital with leg injuries, believing her son had died.
After their reunion, she said: 'I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and gave me a hug.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to be given the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that my memory is fading.
I remember immediately afterwards throwing away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
'I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and they didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or are dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop, where I could choose anything I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who are suffering from the atrocities," said Damir, who was working as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children to call and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir liked to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: 'I always think this world hasn't got any better in 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just kids like ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not seeking revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember sometimes he would lie down on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so certain for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell all around me, with body parts all over the place.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could not possibly have survived this hell.
"I remember shouting to him," Damir, run, run away, "but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrific image became a symbol of the Beslan atrocities after the siege
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, pictured right today
His bloodied face was scarred by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day at school before rushing off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, so my little boy was left alone there for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer we get to that date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was long ago, I mean it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days haunt me all the time.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Haunting: The image of George (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been immortalised as a statue (right)
I remember that day George wanted to go to school so much. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of weeping George in San Marino.
Georgy does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand that, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain because of this image.
George said today: 'It's important that this can never happen again.
'I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People always investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of that Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is turning into something terrible.
'I can't understand how it's possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym as September 1 approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and am attending a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health would not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country but that won't happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym, sitting next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer but could not because of his health damage from the siege.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
'I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I actually felt a bit better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in that famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on his laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I was not able to study at the FSB's intelligence academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: 'I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the commemoration ceremonies.
I know George won't go.
It must have been a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God for giving it back to me. Here in Beslan, everyone is drawn by it.
It remains in us.
George is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He has had several surgeries, he can walk but he can't exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege and this only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families in which new children have been born, but also of widows who have never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want it to.
I will never forget how my heart leapt for joy when I saw him in hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The baby who was so poignantly carried to safety by a Special Operations Command
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is pulled to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no recollection of the atrocities
The world held its breath in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the siege of Beslan in the arms of a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty they kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then aged three, escaped, but Aliona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, who he has named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now 10, doesn't remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are a big happy family now and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of running over girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for assaulting a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the crossing at Pittenween in East Neuk.
Prosecutors say Mr Steward drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention, injuring the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set the trial for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available for less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for getting the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes that optimize the exposure time for dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our purchasing guide and ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams normally don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to watch it underwater, and the correct image setting is a matter of luck.
So take lots of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that takes a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions.

Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in an organisation as gigantic as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to saving sufferers both the agony of the disease and the agonies of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and illnesses, while those treated are predominantly preoccupied with something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I was struggling to get up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently blaming his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do it now than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and unreasonably worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pleura, the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is asbestos exposure - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has now been recognised as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged to stop using it.
Even where it was still in use, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another era, it hardly seems to be of any concern today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is at the height of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and likely future deaths in the UK
The reason we are now experiencing the deadly effects, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that mesothelioma takes decades to develop.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and often still is, present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we study and the shops in which we shop.
And so mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations, or age.
The privileged bastions, from fashionable department stores in London to private schools, are no refuge.
Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healing, sources of this deadly carcinogen have already been identified.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a plumber.
Indeed, he found it hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least part of this question.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma in the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one alive."
How many more of us will fall ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17 this year.
That was an unusually long period of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many more of us will fall ill?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to stall, a total of 90,000 people will have died from the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die like this.

A quick glance at the files of the courts, to which sufferers often turn for compensation, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is already.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations - one of which was its flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was just 18 when she started work at M & S.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I'd never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestos form," a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and WHO to be a "major health risk" with the potential for death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at its flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas with no known exposure were probably caused by work or in the home by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Much of this contact, he says, is due to the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people at the heart of government may have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibres of which could be stirred up by something as innocuous as "strong air movements."
MPs are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it seems the opposite is true.
While the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean bill of health," it is now beyond dispute that £1 billion of work will have to be spent over several years to refurbish Parliament, upgrade electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs are likely to meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches at Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not managed in accordance with the relevant regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to pinpoint contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital where asbestos claims were ruled positive," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45 and was having an operation late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pectoral membrane, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Baffled doctors took X-rays of his chest and inserted pleural catheters to extract fluid from his lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his symptoms went undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient of Abbott came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
Abbott's condition deteriorated again in September 2011 and his GP took his CT scans and X-rays to an expert panel.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between his rib cavity and chest cavity.
I'm an optimist.
I just keep going, "he says.
Honestly, I wasn't too worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was available in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a solicitor.
Only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who have been exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were more likely not to be exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that, for several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the doctors treating them.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people may have had their first exposure to asbestos in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemistry lessons, students have parked their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently mentioned on websites.
Meanwhile, innocent items in our homes, such as floor tiles and shed roofs, have been found to contain asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial poison that is present in large parts of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman concerned was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realised I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't be having another Christmas.
One of the greatest difficulties was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to absorb it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor," How long do I have left? "
And they gave me another 12 months or so.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibres are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pectoral membrane, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the epidermis and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem comes with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac thoracic surgeon who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Ironically, the very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also believed to have been exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "the breathing process pushes them to the edge of where the skin is.
It is inherently invasive from the outset.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some say it is worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"You can't cut out the pectoral membrane," he says.
They can't get around it with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "works" but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott got in touch with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counselling service for fellow sufferers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer centre," he cheerfully introduced himself on the phone.
"He was very positive," Abbott said.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and was expected to extend his life by just one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "put things in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiac thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a referral and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is critical for mesothelioma sufferers to get the best treatments available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers face another financial worry - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely hazardous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 "s was that it was recognized that even very low exposure posed a health risk.
And this is where corporate negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation," as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, following the inquest into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Indeed, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, attributing deadly asbestos exposure to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incident - is a huge problem.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is right for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there has been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced.
It has set up a £350million fund backed by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have had contact but cannot sue.
In these cases, the claimants receive 80 per cent of what a court could have awarded them in normal damages proceedings - around £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks £350m is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal by insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, the then Work and Pensions Secretary, also admitted the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan acknowledged that with seven deaths a day, swift action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act last December.
At that point Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial consultation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can give Lang-Lazdunski a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt empowered.
"That's obviously one of the most important things," Abbott said.
We see this again and again in patients.
There is something that makes you move on.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then, in March 2014, I had a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life threatening.
It's life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumours is visible.
But the process is very physically and psychologically exhausting.
You need to think about practical things - about money when I'm gone, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.
When you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I was first diagnosed, I told my girls that I had a disease that I wouldn't grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very gregarious and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not infused with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings grim certainty (as it does for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to vote in government, protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday, China's parliament decided against nominating candidates for the 2017 elections by Hong Kong's electorate, despite growing calls for democratic reform.
The move is likely to fuel long-heralded protests in Hong Kong's business district, with activists planning and mobilizing to do so within hours of the announcement.
The decision by the Chinese People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry," said Emily Lau, a legal expert who chairs the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
People have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, vice general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing public nominations in the elections would be too "messy" for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents vote for the government from 2017.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives Hong Kong's citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that China's leaders remain firmly in control of the process through a tightly controlled nominating committee.
Under a new clause, only candidates "with a love of the country and a love of Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer of some of Hong Kong's biggest and most high-profile protests in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong's government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered occupying the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and tightened security measures including police and barricades were in place outside the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is compounded by a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There are also growing fears that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central demonstrations as endangering business operations - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong is spiralling out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights involving 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's electorate.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to universities, where freshmen are offered appearances on a private plane.
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to carry their belongings around the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach university with the minimum of effort and luxury this year.
A company spokesman said no new bookings had yet been made as the service had only just been introduced, but added that "students will be booking the service in the coming weeks."
The company also said it expected a market for the service, despite tuition fees of £9,000 a year.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF can do just that.
However, the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch.
Megan Dunn, NUS vice-president for higher education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis as available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships fails to keep pace with soaring bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at university.
Feminists Criticize Race Issues and Police Behavior After Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. earlier this month.
Participants raised their hands in the air and chanted, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in white feminists "online discussions.
In her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
But as tensions rose in the Midwest and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that white women's responses revolved 100% around race.
Compared with black women's responses shortly after the August 9 shooting, personal essays with titles like "Thoughts on Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism isn't just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, it was an important change.
"I don't think you'll find many people in feminism who talk about being white and privilege in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to say something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women face every day but that are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural realm.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues neatly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women are now linking race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the motive was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be part of the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the divide between white and black women came to the point where white women campaigners for women's suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late nineteenth century and found that the fight for suffrage could succeed only for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and voting rights for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you are powerfully aware of why women of color do not trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - mirrors an era in which white feminists "caught" the issues that black women have been grappling with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
Prominent white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown to post a pointed article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll calling for more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand an inherent danger to the body - and opinions about race that are markedly different in public polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism that addresses both racial and gender issues, some of her comments on race in America are baffling.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson contrast with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there was an angry response from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem pushing itself to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is surfacing again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to revisit the issue as an essential women's issue, all she had to do was publish immigrant women's stories.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
'Pig house 'in Ipswich up for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by estate agents when it became clear it showed a large pig making itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached one-bedroom house, located on a private road in Ipswich, is on the market for £120,000.
Details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig laying its head on a sofa.
Estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was published in error and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom detached house."
Although the agent has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW town Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey has his turn this month
The search for a new millionaire in Perth's southwest continues, with one lucky winner scooping almost $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw.
A newsagent in Harvey hit the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to register.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the win was a talking point in the small town in Perth's south-west.
The city is talking about nothing else and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought such a win could happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated wins in the first division in the past month, a fitting end to a happy couple of weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of five millionaires in August after a Belmont couple made a mega $7.5 million profit just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and said the win allowed them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of WA's first division this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas begged in the gladiatorial arena
The gladiators were not the only ones standing ankle-deep in the mud at the first Roman Day in the amusement park in Rheinbach.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely enthralled by the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful array of presentations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Roman period and its significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis," who used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men successively into the ring for heroic duels in various gladiatorial genres.
First it was the turn of the "provocators" with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg splint on the left leg and arm splint on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and plant, as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm guard.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius," who attacked the "Secutor" with a throwing net, trident and dagger and after a short fight pushed the lad to the ground.
There the swords crashed metallic against each other, the shields rattled and the worms flew whirring through the arena, that one could fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, kept an ever-watchful eye on them.
"We wanted to revive everyday Roman life and bring the culture of the Roman era to life," Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal," explained the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park was transformed for one day into an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his welcoming speech.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this could also be marvelled at on Roman Day, such as the "Aqueduct Marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society contrasted water and energy supply then and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then."
This is also confirmed by surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments from the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
The footprints left by the wolf and the fox in the clay footsteps two millennia ago, before they were burned, are also impressive.
In 2011, the Office for the Preservation of Soil Monuments at the Rhineland Regional Office excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Industrial Park in Rheinbach.
Perimeter walls of a farm building with a kiln for drying grain and for malting were found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
According to Morscheiser, the villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germanic tribes in the then Roman Rhineland.
The children were also occupied with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's windmill game, or they wrote their names with metal pens on wax tablets, as the Roman pupils once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, craft glass mosaics at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach and operate a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the Naturzentrum Eifel Nettersheim in order to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
The visitors drove through the amusement park in a faithfully reconstructed Roman coach pulled by two cold-blooded horses, passing by the impressive stand of the Municipal High School, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks."
With a Roman Week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Rhineland-wide Roman Year 2014, which commemorates the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations as well as the Wachtberg Hiking Association, the Partnership Association and the Oberbachem Amateur Playgroup, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes will be offered and remind visitors of Wachtberg's Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will talk about his work on the drafty Wachtberg, plants will be presented as living monuments from Roman times, and a humorous lesson in international understanding will be offered between a group of Wachtberg "Teutons" and Romans who have moved in.
The Adendorf Primary School is dedicating a project week to the Roman theme.
The aim of the Roman Week is to make the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often no longer visible at first glance, tangible again.
In the Wachtberg town hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matron Sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola epidemic weighs on West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies keep their distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic has dealt a major blow to West Africa's economy.
The crops are rotting in the fields, the mines are deserted and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies are also already taking a step back.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," said Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second-largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola can enter the market.
Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 people killed here alone.
Recently, health officials said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign firms pull staff out
Across resource-rich countries, companies are suspending operations.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants are still leaving their hometowns to get supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is running out
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the West African economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore feels the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
On the markets, stocks of staples such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What is crucial is how far and for how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors can get the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease is also straining states' stretched budgets
The disease is also straining the already stretched budgets of the affected states.
Ratings agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely strained by high spending on health care and the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged $60 million (€45 million) to help the affected countries "health systems.
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where so far few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also falling significantly.
Gunners celebrate their 50th anniversary
The shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Schützenverein Tannenwald are in full swing from 12 to 14 September.
A big evening of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned on Friday, 12 September.
On Saturday at 18 clock is the big gun shooting.
Afterwards, the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" will take place in the large marquee.
Brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the grand procession at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the award ceremony of the Federal and Gauss Shooting.
The 25 ladies with their dirndls will be a particularly beautiful sight.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
The patronage is taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from the year 1907, when the society for "social entertainment by means of practice in carpenter and small-caliber shooting" was founded on 21 March.
The National Socialist regime had ordered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who launched the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau on 30 April in the Lukas inn.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as marksmen through a difficult initial period, in which it was primarily a matter of finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
Already in autumn 1965 the shooting club started with two teams in the round competitions in the inn "Leininger."
In the following years, the marksmen, who meanwhile were organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records tumbled every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active shooters has increased, so have the number of members.
After the club pub "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the board of directors at that time under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis."
After 2700 hours of work, Father Strasser gave the church's blessing for the new shooting range on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was surely the 44th Gauschießen, connected with the solemn consecration of the new riflemen's flag in July 1991.
On the 23rd and 24th of April 1994 the shooting club celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a group of thugs was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became Boellreferent.
A great challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the organization of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the association members modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought it up to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round-robin competitions
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently taking part in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sport pistol KK1, one youth team and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was promoted in the round 2013 / 14 from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the top 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has been promoted from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as jousting, carnival and royal ball, club excursions and Christmas celebrations have a tradition.
The archers are also present at the festivities in the parish and parish.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172, ending his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without speaking to reporters.
His team principal, Chad Johnston, said his team of 14 was disappointed but is now focusing on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we'd had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart crashed into a wall earlier in Sunday night's race after colliding with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went into today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed up and was ready to leave.
Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during an ash-filled race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to earn a spot in the Chase.
He returned to work while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who stepped onto the track during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart will face charges.
The three-time champion was greeted with huge applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart had moved into the top 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart on lap 122, Busch's
Car number 18 spun out of control after coming out of turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars crashing into the wall.
Stewart drove on, but fell back to 21st place.
Wanted dance-loving offspring
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to welcoming their team-mates.
Like many other associations, the Jazzgruppen in TV Jahn have to deal with all-day lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been decimated.
Now they are increasingly looking for offspring for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
There are only nine children left in the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits."
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be a lot more fun, "you could dance very different choreographies," she says.
If you feel like dancing, you can get a taste of the training session without obligation on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 and 6: 30 p.m. in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"Training starts regularly with a warm-up programme," says the coach.
Afterwards, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore and classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, conviviality is not neglected either.
"We sometimes go out to eat, watch dance movies and we have also stayed in the dance room," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dancing, you can also get a taste of one of the other offers on TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always get a taste of the lessons on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance / jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you fancy Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, drop by and join in.
Bulgarian Prison Wardens Protest Nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours, demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the prison workers "union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, the Director General for the Implementation of Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told BNR.
The protest by prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Association of Home Office Employees union.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
Pro-Russian fighters continue to advance in eastern Ukraine.
Today, Monday, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport in the rebel stronghold of Luhansk after heavy fighting, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions.
The army also said seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn personal consequences from his army's heavy defeats in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
Pro-Russian separatists say they have shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters again in the fight against Ukrainian government forces.
About 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian news agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coastguard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
Ukraine's border guard confirmed that two of its ships had come under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told broadcaster 112.u.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported taking control of several towns in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy from the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
Ahead of the event, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demands.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia with its planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
But the NATO chief accused Russia of "a flagrant breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side "show that they regard us as adversaries."
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen also announced plans to increase NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "readiness action plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have a more visible NATO presence in the east for as long as necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have reportedly agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Ukraine has been without fuel from Russia for weeks because of the dispute over the price of gas.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says toll will be "very clear"
Now the Chancellor is making a clear commitment to this once again.
But it is not a carte blanche for all the complicated details.
Persistent reservations from the CDU against the car toll have visibly gripped the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for the introduction of a car toll after persistent opposition from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
"Let me be clear: it is in the coalition agreement and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of top CDU bodies in Berlin.
Merkel, however, did not commit herself to a detailed model for the time being.
"Certain parameters" are set out in the government's programme.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) had "made a proposal, and work is now continuing on that."
The North Rhine-Westphalia-CDU, however, insists on its no to tolls on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also contributing constructively to the discussions on a bill.
Beyond the topic, he also discussed with Dobrindt further possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, saying that his house was examining its own concept to compensate motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the minister in charge in the cabinet.
CDU federal vice president Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads would be subject to tolls," said the CDU regional chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will talk about the issue again.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU regional associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The reason for this is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic with neighbouring states.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from within the CDU ranks.
The left regards the plans as a failure in view of the dispute within the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, however, domestic car owners may not be charged extra.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the vehicle tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers on the grounds of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she was going to die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers spent most of her youth believing that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
Indeed, she suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsteady gait and curved toes.
Sufferers also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA) - a disease with a very poor chance of survival.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother-of-two, who is now 51, said: 'As a child I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I kept falling down and it all took me longer.
I could never roller-skate or skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from the disease.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between I was going to lose all my skills.
I did it all on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she turned 17, she realized that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined, and consulted her doctor.
He just stood up and gave me a hug and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Retired Staff Sergeant Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former military training ground
There has been no shooting at the former military training ground in Münsingen for almost ten years.
Nevertheless, deadly munitions still appear every month in the heart of the Swabian Jura biosphere region.
The shells are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere during the blasts.
In December 2004 the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military service.
Since then, the 6500 hectare site has been the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on Washington-area businessmen rises as economy recovers
An economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local business tax filings rose slightly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly released study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden on corporations rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third straight year of growth after several years of declining payments in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by Ernst & Young and the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from businesses.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax receipts, at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate real estate values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of those gains came from big states like California, New York, and Texas, the pattern seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in Maryland in raising state and local tax revenues, where property taxes account for just over one-fifth of corporate tax filings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a lot of real estate, especially in the D.C. tax area, is owned either by the government or by nonprofits that don't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to provide the same services that other states provide.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the housing market.
Corporate revenues also appear to be recovering, the data showed.
Businesses in the region reported income taxes at state agencies of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising evenly in all three places.
The District's rate of increase was 4.3 percent, in line with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was much higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower-than-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three areas of government, at 6 percent (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent in Maryland and a comparatively high 9.975 percent in the District.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local business taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the District.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina passed legislation to cut its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, the law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - a transitional structure under which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland, and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than overall corporate taxes.
The researchers say the trend and increase in business taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in overall VAT receipts for state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cuts have an impact on the region's labor market.
Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin city in China now wants a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's twin city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would establish itself in our city," said the vice party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during a visit to his city by an SPD delegation.
In the course of the conversation, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party repeatedly returned to this concern of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also called a canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, Li said.
That is why people have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, leader of the Hessian Social Democratic Party (SPD), who led the German delegation of politicians, assured the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much to make beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added over lunch with party leaders in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already radiates this joie de vivre, he flattered the host.
The official from Guangzhou then toasted with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Chairman Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but canceled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," said the local politician.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow."
Currently, travelers have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert on Germany, nodded in agreement.
Cultivated partnership
The affable vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only took office this year after his predecessor was ousted on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being cracked down on by leader Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where carmaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially established more than a dozen town twinning partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometres away, is one of those that is maintained by both sides, for example with a school exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
It aims to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros next year, Li said.
Joan Rivers' family 'keeping their fingers crossed'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We are all keeping our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after suffering an emergency cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, according to sources.
Doctors are deliberately keeping her sedated and under close observation until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains described as "serious."
The response came from many quarters, including overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners placed on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which buyers can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the appliance at a glance.
New cars are subject to stricter nitrogen oxide levels in the "Euro 6" emission category.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $US1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion dollars was a done deal, and the collaboration seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to showcase their bravado in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to one insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which those who know better give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theatre, is already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't materialize, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another mystery, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
It is hard for snobs like me, who declare that they would rather play sport than watch, to grasp the attraction of watching others play rather than take control of their own destiny.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3am while she's sneaking through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a prankster get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could be watching all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games, so watching without your own eye-view control can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-paced games in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless there's a playful or humorous virtuoso in it, his Twitch channel probably isn't that interesting.
But what do sceptics like me know?
Twitch is viewed by 55 million unique visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube could have simply swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men being wooed as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - gulp - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the bouncy castle at the castle garden party on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy downpour on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident in the early hours of Saturday, when the first visitors set off for the open air.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedel residents, as well as guests from the surrounding area, had made themselves comfortable around the supply booths on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, bobbing their feet to the beat, enjoying cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day.
And across the generations.
While some lounged on blankets on the specially carted white sand at the beach bar, others feasted on a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the younger guests.
In the truest sense of the word, the volunteers also had their hands full when it came to applying make-up to children, in order to cope with the crush and conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
The older ones used the football tables or took part in a skateboard workshop organised by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30pm, it slammed into the crowd, with families in particular looking for shelter.
But this did not detract from the attractiveness of the festival.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the board."
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on, Sem made it clear to the Volksstimme in an initial assessment on Sunday.
He described as annoying the fact that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently the security company had been booked with too little effort.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the premises.
The response has been very good.
In a first conservative estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors cavorting in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound engineering.
The Salzwedel-based hip-hop band Blocks'n'Rox therefore cancelled their performance, unnerved.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a puncture.
"But next year they will be there," he said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful in terms of the number of visitors.
And this in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but which will have to be rectified in the second edition.
Organisers have also faced criticism on the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you simply expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event website.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a little bit," Ele Zimmermann says at the same point.
Others don't see the initial problems quite so narrowly.
I find it very good that some people not only talk stupid, but also really try to set things up.
Hats off! "wrote Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
The organisers now have a year to address these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's Landmark Shrinks
Predictably, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-laid component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is part of a larger project: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA space observation radar, the hull, the so-called radon, is being completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 metres, the new radon will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is to replace the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is cut off and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
Provided the weather plays its part, the action is due to take place at the start of this week.
Ice Bucket Challenge contestant dislocates jaw
Isabelle Roberts, from the UK, screamed so much when ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully awry.
A woman has been hospitalised after screaming so much during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts, from the UK, screamed so much when ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the structure of her face.
'The water was so cold I was screaming and while I was doing it my jaw just stopped, 'she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work, my jaw was hooked, and then I realised something was wrong.
My mum and sister saw it too and almost burst into laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was taken to hospital to have her jaw dislocated after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has become an internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull together again?
Recently there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshausen castle associations.
Now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.
The late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshausen Castle Friends, cited the project in Guédelon, France, as a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshausen Castle.
Only a year ago there was no good climate between the castle club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
Until now, the points of view on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshausen Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be markedly different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks are to be held soon on a joint approach.
This is confirmed by Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down," says Sjöberg.
In his opinion, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
That way, visible successes could be achieved more quickly.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had their eye on the reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest until the very end, the castle association around Sjöberg focuses on the "development and experience" of the site.
Herbert Piffl, vice chairman of the Burgfreunde, said he was delighted with the call.
Since Dimbleby's death, he has presided over friends of the castle.
A new chairman is to be found at a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"Following the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially suspended the activities of the association out of respect." This "period of reflection" was necessary to "consider how to proceed."
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then enter into talks with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also get an up-to-date picture of the mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will be found." He himself does not want to stand because he lives in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
But Tölzer said he would "very much like to continue working on the project."
The different points of view on reconstruction are likely to persist in the near future in Piffl's eyes.
He pays tribute to Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a castle in the air.
Due to a high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was sceptical at the beginning, too.
But in the course of time I have come more and more to the conviction that it makes sense to advance the project. "A" unique selling point "could be created for the rafting city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, Piffl believes that the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
"Personally, therefore, I do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the castle club will perhaps make some progress on this point.
Their goal of first documenting history "is important and good."
After that, we could go on.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of college textbooks is more than $1,000 a year for many students, sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board said students spend an average of more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and materials, but there are various cost containment options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly lower price than when they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that textbook rentals had doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, said Neebo's vice president, Tevor Meyer.
Fewer than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the lowdown on the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only a third of the price available online at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind the notes of others or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is available on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book sold for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous editions were permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.

Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and do not want to keep them after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the terms and conditions of the shop where you rent, including the penalty charges that may be incurred for writing notes, underlining or traces of use.
Tenants beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a specified period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for book pricing, as it can help you find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, Gault says, you should check whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that took four weeks to deliver and eventually paid full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a box office hit
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" grossed less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed just $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz-themed film "Sex Tape" grossed just $14.6 million on its opening weekend, while children's films like "Taming of the Dragon 2" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children's films may be the reason.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" ever for children's movies and described "Taming of the Dragon 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
With films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer film release that was shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema-goers and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are of equal value to those of last year.
Some commentators say the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website: 'I think times are changing.'
We have to accept that and not try to chase the past.
In contrast to the current weak box office results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated $1.2 billion in revenue from streaming content, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comic book adaptations, predicting a Hollywood "meltdown."
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, with potential blockbusters expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, others in the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply "cyclical," telling The Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the box office, and no one will worry about business anymore."
When the 2nd district table tennis class was abolished a few years ago for the purpose of streamlining the division of the leagues, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to its program.
The consequence: those who have not ascended have descended.
Gothenburg's top-flight team Torpedo have avoided relegation in the Bundesliga, but will only play fifth-tier next season.
Torpedoes women remain fourth-class, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve compete in the new association league, there are no more clubs from Göttingen in the national league.
In the women's division, TTV Geismar plays in the association league, Torpedo second in the regional league.
What looks like a better district class in terms of composition is now the new Southern District League.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC will compete here.
In the regional league Dransfeld and SC Weende are playing, in the regional class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The regional upper league of the women starts at least at target strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen will start in the city centre.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends its girls to the small town.
Also the squadron of the SCW boys - Torpedo II starts there - is not complete.
Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV start the season in a district class.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen district leagues start with nine teams each.
In the West-relay are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Among others, Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the east relay.
The women's team consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at county level.
Remarkable, that none of the six 2.Kreisklasse reached target strength, here the innovative and bustling circle executive committee will have to think already once.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
Hundreds gathered in Newport city centre on Saturday for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered outside Cardiff city hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend, speaking to protesters who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenager flown out of Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers have been winched to safety after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man set off for their tour at Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after noon on Sunday.
Concerned relatives called police at about 8pm when the pair failed to return home.
A search team of local police and emergency services set out and the pair were found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 11pm.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescue workers stayed with the couple overnight and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The 1,000 or so protesters were forced out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The station had resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said protesters armed with sticks had damaged equipment in the newsroom.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about 3,000 protesters clashed with security forces again on Monday about a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
A police officer was injured, according to hospital sources.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend when protesters tried to enter Sharif's residence.
They are demanding the resignation of the prime minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday evening after a meeting at army headquarters, "without wasting time and without using force."
The statement added: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has raised concerns about intervention by the military, which has staged more coups in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been going on since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri made similar comments.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning last May's parliamentary election by fraud.
Qadri is calling for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
Protesters had initially remained peaceful outside parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer into third place in the standings after his second win of the season.
A bitter week for Rapid came to a conciliatory end on Sunday with the 2-0 victory over Grödig.
"The win is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team reached an interim low with the Europa League exit on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalscorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
Schrammel's dream goal puts Rapid on the road to victory Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with its second win of the season and goes into the international break with a feeling of success.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his superb volley from the sixteenth minute.
'I thought I'd put all the frustration of Thursday behind me and put it under the crossbar, 'said the 26-year-old with a smile.
When Schrammel scored for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"This is something very special for me, I'm from Rapid," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvis injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did a very good job there as well.
He has enough experience to be able to play in that position.
He deserved the goal, he has already made some assists this year, "praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2-0 by Hofmann after just over an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could have written in.
"Thank God we were a bit lucky today," Schrammel also commented, alluding to the discrepancy between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results were not right, but the playfulness was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even said that they had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."
The first three-point since July 26 thus proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that it has character."
No less gratifying for him: "That we finally played to zero again."
A lot of work during the international break The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger all had to retire, while Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger all made their debuts, made the win even more valuable.
"We must not forget that," warned Barisic, who in the past three days lost players with Behrendt and Pavelic, "who have been very stable lately."
The international break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and gain a bit of physical strength," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One man who probably finds the break particularly convenient is Captain Hofmann.
He tears up for the team, passes over pain.
Especially in this difficult period he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the Rapids the structure before substituting in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, playing his 350th Bundesliga game, it was his first goal out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4-2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Must not believe that everything is good now." "We have certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time, "Hofmann said.
But he urged concentrated work: "You can't always see it in black and white.
We haven't played as badly as we have in recent weeks.
However, we must not believe that all is well now.
He could not deny the importance of his role to the team.
It is a very young team and I can help them a lot at the moment.
They do stick with me at certain stages, "Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-goal "out of the category magic goal," as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only criticism I can make of the team is that in some phases we were not specific enough in terms of scoring goals.
Since we have had too few degrees.
Central defender Maximilian Karner took a similar view: "It started off badly, but then we found our way in and even scored a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
Under this treetop there is rest
We showed a mighty tribe during our puzzle task of the summer series "My Piece of Rhoen Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these giant trees still exist in the district, the example shown is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
We pass paddocks, basalt stone piles and seas of basalt stone.
A bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it is.
The natural monument looks vital, it towers above the other trees in the area and with a circumference of more than eight meters reminds of an American sequoia.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider specifically consulted the Bischofsheim archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what the reason was for the scourge.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago, the goat herders drove their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the painstakingly cleared and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers exhausted by the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because herds of goats are actually grazing on the meadows again.
The area has also been declared a core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider added.
One should, however, exercise caution when entering the stone-accumulations, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular abode for vipers.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, which ascend towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the moated castle?
A moated castle, which is looked for with our next task, is however rather seldom to be found in the height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building portrait could fit.
Where is our "Piece of Rhön Happiness" located?
My Piece of Rhoen Happiness
As with previous series of Main-Post in previous years, there are prizes up for grabs this year, if they have the right solution.
If you like to take pictures yourself, you can also take part.
You can send us the solution as well as your very personal "Piece of Rhön Happiness" with this keyword under the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainǐ.
The best photos will be published.
After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's prime minister and current EU president, Matteo Renzi, pushed through the nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of EU foreign policy, to succeed Britain's Catherine Ashton, in the face of strong conservative opposition at last week's special EU summit.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reports, sees the appointment of Mogherini, who is also seen as a favorite on his governing team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects it to give a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that this will also calm down the leftist party base, which has repeatedly rebelled against him, because Mogherini is associated with it - albeit in a more moderate way.
According to the prevailing opinion in Rome, a political reconciliation will be achieved with the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the Polish nominee for President of the Council.
The EU's chief diplomat will also become a deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has held senior party posts for nearly two decades and is known for her ambition, will rise to the "enormous challenges."
Born in Rome, she is married and has two daughters.
The political scientist, who holds a doctorate in political science, began her party career in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita in 2008 to form what is now the Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became vice president of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election to the Party Council of the Left Democrats in 2001, she entered high party politics and worked in the Foreign Policy Department, of which she soon became head.
She occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on the NATO mission in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, and maintained contacts with the social democrats in Europe and with the democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's more than 40% vote in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini will have a part to play, as is noted in PD circles.
The PD counters the accusations in Brussels that the new EU High Representative has too little diplomatic experience and therefore lacks substance.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltic states, Mogherini's approach to the crisis in Ukraine is mistrustfully realistic and defamed as a "pro-Russia course."
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gazprom, which will transport Russian gas directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which will also serve to secure Italy's energy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos of her shaking hands with Putin were met with outrage in Brussels, as was her invitation to the Kremlin chief to attend an economic summit in Milan in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is a trainee who has already completed another apprenticeship at the company.
In future, the new employees will work in four apprenticeships: electronics technicians (three apprentices), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the Schwandorf district: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended secondary and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages and instructors travel to Oberammergau for a team-building event, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn River are on the program.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices spread over all classes is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's key ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said to loud applause.
In a soothing gesture, the prime minister insisted his government would not challenge France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite fierce calls for it to be relaxed by Emmanuel Macron, the country's new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show "unity" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw a spanner in the works by appearing at a meeting of renegade Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for "depriving the French of faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists "constant trench warfare, saying that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either; they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive autumn or winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
Repeating her party's call for parliament to be dissolved, she said she was confident she would emerge victorious in early elections and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered defeat in local elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was ahead in May's EU elections.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is in danger of splitting into several rival factions before Hollande's term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise close to a $3bn deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is in advanced negotiations to acquire rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry insiders.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele, while it competes with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end in failure.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives for Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years as the middle class strengthens in emerging markets such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise operators.
Prestige Cruises filed for an IPO with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise in its current form was formed in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held a 28 percent stake in the company at the end of June, Apollo a 20 percent stake and private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake, according to regulatory filings.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together hold 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original Prestige Cruises IPO filing.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the vote.
A group loyal to Beijing waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates to run in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership election.
All candidates must first garner the majority support of a nominating committee, which is expected to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to stand for election, prompting pro-democracy activists to carry out their threat to cripple Hong Kong's financial center with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication in June of a Beijing white paper outlining China's dominance of Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the election process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching to the city's business district and organizing a sit-in.
Li's questioning is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and Vice Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were to be questioned during the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside the leadership's office in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not include any democratic elements until the end of Hong Kong's 150-year colonial rule.
Putin urges Kiev to start 'statehood talks' with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-à-vis Ukraine must be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call for Kiev's government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he seems to have pursued since the riots began five months ago: helping the separatists seize territory and pressuring Ukraine's government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned Ukraine's military campaign to recapture separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the captured territory as "Novorossiya" or "Novorossiya," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are hoping for early peace talks as Ukrainian politicians campaign for elections on Oct. 26 and as government groups attack civilian communities in separatist-held areas are "trapped in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-east Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by Kiev's leaders, to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to its outright annexation of Crimea, where the majority of its 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, because most of its 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and pre-conflict polls showed a broad majority in favor of remaining in Ukraine.
Autonomy, raised by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control of an area linking Russian territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of Russia's navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The region between the Rostov region of Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his inauguration speech on 7 June, suggested that, after new elections, Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the constitution that would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy appears to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whom Moscow accuses of arming and inciting.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing came after another rebel advance last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine through the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists seized control of Novoazovsk in a coup that Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to seize the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
As a result, massive civil and military preparations are underway to fortify Mariupol, a steel port of 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are at a point where there is no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine's territory.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which are to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian columns of tanks and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the beleaguered separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first, believed to be 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian incursion into Ilovaysk, were swapped on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal involving Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten has made no secret of his anger at hackers who are believed to have stolen nude pictures of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood A-listers.
The movie town is in uproar after a series of explicit photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence surfaced online in a celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible is believed to have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tribute of Panem," and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko, from Melbourne, have also reportedly made private photos public due to an iCloud breach.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: 'It's disgusting.'
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, who is currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected "felt violated."
The hacker is believed to have 30 images of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying topless in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning were unavailable for comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ: 'It's a heinous invasion of privacy.'
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: 'Posting hacked images from a cellphone is no different than selling stolen goods.'
Legally speaking, the distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers took part yesterday in the 8th Cycling on the Großer Feldberg and thus supported the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Help for Children with Cancer).
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, was an easy training for others.
But there was one thing everyone agreed on: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery yesterday cycled up the Feldberg.
For a good cause.
He can easily put away the little sore muscle, especially since the participation in the 8th Cycling on the Grosser Feldberg for the benefit of the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Help for Children with Cancer) (Frankfurt) also brought him personally a valuable insight.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - great!"
Little pause on the applause curve?
Nope, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits in the Oberursel city parliament on behalf of the CDU, many of the 718 participants struggled to get up in the early morning dew yesterday and came close to exhaustion but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the eleven-kilometre stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green politician from the district council, who appeared in all red - red dress, red bike - made a bit of an understatement at the start ("Lots of professionals, there's the finish!"), but then he proved himself to be half a professional on the mountain and crossed the finish line after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He also completed the course in one go, as did Nina Kuhn, press officer of the town of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg biking" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we would love to be part of it - we would have taken a ride today anyway," says Kuhn.
Along the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down to Oberursel in the morning, only to pedal up again shortly afterwards.
Florian Zierz, from Frankfurt, got into the saddle at 9 a.m., "did" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with a lot of fun.
"Fries-Toni" also had fun.
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had set his sights on 40 minutes on his 6.5 kilo road bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be part of it, "Andreas Balzke said.
The well-trained Mainz rider says that he is an "ambitious road cyclist."
And he has to be, because he was on the "fixie bike," which are also racing bikes, but without gears...
Not only the 20 hikers, who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, proved that it was easy to climb without a bike, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Mountain rescue doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who and his team, equipped with a four-wheel-drive bully and quad bike, ensured safety, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled track, but he just pulls the sled himself." So the man is in a way his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - were sent out on the course in groups in the morning.
The walkers first arrived at 9.30am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Cycling on the Großer Feldberg," gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to close the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
