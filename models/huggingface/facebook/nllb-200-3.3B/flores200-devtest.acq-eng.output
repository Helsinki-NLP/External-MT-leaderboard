There appears to be an experimental vaccine that could reduce Ebola mortality, but no suitable treatments have yet been developed to treat the existing infection.
Its combination with one of the antibodies, ZMapp, was initially promising in this field, but official studies showed that the benefits of this combination were less than the benefits of preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as the control standard, meaning that the scientists used it as the reference and compared the other three treatments.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a common theory of correctness, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on the upper side and pale or carotenoid-colored on the lower side.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a complete evolutionary skeleton, called a "spine", but do have secondary feather characteristics - such as protrusions and micro-protrusions - researchers have concluded that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development of these secondary characteristics.
The brown of the wings suggests that they were not used in aviation but only for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggest that although this nocturnal was a small dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage with no dorsal fin.
The researchers noted that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows a bird feather rather than a plumage.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty others.

Just as the Moon's pull on the Earth causes tides to form, the Milky Way also attracts the Milky Way.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way as natural matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy lies in a halo-like environment, composed of small particles in large numbers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters would lock themselves in a booth, and put a preprinted piece of paper indicating their preferred candidate in a casket.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box, and signs it on the voters list.
French electoral law regulates the procedure with unfavourable rigour.

Candidates may send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under intensive supervision following specific procedures.

"We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop", said Deputy Inspector-General D. K. Arya.
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambhu Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car struck it, none of them was conscious.
But the driver suffered serious head injuries.
They temporarily blocked the road where the collision occurred and in the meantime the emergency services released the driver of a red Audi TT.
He had initially been taken to James Baggett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the sheriff court in Edinburgh on charges of murdering her son.
He is in custody and awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness is highly doubtful since his photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in Britain but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have recognised that the publication of the photographs could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "It seems to me that journalists are certainly going in a dangerous direction for publishing photographs or images of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has advised journalists that there will be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which divides Palestine based on the pre-1967 war borders of the Middle East.
Other topics that were reported to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the question of the West Bank.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in Ghor for ten years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a continuous presence for only five years.
The sentinel guards were to strictly supervise the shooters in the supplemental pest control experiment, as the experiment was being monitored and their effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Sporting Archery Association, qualified volunteers were selected under the Association's Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Program, the four hunters selected for the first hunt received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by a new nine-member provisional electoral council.
This is the fifth Martelli by-election in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, occurred over the failure to hold elections due by 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of hacking, which the company termed "non-fatal".
The ministry responded to Apple's call for a delay in the report as "very unfortunate".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm Greenwich).
The North Mariana County Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami wave potential.
A former Filipino policeman has taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly persons, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographer later took the place of an old woman because she needed a shower. Mendoza was shot.
Leggens followed in his father's footsteps and chose medicine as a career.
He trained as a gynaecologist and then started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Leggans began investigating preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research has shown that when given hormones it accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders or what it called " black boxes " on Thursday.
I also praised my fellow wrestlers for their color.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first mistress, Luna, died on a full moon night. A strong woman, there is no one like her".
Dustin " The Goldsmith " Runnels commented: "Luna was as eccentric as I am... and perhaps more so than I am... I love her and miss her... I wish she were in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view was shared by 34% of respondents, who wished that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
Concerning the opposite side of the question, 29% of those surveyed thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should not be a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness was called into question because of his fatigue, as he was supposed to swim the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He could not take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because the use of these medications is prohibited in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number ever known on January 25.
Several people made the discovery using various devices and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth as well as organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets, and especially the Earth, were formed when comets collided with Earth in the distant past.
Comey, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumours "political gibberish and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NEXGEN is a system that the FAA says allows aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology as opposed to the older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow aerial observers to pinpoint the location of an aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport and no underground train stops at Wembley, as well as no car parks and no underground parking facilities.
Concerns over lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will have to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's fans.
I cited a study published Thursday in the journal Science about the emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although this process was previously thought to be much longer - due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's bird, the medium-sized ground squirrel, the migratory cactus, and the sharp-tailed ground squirrel.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be wrapped in small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be rolled up and out. It can also be tapped or rolled into a paper form.
It could be made very thin, and glued to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "luminous manuscripts".
They call it the chemical's H-value number, and you can make an index for that number using red clover juice.
The color of the cupping juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The level of hydrogen ions is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that lack electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Roll the two dry powders together and then gently rinse them with a clean wash until they are ball-shaped.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this will make you feel a strange sensation and form a kind of covering.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with flush toilets in almost every house and connected by an advanced sanitary sewer system.
Remnants of sanitation systems have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.In Roman civilization, the baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would go together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back at approximately the same time.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
It would take a giant rocket over 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the shape of the world dramatically; but it remains the most important contribution to us in providing a faster and easier means of transportation.
We have the train, the car, and a lot of secondhand transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits, deer and deer.
Finally, many small mammals (including stray domestic cats) eat the most numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of animals and live in large groups called lions.
A lions family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Females tend to be closer to each other, having a larger family of sisters and daughters.
The lion herd acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly the animals are similar to lions (but not other large mammals) in behavior and are very lethal to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group as the lion, the panther, and the leopard. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's roar, but it is closer to a furious roar.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if you like. Almost all the animals that the pygmy leopard hunts are smaller in size.
Scientists believe that the salamand tracks and finds prey by means of its sense of smell; it smells where they have been on the ground.
They can see well enough with night vision, and their wings also move. The pygmy leopard hunts its prey by mating with its surroundings and then attacking them.
When a small population of organisms (a small population) separates from its main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different attributes or adaptive methods to become a stronger competitor than it had previously.
The original inhabitants have not been changed at all, so they still require the same methods of adaptation as we have known them.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other populations gradually diminishes.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will have diverged so much that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. The origin of a species is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans produce (i.e. exhale).
The plants of the garden receive their rightful share of the sunlight through the construction of lighthouses. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants too. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The monk was the dominant predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except other monkeys.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 claw-like teeth and a second set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything to get in its way.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a complex tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and second mosasaurs, and he may have been a carnivore.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not match it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of exotic or unusual festive items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a louse.
A second difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on benches, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that were introduced into Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods and it was considered the home of the god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods during festivals and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a secure room which only priests can enter.
Unique pyramidal towers called zigguras were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for God.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, houses were of little importance.
Most Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the square; shops were open tables overlooking the street. Stones were used in the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland has been populated by humans sporadically. In the Norse epics, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, though each nation was Scandinavian.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The reverse of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known with certainty, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches √ó 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was in its earliest existence in a folded storage.
So, it is likely that the code was simply added as a filename.
The landings on the day of the battle and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
France was ruled by the Vichy. These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an operation that came to be known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France, and they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a cooperative, community-like manner.
The word civilization originates from the Latin civilis, meaning civilized, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and is also determined by the way social structure is formed.
Autonomous cities are like the forefathers of nations.Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Micro-cultures very often disappear without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government - of which Congress was the sole element - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax, and in the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, relied on the state authorities, which were generally uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, you do not have the authority to override interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended and the states so disparaged the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful national team in the world and were World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the archipelago of islands that Japan occupies, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipelago".
Taiwan began to be rediscovered in the 15th century when European sailors sailing around recorded the island as lha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change the native grain production and employ Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu has three main buildings, namely the Intihuana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered and restoration work continues today.
For example, the world's most common still-photo format is 35 mm, the size of film that dominated at the end of the analogue film era.
Its production continues to this day, but most importantly, the form of the image sensor in digital cameras has inherited the image aspect ratio to its height.
The 35 mm model is actually, slightly convoluted, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this image is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the simplest integer) therefore 3: 2.
Many popular formulas (the Advanced Photographic System group, for example) equate or approximate this ratio of width to height.
The oft-misused and often-ridiculated rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in the system in a transparent form.
Remember that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the picture into three vertical and horizontal segments (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound the European countries together for over a millennium despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power I possessed affected everyone from the king to the parish.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used for the relief of suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash funds exist specifically for this purpose.
It was the central authority of the Church in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the requirements of the Creed had been met.
Britain was soon surrounded by Germany by sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy has proven effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade is in violation of generally accepted international law which has been codified and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has imposed restrictions on international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even ships that have already entered the war.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Pachelhorn (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's phases or each ruling dynasty was of a different type.
In addition, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each ruling dynasty.One of the most notable of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods a fierce war was fought between many nobles seeking the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the most bloody periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died in battles for the top places in the Great Hall of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to the ruler alone.
After the Revolution, careers were open to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, military classifications are now based on pay.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to unleash their revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad was intensely interested in things beyond this world. He used to frequent the Gar which became known as 'Hera' on the mountain of 'The Light' for meditation.
The Gar itself, which has survived through the ages, offers a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find it even if you know where it is. Once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World to have survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is one of a series of massive pyramids built to house the tombs of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Cemetery City of Giza" of the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), sub-tombs, temples, and the Altar of the Dead.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and other members of his family.
The "upward" sign is in the shape of a V and the "downward" sign is in the shape of a triangle or a square without the lower side.
A high mark indicates that you should start at the edge and push the bow, while a low mark means that you should start at the end of the bow (where your hand grips the bow) and pull it down.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more toned.
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, and just remember that the printed curve markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected in general.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Mary-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of women merchants.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a huge crowd of people shouting and cheering against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their cars on their way out.
One of the gang members once beheaded a royal guard delegate killed in Versailles in front of a horrified queen.
The Filipino people have borne the brunt of the United States of America's imperialist war in the Philippines.
Dholo was forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system in order to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the main gains of American imperialism.
We must understand the context of the motivation for the creation of the organisation, in order to understand the Templars.
The period during which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages and covers the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, ending in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the impetus of technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are shared by most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on communities that are integral to, rather than correlated with, society.
For example, one might say that the car engine must have road maintenance.
However, establishing a nationwide road network is not economically viable if there are few cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Car ownership in the mass also leads to higher rate of road accidents, which leads to new technologies in healthcare to treat affected people.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Weisch and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and culture related to that geography developed, and these, as they were consistent with the place of society, were better than the imposed rules.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth much more than the Byzantine markets brought.
It was at this time that Paris, rather than Constantinople, was dubbed the capital of fashion.
The Gothic style reached its zenith sometime between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on clothing.
However, due to slow communication channels, trends in the West may be delayed by as much as 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments at the time was the outcome of the Crusades, when people began using rice to bind clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture cultivated to produce enough food for the individual farmer and his family to eat.
Subsistence agriculture - often without fertilizer or poisons - is a simple system that uses stored seeds adapted to the ecosystem of the area, in addition to a method of crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Most farmers have historically been subsistence farmers, and this tradition is alive in many developing countries.
Subcultures facilitate the matching of like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The traits that define a subculture's distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their own membership by various symbolic uses of the style including dress, costumes, and terminology.
Among the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the reliance on a few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, social disconnection from adults during their development.
Some homeless children have been incarcerated by persons (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child has been due to the parents' refusal to allow the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have been abused as children or severely traumatized before they are abandoned or flee.
Others say they were raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, the behavior of a feral child (within physical limits) is very similar to that of a pet, such as fearful or indifferent of humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a helpful tool that provides support for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new venture.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, and in a second form, a tutor is a form of interactive learning, as well as a paper clerk in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the programme and aims to ask questions, stimulate and explain actions that a student might not be able to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not promote nurturing and education, but they do.
We understand that the alternative care system is a safe haven for the uneducated.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The substitute caregiver must provide all the necessities that were missing in the homes they moved from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The characteristics of the Internet bring about additional dimensions in terms of usage and content.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by E. M. and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction on websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting precise facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a fraction of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can discover whether a person is lying by interpreting exact expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks in his paper noted that the President's Speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It also suggests that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared by some animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has demonstrated the existence of two groups of Chinese varieties: a subtle group and a visible second group.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection results from the accumulation of expression variation.
The separation and reconstitution processes make random variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system similar to humans have difficulty obtaining their amino acids from available plant resources.
Failure to do so would lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most abundant plant resources were proteins that we could obtain from the leaves and pulses, but these proteins would be difficult for primates like us to digest if they were not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, and ants) are not only easily digested, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that is similar to the way chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep apnea is characterized by the deliberate withdrawal of sleep during your normal sleep period and the re-appearance of sleep after a brief period (10 to 60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to stop it.
The second option, based on biosystems, involves drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and spirit.
If stress is reduced, the positive is increased which gives life power. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing holding us back from achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been influenced by the MahƒÅyƒÅna-road of love and other techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everyone.
The energy of Kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures and breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with Kundalini yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god Yuga. Through the visualization of various gods, they purify energy channels, activate the chakras, and create the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and the Soviet Union and the United States of America suffered as a result, but with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was to last for the next forty years, and the fighting would be on the ground, by proxy armies, in theaters of war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed from the right, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and formed the Byelorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the function of the navy has been to ensure that your country can transport its own people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting the ability of your enemy to transport his.
A notable modern example is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion with its submarine-based weaponry.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have invaded Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
The goat appears to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to be preserved because milk, wool, meat and leather were easily accessible.
Domestic goats were generally reared in roaming herds on the hillsides or secondary grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, in the same way as the widely known shepherds.
Cartwheels were invented in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the early railway carriages were only made up of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the more rugged roads of the time.
Train tracks were invented a little earlier to fix the tracks, but it later became clear that over time placing a rail bar above the track made it more efficient.
This has become a common practice, however, as iron causes wear on wooden carts, the wheels of carts are also more prone to wear.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron bar was introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation, and humans began to walk upright around two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, is not consistently vertically disturbed.
Species with two legs were found in the Australopithecus fossil record from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, although the coelacanth may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists for reducing future suffering somewhat.
This is just like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and we must end them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity's scientific and technological advances, and that problems have become greater due to human overpopulation and human overindulgence in lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks from the building to John Dunlap's printer.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall lobby on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read by him at the troop in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The Dunlap Twenty-five Fold is the oldest surviving copy of the United States Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day. They are called birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that look a lot like dinosaurs.
It has protruding feet with claws, and white, and walks on hind legs like a Lyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on the processing of binary-digit encrypted information by default.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if we use the metrical computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately symptomatic, and a rapid diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as thrush, which is common enough, appear.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indicator of internal intoxication.
Read the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted well to the human environment.
Both "killer mice" and "bed bugs" have a long incubation period, and they adapt to living in their host's nest or shelter.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disorder among young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption , the adoptive parents terminate their parental rights so that the other parent can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not unique in this regard, experimentation is a test that may be used to test the validity of one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
They accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the existence of and produced by circadian self-cycles through the circadian clock.
They have discovered that cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, are the property of most organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that persist for periods of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chess experiment was one of the first major arguments that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or viruses to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to characterize either nucleic acid using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are cells of the antiseptic line.
Mutations in germline cells can only be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing and documenting the Bornean orangutans.
People leave small towns by car every morning to go to their workplaces and are met by the second person working in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic mode of transport, everyone is supporting and in some way connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this carbon-based mega-economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that has underpinned human evolution over the past two billion years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses public transport systems. Everyone complains about public transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems like this generate complaints, and why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of people and vehicles individually between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic analysis is difficult because it is not possible to predict the behavior of a driver with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic has a reasonably consistent frequency, which can be expressed mathematically in approximate terms.
To better illustrate traffic flow, they established relationships between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings backwards along the length of their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot spread their wings today are the firefly and the moth.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some found it to be correct and many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the ground moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to 6 miles wide at times.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Pyramids of Giza are not surpassed in size and architectural excellence.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were astonished by the relics of their ancestors, which had been buried for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state functionaries, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known of the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these elements are detected in nature in their original form and can be extracted in a relatively simple manner using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle postulated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they change into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are of course metals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that a trillion of them could take the place of the dot at the end of this sentence.
Since then, the pencil has been a good friend to many people for what it has become.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil was replaced in favor of a smaller one.
People now type messages on computer screens, without the need to use a scrubber.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works by collecting energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It is like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some neutron particles are unstable which means they tend to decay with or without simple motion.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the shell is about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more lunar seals on the near side because the crust is less thick. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or wants that emerge spontaneously when they reach puberty.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two common theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second-factor theory.
In general, sloppiness can appear when managers begin to lead former peers in an attempt to remain "just like everyone else" (or others).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, the individual becomes unrecognizable as he feels he has to change everything the team has and does.
In the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same eligibility criteria as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a single point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may be assembled according to different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true "stealth team" was described by Larson and Lovasto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the Invisible Team management team, which sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of implementing corporate learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
Because of this, collaboration within an organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new innovative actions that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
(Angel (2006), explains sustainability as a methodology used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The data associated with neuroscience provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge inference. This narrows the field of inquiry and makes it much more precise.
The association between brain and behavioral pathology supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structure and function of the brain in ways we never could before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Things like that have become separate fields that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been used to build various software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a teacher may wish to take her students to places where a bus trip would be considered impossible.
The technology is delivered through virtual field visits. Students can view the museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or enjoy the fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a nice way to remember a particular trip and share experiences with future classmates.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' handwriting. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammatical and spelling grammar, having an audience can generally change this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to write better in order to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become smarter about the world around them".[26] The need to feed the public's attention inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that inspires and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "allow students to become more analytical and critical; through active response to online materials, students can identify their positions within the context of others' writing as well as form their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a host of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is to the south, and to the north is a landscape of natural beauty that was used by Moscow and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as the thing that is considered the Canadian heartland to outsiders.
The larger regions in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost completely unpopulated.
In a demographic comparison that leaves many surprised: the African-American population living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and is an independent continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it was widely spread in the Comoros and Maut.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the African coast, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: Regardless of actual social status, wives should declare that they are already married.
It is better to wear a ring (but not the one that looks too expensive).
Women are aware that cultural differences may lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is common to observe them, holding hands, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your guns (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Meromids all used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port named "Anfa" after its founding by Berber hunters in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as "Casa Branca", but it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan as Dar-ul-Lubadiya, and renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan traditional Moroccan traditional Moroccan traditional traditional Moroccan traditional traditional goods in all parts of the old old city in the old old old city of old old city of old old old city of old old old city of old old city of old old old old old city of old old old old old old old old city of old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east of the country near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo which covered most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside Goma are necessary to research in order to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, whereas Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also the base for Mount Niragongo climb and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can ride a Buda Buda (a motorcycle that also functions as a taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual fare (local) is around 500 CFA francs for a short trip.
Besides its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for a faraway, strange land.
Timbuktu is nowadays considered a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the fact that it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main attractions of Henry Louis Gates's PBS series on the wonders of the African world.
The city differs markedly from the rest of the country in having a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park's area is 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is considered one of South Africa's major attractions, as well as its main park of the South African National Parks (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee for park maintenance and admission, as with all national parks in South Africa.
You would do well to buy a Wild Card , which gives you access to a select group of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place where many tourists consider their hometown.
The row of buildings that draw Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering skyline that appears over the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Column of the Navy on the opposite side.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated heavily on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists made their own place, so if you are looking for a guide to the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest inland littoral zone in the world, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) across the remote coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian Territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps of mangroves; they are some of the last evidence of the dense scrub that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 wild deer in the area.
Buses to the inner inter-city (river) terminal depart during the day, although most buses, especially those going east and to Jakarta/Bomanthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the stations are usually full , it is better to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and powerful Japanese buses called "cousters".
Taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Bonache (No. 200).
The Ouyabouka River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Ouyabouka River and connects the cities of Ouyabouka in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-Ouyabouka in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two arches that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge will not open to traffic until March 2017 .
The bridge is due to be fully operational in September 2017, around the same time as the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and the Payagu√°, who subsisted by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", came into existence as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news of the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the Pound Sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in more cases Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
In remote islands it is possible that they do not accept credit cards, although they may accept British and US currency; check with the owners beforehand to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so you must exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the atmosphere colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year, as there are no defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human observation, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay away from bears and wolves at least 100 yards per metre, and from all wild animals at least 25 yards per metre!
No matter how easy it may seem for them, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can be attacked.
Many guests are injured every year, because they do not sit far, and these animals are large and wild and dangerous and therefore must be given special space.
Also, be careful as odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia City. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Abia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans were drowned.
During Mao's struggle for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount leader, Tupua Tamashi Lilofi III.
As a result of "Auckland " being between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (North Harbor area) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy so it is safe to swim, and most are shaded by trees with walnut shades.
Tamaki Roads beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St. Helier's in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main beer is known as "number one", which is not a drink, but a fun and refreshing beverage. The second local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are very varied, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is hard to find water bottles, if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is a strange one. A small black coffee is an espresso, cappuccino is topped with a layer of cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate is Belgian-standard hot. The fruit juices are excellent, but expensive.
They make many trips to the reef throughout the year, and coral reefs rarely get damaged for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. It can occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will flee from humans when they see them.
Saltwater crocodiles are generally not ocean-dwelling, with their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep or a place to stay when he reaches his destination.
Although it is possible to book secondary forms of accommodation, such as camping spots, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents usually deliver packages including breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even package deals including flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get another documentation for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp on-site and consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to attend the events, you must check in early to get a campsite near the music.
Note that while the music on the main stage may have ended, some sections of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some of the festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin position, as crossing through the ice causes a lot of noise to the most vulnerable people.
The Saint Petersburg cruises include a short visit to the city. Cruisers are exempt from the requirement of a visa (see conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually missing, and it may be difficult to find outside.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcohol, but alcohol interferes with good judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of keeping the gambler sober.
Everyone who drives his car over high altitudes or on mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is less and you can drive less as you would on smooth asphalt.
And during a blizzard, enough snow may fall to make you stop for a very short time.
It can be caused by snow falling, freezing winds, condensation processes, or the presence of ice on car windows within sight.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and most popular with many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to traveling across the country to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, elephants and tigers sometimes feel shy and can be seen with a microscope.
Hiking (also called "jungle walking" or "hiking" or "hiking") consists of doing a walking tour, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events in the Games alternating between locations in Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympics, it became the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the postponement announcement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not be in place until July 2020, when the Olympics are supposed to take place.
Most tickets for the event are expected to fetch between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while the typical ticket price will be around 7,000 yen.
A coffeemaker helps dry wet clothes. Many hotels offer a coffeemaker and a coffee table for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no coffee, or if you do not like to drink alcohol, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not overheat the cloth (which may cause chafing or, in the worst case, burning).
There are different methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some places you can only heat the water for a minute, in other places you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travellers are likely to encounter animal pests unfamiliar to their native areas.

The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont contains the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it passes regularly through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages and steep curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict compliance is paramount.
Curiously, mobile service here appears to be much stronger than in many of the secondary areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania State Forest.
German pastry is excellent, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is popular as apples are cooked in pastry all year while cherries and plums are popular in summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, and the buns are often eaten specially with a little concentrated coffee.
If you fancy a rich, small pastry, try the so-called Berliner, Funk√∂cken or Krapffen, depending on the region.

In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in South India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines that are spread throughout Indonesia, due to Indonesia's 17,000 islands to differentiate them.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to imply that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely spread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simple dishes, the main flavours favored by Javanese are peanut, spices, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The collars serve as supports for the rider's feet that rest on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but his leg gets caught in the bridle, the horse may pull him back if he runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a very tight and soft heel.
Secondly, some saddles, particularly the English saddle, have safety bars that allow the saddle to fall off the saddle when pulled back when the rider is dismounted.

Sloppy snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a patch of snow-covered ground on skis or a skateboard mounted on your legs.
Skiing is a major activity during travel and with a large number of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski vacationers", planning a whole vacation walk around the ski resort.
The idea of skiing is very old  the cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking, skiing or ice-hiking.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but is not generally limited to snowboarding or mountaineering, which are practiced on extremely steep terrain and require harder skis and longer boots.
Think of a ski trail as a kind of a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than walking, but you rarely reach long-distance skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and equipped trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent that has a large number of independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling across several countries means that you have to go through visa applications and passport controls many times.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can cross the border generally without having to go through customs twice.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each of the Schengen member states individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
Some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are over a hundred years old, but there is no universal definition of what constitutes an artifact.
The definition includes geographical differences, where the life expectancy may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as artwork even though they are more modern than similar goods mass-produced in the distant past.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important to many second-hand workers.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami ethnic groups have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they have subsisted from fishing, hunting and the like, and have used reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Many Sami people today work in modern crafts. Tourism is considered an important income in the Sami region of Sabmi.

If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or flight cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but the advice of those governments is specifically issued for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than those facing Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is a summary of the political situation in a country.
Opinions are often quick, general and simple compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.

Anyone who plans to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
You may find a local business address by searching the Internet for "Hostile Ecology Tour".
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail and usually through practical experience.
The course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines that explain survival in the wild while there are few publications that describe war zones.
Passengers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid documentation for the return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without a gender X or to issue new documents to fit a desired gender or name.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoints became far more secretive in the years after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people should not be expected to go through screening before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
A rip current is the backflow of waves that cross a shore, often near a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater terrain, the backflow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current may form into the deep water there.
Most of the deaths occurred from exhaustion from trying to swim upstream, which may have been impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, the return trip is no less easy.
Try to aim for a place where the current will not overtake you again or, depending on your skills and if someone notices your presence, waiting for a rescue may be a second option.
Homecoming trauma occurs more quickly than culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Sometimes, travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture have a special difficulty re-adapting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your customs that are unique to your home country's culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were probably more patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning to their home country.
The Pyramid Sound and Light show is one of the most fun things to do in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in a mirror and in silence before the performance starts.
You can usually hear the noise of tourists and vendors here. The story of the sound and light is like a story in a book.

They show the viewer the pyramids and they show the different pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have many claimants and the most extensive base, with an effective number of 16 in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres north of the peninsula.The largest of these is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other places include Livingston Island, and Deception where the caldera, submerged by an active volcano, provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost part of the Peninsula, bounded by Blenheim House Land.
The Peninsula mountains here merge into the Plateau, and then retreat back into the surface to form the Ellsworth Range, which extends for 360 km, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif where its summit reaches 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not always an alternative to a mobile phone, which means that you have to be out of sight of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by charter services, including pleasure boats, as well as exploration missions requiring data and voice telephony.
A local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about how to contact this service.
Traveling and learning is a very popular choice for those planning a holiday.
It is especially popular with high school graduates, as it allows them to spend a year before going on to university, without risking their education.

There is usually a registration fee for these courses.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also contains thousands of islands, both lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to visit the islands and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayak boats offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, as there are boats for seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is entirely unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several full days on the way home and sleep on the ship at night.
If you are travelling on a coastal cruise on a ship, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some trips feature the German city of Berlin in the brochures; as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and the price does not include city visits.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic accident.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's not so different from the personal fears and secondary aversions that many people have.
Understanding something about how planes work and what happens during flight may help some people overcome fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Freight companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Timing is usually critical with respect to documents, goods and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies have their own planes, some of the lines, but there was a problem for second lines and smaller companies.
If they send the goods by air, it may take several days at some customs and unloading routes.
Sending the package as checked baggage was the only way to get it delivered quickly, but domestic regulations do not allow airlines to send baggage without a passenger, so it is your turn now.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to set aside a substantial sum for the privilege (or rather, to have your company do it).
However, this does not come cheap: as a strict rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business economy fare, and eleven times that in first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi≈üinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian but Russian is widely spoken.
The multi-ethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994 the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been reestablished.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Above all, from the north, you can visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Sacred Tomb), the site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially on a mass grave site, as well as a site that has almost no meaning for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many other people who had loved ones killed or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all dignity, respect and respect it deserves. Do not forget the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disturb the site by placing signs or graffiti on the walls of buildings.
The city of Barcelona has two official languages, Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understands it, while almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are expressed in Catalan because it is by law the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are broadcast only in Catalan, while unexpected disturbances are broadcast by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are famous for their selfishness, audacity and arrogance.

The dense forest that fills Lake Plitvice National Park is mainly pine, spruce and oak, and is distinguished by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It has a large and diverse collection of plant communities, due to the range of local climates, different soil types, and different levels of elevation.
The region also contains a very diverse assortment of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, jackal, wildcat and turkey can be found there, along with many of the more common second species.
During the visit to the monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover both knees and shoulders, as well.
Most monasteries provide a scarf for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own scarf, especially a brightly colored one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are asked to wear trousers that cover both knees.
These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance, but they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of the rest of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), with olive oil used throughout.

Modern observatories are usually no longer usable today, and are preserved as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution at its core is not as significant a problem as it is today, it is often present in cities or on college campuses and is much more accessible than these buildings in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas with the right atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing - known as hanami - has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where dandelions were the most common.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom ceremonies exclusively for himself and for members of the lower nobility around the imperial court.
Plants thrive best in their natural habitat, so resist the urge to harvest even if it is just one specimen.
When visiting a formally organized park, collecting "specimens" will also result in your expulsion, no question.
Generally, Singapore is considered a very safe and easy place to travel, where you can buy almost anything once you arrive.

Many traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in various parts of the world.
There is a tradition of staying up all night until Easter to watch the sunrise in an open place.
This tradition can certainly be interpreted from a Christian theological point of view, but there is also the possibility that it was a religious celebration of spring and fertility from pre-Christian times.
The more traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on Saturdays during Easter weekend, and the gatherings often begin with a celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally reached the islands came either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, no mammals could make the journey, leaving the giant tortoise as the main grazing animal of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats and dogs.
If you decide to visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the Arctic Night, which means that the sun never rises above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to watch the aurora, where the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the area is sparsely populated and light pollution is unlikely to be a problem, you can also enjoy stargazing.
The Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are the traditional working clothes, and colleagues call each other by their family names or professional titles.
Harmony in the workplace is considered a very important virtue, as it emphasizes teamwork rather than individual achievement.
Workers are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question, and they must frequently obtain the consent of their superiors on any decisions they make.
