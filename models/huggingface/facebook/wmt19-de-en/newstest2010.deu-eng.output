Barack Obama becomes fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to become the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
He will also receive the diploma, medal and cheque for $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The White House chief of staff arrives in the Norwegian capital tomorrow with his wife Michelle and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon with the ceremony at which Obama will accept the prestigious award.
He is the fourth US president to receive the award, but only the third to receive it directly in office.
The White House has already indicated that Obama will speak about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The President does not want to dodge this issue, because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The programme will include a banquet with the President and his wife, attended not only by Norway's King and Queen, but also by the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests.
Obama has been very reticent about the price from the start.
He said, for example, that he felt he didn't quite deserve the award.
He also repeated several times that this is a prize not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Conservationist is accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civic association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases over the past year, he has appealed against some construction procedures, demanding money from investors for the withdrawal of his appeals, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Association is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting dumpsters in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find sorting garbage containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There one would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I am not saying that waste sorting would not work at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that the councillors are not taking enough care of this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste division of the Jungle League, not only because we citizens here are only allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket in the centre, for example?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is Moravia Square opposite the Meet the Goose.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be annoyed, but that does not seem to me to be enough.
Apart from the fact that sorting waste in other parts is not honey-licking.
Whole rows of my friends, therefore, prefer not to sort the rubbish at all.
Out of laziness.
It's too far to the dustbins for them.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the party, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street I did not see any paint garbage cans in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when driving the tram.
But the garbage almost overflowed.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, right?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetic probably leaves the Brno socialists cold.
They would rather buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the country, instead of buying a few more bins and sorting out more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics, too, after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno really has the worst position in the whole South Moravian region.
The "Paroubek" budget has deprived the money for pensions and sick pay
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and civil servants, despite the government's view, there is no money left in the budget for pensions, sick pay and building societies.
But also not for the interest on the national debt or for the international litigation.
That will cause even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the finance minister, Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists pushed through the salary increase for some groups, they calculated that the government would borrow extra money for sensitive expenses, old age pensions or sick pay. "This is just a postponement of the problems of the future, laying mines," says Janota.
In fact, the interest rates on the loans are getting higher and higher, and the money will have to be repaid at some point.
Too much to choose from, from where take, the treasury is empty.
If social security benefits or the cost of state business are not cut, the tax is to be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for her children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, from which 1.8 billion have disappeared, they get this money.
But at the cost of getting even more indebted - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing from the state's coffers, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to rise faster and faster, together with the costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to cut maternity pay, as the government did in its counterdeficit package.
Due to the transfer of money in favour of certain constituencies, there will also be a shortfall of EUR 5 billion next year for the upgrading of motorways and railways.
These are predominantly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly cheaper.
At the very most, it is not free.
This means the delay or closure of thirty large structures, and the creation of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money Solomon-esque - it attacks CEZ share dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never certain, and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the CEZ injected 18 billion into the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay the environmental damage liquidation, replenish the pension account and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the actual budget deficit rises to 5.7 percent of GDP, according to EU rules.
But this is not the end of the carnival of upheaval.
The budget for various types of compensation for victims of communism and crime, or for legal disputes, even for saving money on construction, fell by almost three billion.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister then has to save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-billion-euro "treasury" project, which has already begun and is intended to enable monitoring on-line of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first leg starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be halted and sanctions would follow, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
In the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
All you have to do is press one button, and Windows Mobile turns into Android within seconds.
This is exactly the possibility that the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware hinted during an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will hit the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test sample with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, running Windows Mobile and Android at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working together with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices should come to the customer within the year 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Not only the inhabitants of the Krkonoše Mountains are worried about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Krkonoše Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited frequently.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud," said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly as you want, you should not hesitate to order it.
If you prefer to save money and the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindleruv Mlyn hotel owners now mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will try to sell them for a while yet, but then they will have to give in and go for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
The Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still available.
That is why we have prepared some cheaper holidays for the last moment, said the director of Ingtours travel agency, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free seats.
Sales are also strong for the first fortnight in February, with average sales for the rest of the winter.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Krkonoše Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed in within a week, Christmas will be sold out, Schiefert says.
Conversely and somewhat better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms in the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and at Christmas we only have a few spare rooms.
There is a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will be going well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
s Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia at the central car park in Janske Lazne is also occupied.
On the other hand, half of the beds in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne will be available at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are currently occupied to about 60 percent.
February is now a little weaker, but the moment the snow arrives, interest in stays in the Krkonoše Mountains will certainly increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia hotel.
Hotel owners in the Krkonoše Mountains are now waiting for more snow.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is precipitation it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming should come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Meteorological Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost comical that Barack Obama, the president with his reputation for being the brightest, is repeating the strategy of his predecessor on Afghanistan, whom he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it transpired that he copied it from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward," without hesitation.
Even three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh troop contingents to civil-war-ravaged Iraq as an "irresponsible and, in its aftermath, catastrophic decision."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible one, and very successful to the extent that today there is no mention of Iraq at all in the news.
Bush's reputation has not been improved by this, for objectively he has left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a repeat of the miracle.
He has been asked again by the military to increase the troop contingent, especially by the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his habit of subordination, harshly criticized the dithering shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 troops to turn the situation around for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, so he cheated the general at least by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pressed for a further 5,000, even though he himself had originally expected at least 10,000.
What is most problematic about the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete the process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honoring values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
In these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded correctly, remain only sham buildings behind which patriarchal ancestral relations will continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the situation, which further complicates Pakistan and Iran's influence.
Also, the building of an "effective state," which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy bewildered by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is on the verge of exploding.
Only a truly romantic soul who is unimpressed by facts can believe that the little soldiers who broke out into the howls of war about the "early return home" are able to create a miracle here.
From a political point of view, the date for troop withdrawal is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is coming to an end.
Nor can Europe's politicians explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the evolution of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not have an effect on the Iranians, the question for the United States is whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
That question needs to be answered as America moves toward a post-Obama withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is that there are still three years left until the presidential election, so there is plenty of time for him to resort to another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The announcement was made by the firm in response to sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares in lieu of the money, but they will not be allowed to sell until five years from now.
Furthermore, the shares can be withdrawn from managers if they are acting in an excessively risky manner.
Goldman Sachs is spearheading efforts to combine Wall Street's bonus bonuses with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
"I think Wall Street is aware of the wider direction it has to take," said Douglas Elliott, a former JPMorgan banker.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for bonus bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses due later this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-off 50 per cent tax on bankers' bonuses above £25,000.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record-breaking women have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes in the categories of literature and literature from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was won by the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidating the structure and function of the ribosome.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman won a Nobel this year was physics.
This prize was won today by the scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fibre optics and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for his invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel medals and certificate of acquisition of the monetary prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the US President, Barak Obama, received the most eagerly awaited Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversies surrounding his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey and also leads the country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus has invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
The budget, and perhaps Janota's remaining in the cabinet, are expected to be the topics of Friday's meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, reported on the meeting.
Janota plans to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about whether he will remain in his position.
According to the budget law, which is now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, however, the parliament voted on the Left-wing proposals for a monetary shake-up and increased the money for state salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the social democrats by concealing an increase in the budget deficit.
A sharp internal political dispute has therefore arisen between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other. This raises the question mark over the further work of the Fischer cabinet of civil servants, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed on in the spring.
Critics say the budget, as passed by parliament, effectively liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the government in the autumn, which they say is designed to end the national debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget, said today at a breakfast with business leaders that politicians had neglected the "serious problem" of "the unsustainable deficit" in public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only come from a strong government, which could also rely on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget was dreadful and that the government should consider its future existence.
The ODS vice-chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servants "cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
In his editorial, Premier Fischer described similar words as "strong statements."
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to Topolanek's words that the budget deficit, which the previous Topolanek government had prepared for this year, exceeded 200 billion kronor, was horrendous.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new film
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country, its struggles and victories, despite some reviews that the lead role was cast by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
In his life story, the American Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman portrays the tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon has another significant role to play.
I told him: "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in the Eastwood boxing drama "Million Dollar Baby," has already portrayed the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, which eventually turned into a slave owner, a fictional US president, and God in "Evan Almighty," but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became the country's president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "undefeated," and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby world's outsiders.
Eventually, the South African team progressed to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the big screen.
He had no other goal than to play that role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world leader were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
"I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you are feeling," he said.
For me, it's important to be a different person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in the film, in which white players prevail.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his home.
I remember when I rang the doorbell he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in stature between the actors and their actual role models, "Invictus: Undefeated," directed by Eastwood, has received positive reviews and talk of Oscar prospects.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment: 'It was a very good story, a very well executed film.'
In film reviews on the web site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 per cent positive reviews.
Mystery over Norway solved: Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian defence ministry only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile had been tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again unsuccessful, and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Nor did his repeated presence on the ground during the missile test have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time Bulava has not taken off at all or been damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers have already written about "Bulava" as a "rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that does not fly, but glows
This attempt, which was already the 13th, went normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred again.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be launched from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over northern routes caused by an indeterminate flying object was in fact the damaged "Bulava."
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
This time, however, the generals have stood their ground, claiming that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket failed and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even though no test launch went off without a hitch, Defense Department officials say only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generals with optimism, and so it is continued that the "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov, 51, is once again competing in a professional ice hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and is likely to face St. Petersburg in Friday's KHL duel.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
With Denis Kuljas injured, we desperately need another defender.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov as saying.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the famous hockey player's comeback will involve just one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the morale of other players, 'Nemcinov said.
When Fetisov returns to the rink, he will become Russia's oldest professional hockey player, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, racking up 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles in the Soviet Union and also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the latter part of his career, he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Sternzimmer.
Hyundai caved in to unions, cancelling all overtime
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai has reached an agreement with the union to abolish all overtime.
The union announced on Monday that it was ready to strike because of frequent overtime orders.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek.
But management wants to reach an agreement with the unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production schedule, which is a principle, which is why on Saturday 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
Employees will also receive this retrospectively for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they get paid the overtime bonus, or they can take a substitute holiday on December 28 to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees on the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning issue regarding demands and complaints of the trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to suspend all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, workers at the car factory had been forced to work two hours of overtime every day after the eight-hour shift.
Once the agreement has been signed, the unions' willingness to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the car factory came to a head last week, on Wednesday, when around 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for continuous overtime.
They also protested the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that employees have to work overtime to meet the demand for automobile deliveries.
In their call for strike readiness on Monday, the trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions are calling for overtime to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5 000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice- car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production started at the company in November last year.
As of this September, approximately 80,000 vehicles have been manufactured here, and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works even in 'hardened' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as strong an effect on common virus variants as one of the existing drugs.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, the combination of drugs can prolong the life of patients and prevent the replication of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus replication also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no drugs are effective any more.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical and Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances known as metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus replication in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would arise.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the replication of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work, which was published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically altered further.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease has been tested in the test tube, including against their stable (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the case of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical compositions, make metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Controversy over budget. ODS went after fisherman, who fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "dreadful," and in his opinion the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its future existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statement as a "strong statement."
It is said to take time for analysis.
The Deputy Chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the civil servants "cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to lean on the minority in parliament to fight the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Socialists to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
The parliament on Wednesday approved the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has increased money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the social democrats that they increase the budget deficit covertly.
The Czech Republic was to operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
ODS left the chamber before the vote, so it complied with the government's request, because the amended budget is also only a less bad variant of the provisional budget. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer stated that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota registered with the prime minister on Monday after the government deal.
In doing so, he has indicated that he is considering remaining in office.
This is because of his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
According to Necas, the extent to which Fischer is in favour of continuing the fight with the budget deficit has nothing to do with the nominators of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who pushed through the changes in the budget, in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing legislation, such as those relating to sick pay and pensions, or the Service Amendment.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
That is a matter for the Prime Minister and the Government as a whole.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek emphasized in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a deputy capacity who are committed to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the fight against the deficit level of the public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left majority that is currently in parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the civic democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it is up to date, I will deal with it, "Martin Bartak, the defence minister nominated by the civil democrats, told journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday, if the prime minister explicitly asked the citizens "democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not think of ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, so he reacted to the question whether ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in the parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realise my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that the next few months would be all about Bolshevising the parliament and destroying everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will run for approximately the same fare.
Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some low-capacity fast and local trains from 13 December, while other services will be strengthened.
From the date of validity of the new timetable, the total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today.
Most fares including basic and customer fare will not be changed.
For example, residents of the Ostrava region will have several connections to the capital, and the railway will use Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer run to Bratislava.
Fewer fast trains will also operate on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, and direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced in principle.
The biggest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove, by a total of eight percent, whereas Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two overnight trains on the Prague - Tabor - Ceske Budejovice route will also be cancelled, and some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Ceske Budejovice route will be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently Milovice residents have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Main Railway Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk / Jesenik will run every two hours.
Passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava on the Pendolino since 13 December.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million increase
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and the railways will receive four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, just as they did this year. Local trains will supply the districts, and they will pay eight billion crowns in total for the next year, with the state contributing three billion crowns.
This year, regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the high-speed trains, the railway has signed a new ten-year contract; until now, the contract was only ever concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, which is perhaps one of the reasons why they have not resorted to price increases for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only apply to one-day CD Net network tickets and low-cost eLiska internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The eLiska price will then depend on the travelled route, till now it was uniform for travel between any regional cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militiamen have arrested more than 50 people and the children have been released.
Millionaires kidnapped 75 people, including some elementary school students and their teachers, in the southern Philippines today.
That was cited by the AFP agency, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children, including a teacher, were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as live shields while fleeing police.
Local negotiators are now trying to secure the release of the remaining hostage.
According to the AFP agency, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that demanded revenge attacks between the two local clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Thirty journalists were among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was linked to the election for governor.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated," which tells the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, will be released in American cinemas.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid campaigner has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly selected by Mandela himself several years ago.
Matt Damon has been cast in the supporting role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar.
With the film's theatrical release, reactions from critics and the public have also been loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born July 18, 1918, in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed on the film because it is released in cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are on the one hand culminating, and at the same time the media are shaking up the world's public with alarming news about rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are generally positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about casting American Hollywood stars in the lead roles.
Morgan Freeman says he is still proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person several times so that I could - as they say - receive his energy, he said in an interview after the film's Los Angeles festival premiere.
I think it's a good thing that with this film we can remember Mandela's personality and his message.
It's a South African story, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the original book by the British writer John Carlin, loosely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African champion of human rights during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman strives over the course of the film to bring together two racial and segregated communities, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he steps onto the World Cup field in his role in the South African National Rugby team, which South Africa won at the time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela received a huge ovation, mostly from the white audience, for stepping on the lawn dressed in what is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be able to unite people into a single nation, according to rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves remains to be seen.
But white South Africans are sceptical, as revealed by rugby fan Christopher Dawson in a recent interview for LN, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the Ceps transformer in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny region.
Six units intervened in the fire, according to Lukas Marvan, spokesman for the Usti nad Labem district fire brigade.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to let the transformers burn out, but later they changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, an internal transformer short circuit.
No one was injured, and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the piping system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, the damage will be more precise only after the fire can be quantified.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
Nothing similar has happened at Ceps for more than 10 years, and mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokeswoman of CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, and the fire at the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of 400 kV and 220 kV electric lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to the distribution system and transmission line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura is suing three heads of the CSSD for defamation.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today filing criminal charges for defamation against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Moravia region, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice region and Martin Tesarik, head of the Olomouc region.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute radio interview.
The lawsuit is related to the company's effort to operate regional train services in some districts.
In the end, all regions signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying that we are taking out the raisins, but we have made the offer only to the extent that it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were concluded last week.
So we have no choice but to fight back.
Because of this defamation of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radio Journal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the lawsuit to be a continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for himself.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do the same.
"I think it will also become clear in this case that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public and using lying and untrue arguments in the case of regional rail transport," Hasek said.
Jancura said last week that he had invested several million kronor in advertising that would highlight the disadvantageous move by the districts.
He told the Radio Times that he is suspending the campaign after Christmas and intends to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts reached an agreement with Czech Railways at the instigation of regional rail transport and did not put out tenders for the contract worth 150 billion crowns.
Vancura considers such behaviour to be illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, a deputy from the CSSD also threatened him because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was that if we did not renounce it, we would also lose our bus licences.
"He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who he is, I don't say his name," Jancura told the Radio Journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococci changes from January.
It will be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already there are voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are culminating.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August kids
From January, children born on and after August 2 last year can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Those who have already started with the vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for further repeated vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal.
Parents paid 1600 kronor or more for a dose.
Four doses are required to vaccinate the youngest children.
In total, the experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year on vaccination doses.
But they are saving on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about $500,000 a year on all of the children's vaccinations.
Mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal infections cause middle ear infections, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years per year, according to research carried out in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination may be compulsory in the future.
From January, this will be paid for by insurers and will be voluntary.
Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Nahlas civic association, mentioned, for example, that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has long campaigned for the pneumococcal vaccine.
The experts at the international conference in which our association participated were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to achieve at least that.
"I think that's the path we have to take now," Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
"At this moment we are not considering it at all," said his spokesman, Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors claim.
The President of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations. "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 per cent of parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal from next year.
The pneumococcal vaccine is also groundbreaking in that it is the first to be paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurers should spend the money on prevention so they can save for further treatment, Cabrnochova said.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern among pediatricians about the purchase of the vaccines.
Under the original plan, the vaccines would be bought through insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way as other vaccines given to them by the state.
But some MPs worried that this would allow insurers to "take the money out of people's health insurance."
As a result, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance companies to pay for them.
According to estimates, individual general practitioners will have to invest 40 000 kronor per month, which is a significant sum.
"It's not going to be easy," Cabrnochova said.
US artist's son involved in 'museum theft'
The son of famed American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his trailer vehicle.
Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man are said to have used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayal of characters like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, the Associated Press news agency reported.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "to enter the museum by any means necessary to take all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frank Frazetta Sr. denied giving any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax rises
Ministers have defended the tax rises and spending freeze announced in the pre-budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed an opportunity" to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has also come under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in National Insurance and a 1 per cent cap on public sector pay in 2011.
Social Security Anger
Unions have protested that low-paid workers are being punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of "problems ahead."
The increase in National Insurance - to about £3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
IN FOCUS OF THE FOREIGN EQUIPMENT REPORT
A further 0.5% increase in social security from April 2011
This year, the economy contracted by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 per cent rise in corporation tax for small businesses scrapped
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
2.5% increase in the state pension
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 a year poorer and someone with £40,000 a year will be £190 poorer, while someone with an annual income of £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 was a "difficult decision," but they also said that 60% of the burden of extra taxes would fall on the top 5% of earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and spending freeze outlined were "a drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers, they will help us halve the deficit and they are absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour's predictions about future economic growth - affecting the size of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction - have been called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
In his statement, he said the economy is likely to contract by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% fall predicted in April - while debt would be £3bn higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis," said the planned debt of £789bn over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to come up with a credible plan for how they will pay it back and are "cynically" avoiding tough decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They haven't said anything significant about what they're going to do," said Philip Hammond, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer, "they've had their opportunity to do it and they've let them pass."
'The major announcements won't be made until after the election, whoever wins it. '
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see the deficit cap coming sooner and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money raised from the tax rises and spending freeze would be used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on sand."
The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said some of the timing of the announcements - such as the aforementioned inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - would expose the Chancellor to accusations of vote-rigging, as the money could simply be clawed back next year.
Labour insists the extra help will be provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hollow budget"
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only take hold in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor's figures would mean sharp cuts in many areas, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It just shifts the pain on to later," said its head, Robert Chote.
"The major announcements won't be made until after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser at accountancy firm Deloitte.
'This was just the hollow pre-budget report, the markets realise that, 'he said.
FBI investigating 'arrests of US citizens in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in Virginia last month.
The US State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the charges they face and the circumstances under which they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their whereabouts if they are indeed the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said local police had taken an interest in the house before and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns' abuses' in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been for the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One man cited in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, there has been zero tolerance for criticism from the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was indicted for "working with Facebook networks" and for protesting the election results.
"They punched me in the face several times," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... They threatened me with death and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released into the street, still bleeding and semi-unconscious, Amnesty said.
Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he and 75 others had been held in a container at a detention centre in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that Iran's parliament and judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response to it, but Amnesty said the mandates and powers of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow have been used to turn a Bristol landmark into a race track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100-metre slope.
Student John Hickman, who is in his fourth year studying medicine, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city glittering below.
He added: 'There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent.'
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks - or tricks - performed on the slope.
After Thursday night's event, the snow will be left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted to ban the construction of minarets, and concern about the supposed Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and considered report on whether Muslims can - and will - be integrated into one of Europe's avowedly secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a contentious issue that divided and preoccupied the country for more than a decade and a half, the effects of which can still be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder range.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer what Bowen calls "Islamic freedom" to France's 5 to 6 million Muslims.
He is a good listener, reflecting debates between teachers and students on the issues that worry them most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, in stark contrast to the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers, and intellectuals, none of whom have a known name, with the possible exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Bowen surveyed are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts - advocates of purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia - who now have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes Muslim values and French secularism can be reconciled.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
It questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so passionately guards the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may receive harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He sees a "tightening of the screws on values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's bleakest outlook
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks them is melting at an alarming rate, carrying life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear, in "On Thin Ice."
Well versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea who fought only with the butt of his musket is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers have been taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo facilities typically still have one millionth of the habitat of a wild adult animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became completely green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, slaying continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-riding Inuit use powerful assault rifles to kill their prey.
Ironically, in the waters to the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist," offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future might unfold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
However, this is not due to a lack of attempts at explanation.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century gave the first glimpse of the swirling of the pack ice.
During the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting ridges as they went under.
Satellite surveys and the large-scale application of probes on icebergs are a useful addition, but much is still achieved by intrepid people camping out in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater tributaries that are compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, everyone is at risk if the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us"
Marines were among 6,000 laying wreaths at Arlington
Corporal De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have followed.
"In a couple of months, wherever we come from, we could be," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect like that.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral wreath maker Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, established the tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition, and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make the trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also set up a not-for-profit organisation, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas near the Pentagon, at graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the second time to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped up in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the cemetery's sprawling lawns and hills.
Volunteers targeted older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because they are not visited as often as newer graves, organizers said.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the gray gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained mostly quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the section, but the somber mood of the current wars filled the area.
Some openly wept, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the freezing air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bent down to small black-and-white place cards that had been stuck in the damp mud for those whose headstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave site of Marine Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, 'she said.
'When I've been away for a long time, I want someone to remember him. '
US government contractor detained by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the U.S. Embassy in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not yet been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything on charges of "endangering."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been refused.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
News of the arrest was first reported Friday night by The New York Times.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will reciprocate if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
Only this year did the Cuban government allow ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, which is mainly used to send text messages, since a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, spokeswoman for the U.S. advocacy group in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the handing over of free cellphones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently released a tough report on freedom in Cuba titled "New Castro, same Cuba," a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as both countries are moving toward greater willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani officials unveil plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered an alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope the case could help uncover a sprawling network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an obscure insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after spotting them because one of them had posted supportive comments on the Internet video site YouTube about terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men upon their arrival in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said Saturday that Saifullah failed to convince al Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains to the northwest that have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of an undercover operation.
That's why they were rejected, said the government official, who wished to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were far from disheartened and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role recruiters play in identifying future terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American would-be recruits are being subjected to special scrutiny by al Qaeda, analysts said.
But they are also seen as hugely attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and propaganda value.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about whom they allow access, as US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have followed? "said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more internet-based.
Tens of thousands of protesters demand climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate change from negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates put the number at around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosive devices near some government buildings downtown.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists marched through the city holding banners reading "There is no Planet B" in English and one in Spanish declaring "The Earth Says" Enough. "
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
"That's part of the reason why I decided to join the big demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police stopped protesters from getting too close to the Bella center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to an onlooker, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators dressed in black detonated several explosive devices near Copenhagen's main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flares but were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest does not appear to have reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "It's something I wasn't even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin, saying: 'Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside.'
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Exam data shows persistent racial divide
The math scores were welcome good news for D.C. public schools last week.
Although the District of Washington still lags far behind the nation's top-performing schools, the records show that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, at both the local and national levels.
The average score of D.C. "s white fourth graders rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) over the past two years, but that of their African-American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained essentially the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the district's first NAEP was recorded, was 60 points (262 to 202).
And while the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased over that period, the gap has barely narrowed, now 58 points.
Some education advocates in the district expressed concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students who are already high-achieving children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in Washington, D.C.
"I'm not jumping up and down for a margin of two or three points," said Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what worries me is that we are not spending anywhere near the time and energy that we would need to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school careers and who lag significantly behind their peers.
Everyday math, a curriculum that focuses on games and lifelike experiences from kindergarten through sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey, and the curriculum credits some of the NAEP's progress reported last week.
"I think we need to continue to work to ensure that the best policies benefit students who are below grade level," Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP findings highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources needed to close the gap for low-performing schools.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studies city exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct resources and management reforms toward schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could have political repercussions that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other city school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle classes.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a schools inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements in closing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers union last year for 185 days a year, which he sees as "a milestone" on the path to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a future prospect
The coach arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, brick facades and emerald lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her stance, and that of the group's other eighth graders exploring Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was that of an awestruck visitor rather than an enthusiastic prospective student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide announced that they had now entered the Science Building.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when told about the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour, and now they have fully absorbed the intended message: The question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of US-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other, there are hundreds of thousands who are receiving the college education needed to advance to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of this "second generation" of Hispanics graduates from college - a remarkable achievement, given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the US without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study high-achieving children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get into college, especially if those efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, then at some point a single measure won't solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from pre-school to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to launch college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate from high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraq Oil Ministry Signs Contracts with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to persuade major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions completed on Saturday.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry's 10 contracts with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia, and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in rebuilding Iraq's oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies won shares in only two of the 10 fields being auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has lost out.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-veiled representation of American oil multinationals at the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, have likely discouraged American oil companies from engaging more heavily in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said.
US firms have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have much lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to sign contracts with the department.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties to the Iraqi oil ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have been left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil ministry spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world's major economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for bidding submitted bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase output from each field beyond current levels.
Top al Qaeda planner apparently killed in Pakistan
A top al Qaeda operative was killed this week in an apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on a senior leader of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed by a series of rockets that hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday, according to U.S. and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle toward the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official in Miran Shah said by telephone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly seized all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities could not confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited vague evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as Al Qaeda's top military planner who led operations by terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role for granted, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Qaeda's top leaders and translated them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said Somali had risen quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and had close ties to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but that in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top operatives.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has dropped from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terror groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Senior UN envoy in Kabul to resign
The UN's top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous term marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Oath's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is due to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
"We need to speed up the build-up of the Afghan security forces, thereby sending the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with Afghanistan's political transition.
The troop increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but only fulfilling an agreement he made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now so he has time to find a replacement.
"What I've said is that he better start looking for a successor," Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun the search for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
UN officials say he has considered Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Oath's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive voter fraud.
Eide has denied all allegations, but he also said that the allegations by Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he has recommended the appointment of a top civilian official to coordinate relief efforts by American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who are donating to the Afghan mission, saying it would bolster their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations on his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome U.N. hiring rules have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I have only been able to employ one person.
This is catastrophic and cannot be allowed to continue.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not participating in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a seven-day tour of the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
"There are no good options in Iran," he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an outcome.
"One of the things that is on my mind, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, is the unpredictability inherent in the war," he said.
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has said some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the American administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran faces "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, for its nuclear program.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to curb its nuclear program and give up a significant portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US administration has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have walked away from negotiations on the tentative accords -- in part, experts say, because Iran's leaders are divided over whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community standing on some of the proposals they had already agreed to at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way they have never been in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to those proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what it on Thursday called "baseless and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities and said they were ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to find an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and public revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays in US plans to reduce American troop levels from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to allay Kurdish concerns about the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. officials quoted Gates saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you. '
A Change of Course in Aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave."
They learned these lessons so well that when Shanghai government officials, who had suddenly begun to change tack this summer, owing to the low birth rate and aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: "Absolutely not."
We have already put all our time and energy into having a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which produced two generations of notoriously plump, spoiled only children affectionately known as "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared with 6 when the policy took effect, the U.N. says.
Department of Population Issues, while the number of people aged 60 and older is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and the elderly made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of Shanghai's Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of reproductive age must have babies to "help reduce the ratio of aging populations and alleviate the labor shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- though not as rich -- as the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
China's one-child policy, enshrined in the country's constitution in 1978, is likely to be the most controversial executive order enacted by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and workplace discrimination.
Chinese officials have attributed the policy to avoiding critical use of the country's natural resources, while human rights advocates have condemned abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to have abortions.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife were only children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Department of Population Research, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with one partner as an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births in July.
Posters warning families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and push leaflets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial counselling to be provided for those who have more than one child.
The reaction wasn't exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai said there had been an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, urban districts reported no change.
Huinan Municipality, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected in the city in 2010 will still be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Municipality Family Planning Committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But, like many Chinese, they have only minimal government health and life insurance.
Without a social safety net, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misinterpret the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we are being deprived of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she only wanted one child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us.
We're not used to looking after others and we don't really want to. '
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, put it more bluntly.
For middle-class parents with dual careers that are driving down the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful and being selfish.
The 20- to 39-year-olds today grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment in capitalism, and they don't want a life like that for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, imposes huge demands on parents "time.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to remodel your home" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
"Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living," he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild posturing and recriminations -- refocused on Friday with the release of a document outlining an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing the brunt of the burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, identified both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time as more than 100 world leaders arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a specially created UN working group, makes no mention of the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how developed and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions, and what the upper limit for global temperature rise should be, which policymakers would support.
There will be a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, a senior fellow at the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big picture."
It shows the outline of a possible agreement under which developed countries would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave a boost to Friday's talks by pledging $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from coping with floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday, though, brought the same verbal fireworks that had dominated last week's talks.
Todd Stern, the US special envoy on climate change, has rejected language that calls for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not financed by industrialized nations.
The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than Bush administration officials did less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement unless major emerging economies stand up and take action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern's comments came an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said that America's top climate negotiator either lacked "common sense" or that it was "highly irresponsible" of him to say earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China tackle global warming.
With the future economic direction of the major world powers at stake, fault lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations, as well as between the industrialized and emerging economies.
The current struggle is as much about saving individual economies as it is about saving the planet, with China and the United States feuding over their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in holding countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game of what will become a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, though leaders say the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive by the small island states "exerts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and are demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the arrival of the leaders in order to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Vice Minister, got off their planes and raced through the corridors of the Bella Center for closed-door meetings and press conferences to map out claims to be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people go in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they believe are betraying and selling themselves, and draft contracts are passed from hand to hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is only just building: almost all the key ministers are here now, and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We're coming to the top of the league, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy for Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225km / h train redefines the feel of Monday
A whistle will go through the darkness at 5.13am on Monday morning to announce a train journey that will revolutionise transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will travel from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras at 225km / h, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Dame Kelly Holmes will join Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, on board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link the UK to an international network of fast, reliable trains, connecting the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, commute times would be radically reduced, and the switch from air and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three main parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still put the brakes on Britain's high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to deliver a feasibility study to the Government, will hand the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to The Times.
This will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will link London to the West Midlands, will pass by urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is disputed, with a margin of five metres.
In open terrain, the plan will demonstrate the concept within 25 meters of the final route.
HS2 will also provide three options for a larger, northbound high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead into the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best option," said one rail insider.
Once completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open until 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at speeds of 400km / h, making Britain's rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned in such a way that 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains an hour could be running on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal would be needed in London, which could handle 20,000 travellers an hour.
Given the space constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be upgraded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the plan should go ahead, but the lengthy public consultation and planning process means a final decision will not be made until after the general election.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
Trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing lines in the north of Birmingham, which would still take more than three hours to travel between London and Scotland.
This is seen as a crucial sticking point in ensuring a switch from airplanes to railways, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers foot the bill for Conservative's £75,000 orangery
Alan Duncan, the Conservative leader of the House of Commons, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built at his home in his constituency.
The party's prisons spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that MPs were living on "meagre rations," has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to buy an oak timber frame extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, a sum running into hundreds of pounds a month.
House of Commons leaders approved the proposals at the time and they have not been challenged by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of MPs' expenses, and Mr Duncan last night said the proposals could not have been "cleaner or clearer."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses nearby have sold for almost £1 million ($1.1 million).
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a House of Commons expenses watchdog, has agreed Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a conservatory, described in the plans as an "orangery."
Neighbours described it as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent review of his previous mortgage deals by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The committee cleared him of breaking the rules last month after an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a £271,406 mortgage from his London home to his constituency home, which he bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show Duncan was repaid about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims soared to more than £1,800 (2,000 euros) a month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during that time, suggesting that the entire increase was to fund borrowing of £75,000.
RBS's standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show Duncan continued to claim his entitlement to £1,250 (€1,400) a month in May.
Duncan lost his job as Leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs were "living on meagre rations" in the wake of the expenses scandal.
'Essentially, when you're working for the state, it means you have to live on meagre rations and be treated like s * * * * * e. '
He said: 'I've spent my money on my garden and I'm claiming a minuscule amount compared to what I should have.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't. '
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked over his expenses in May when it emerged he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the Fees Office that it "could be considered an exaggerated claim."
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed he had claimed £4,000 (4,500 euros) over three years.
Asked last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and meandering or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is completely transparent and strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer. '
Come to Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new purpose in life as an interactive advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme for each December day.
The event started on December 1 and visitors were allowed to view the newest hut every day from 5: 30 to 6: 30 pm with complimentary mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The carols selected so far are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël," where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary minister in the Chichester diocese and director of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important again for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express that through our spirituality. "
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement to combat global warming, where police have made hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the fringes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which was supposed to lead to a conclusion by Friday that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairwoman of the Climate Change Conference, the world's growing mobilization for climate change is contributing, as these demonstrations illustrate that the "political price" of failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed when a group of 300 protesters dressed all in black smashed shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
Anti-disturbance police officers intervened immediately and without hesitation.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their estimation mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs," these extremely violent splinter groups, which already made themselves famous at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April, have been arrested.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organisers of the demonstration, strongly criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militants had been arrested "without distinction," stressing that around a hundred of them "were still being held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and being in a seated position.
The rather peaceful procession passed from Parliament towards the Bella Centre, where the negotiations took place.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the scheduled speakers for a candlelight evening with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators arrived by bus and train from the major European cities, but there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky-blue raincoats, made their first run in Copenhagen in the morning, responding to the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice."
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological guilt of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that are drying up, streams where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of critics of globalization has come closer to environmental organizations.
The MEP José Bové, a figure of the critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The demonstrations have been launched in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to organisers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, marching in red and waving bandanas extolling solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, there were marches by several hundred demonstrators demanding a vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, while Georgia denounces it as a "coup."
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "coup."
Some 131,000 people were called upon to take part in the first vote after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17: 00 GMT.
Turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station closed, according to Abkhaz election commission officials.
The first provisional results were due to be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under a total Russian occupation, his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, has said.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the autonomy of this area of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, legally occupied by Russia.
After breaking away from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia wants to use this election to prove that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted forMr. Bagapch.
She was one of those who went to vote at a polling station located in a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs bearing Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are everywhere in this small area of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, he said at a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, particularly with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia hands control of the railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, on standby at all times, arrested about 700 people on the sidelines of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until the 18th of December receives delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement, which should enter into force on the 1st of January 2013.
From the parliament, the peaceful procession marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to enter.
A stage has been set up to welcome the speakers for a candlelight evening, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train passed, a group of protesters dressed all in black, armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing windows, an AFP journalist said.
Anti-disturbance police officers immediately surrounded you and intervened without hesitation by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs," the extremely violent splinter groups that made their name at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a policeman suffered a chin injury from a cobblestone during the incident, in which according to the police about twenty people were provisionally arrested. Four vehicles burned near a squatted house.
"We have the extremist groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as police helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or car from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were European.
But there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of "Friends of the Earth" to form the first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice."
"Today we take to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say to ourselves: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that are drying up, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which never used to be the case."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP and critic of globalisation, José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen "to combine climate justice and social justice." "Today, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organisation Oxfam has mobilised several figures, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to address the masses.
The demonstrations have been sparked by the Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to organisers.
In Manila, several hundred people, most of them students, dressed in red with bandanas, have been advertising solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organised by the "Network of 350," notably in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées.
The National Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not compulsory in the terminale (12th grade).
"Première students (11th grade) now have all four hours a week and the same program," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because, according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but on the whole a concentration of "the best students."
"The socio-economic and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued. He underlined: "Nor have I heard many historians and intellectuals outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal of technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP poll published in Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) are critical of the government's plan to scrap compulsory history and geography lessons in Year 12 at Terminal S. Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized the plan, as did the left and some on the right.
The minister replied that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of the Terminal S. programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest on Tuesday against the project, which they believe is sacrificing the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-specific aptitude examination at the beginning of the year and an admission examination at the end of the year in which their teaching skills are tested.
They also carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year in front of the pupils as teachers in the internship.
He added: "If you add all the traineeships offered before the performance test, you will achieve even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He reiterated that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts address the audience for fifteen minutes each with films.
"We want to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to know more," Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of the day, said on the sidelines of the conference. The name of the event comes from the name given by the students to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Around twenty panelists were chosen from among the experts, also according to their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about global warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking in front of about 50 people using only slides.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he said, hoping that the audience would conclude that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot at these conferences will be available online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payments: angry prison guards, actions planned
Prison officers' unions called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure bonuses and overtime pay, which has been delayed until January for budgetary reasons, are paid before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Prison Officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on the off-duty employees to demonstrate in front of the penitentiary on Tuesday morning and to block it in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to."
The Third Union of Prison Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilisation in the various prisons," branding the non-payment of overtime, night-time, Sunday and bank holiday bonuses in December as "shameful and unacceptable."
The first union of prison officers, the Autonomous Federal Union of Prisons (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilizations... to show discontent and anger."
The administration of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime in 2009 increased sharply and not all were budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
According to the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the prison officers "unions guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of staff to keep our prison system functioning and modernising," the Justice Secretary said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the penitentiary to take immediate action so that such a situation, which arose from a lack of assessment of the overtime incurred, will not be repeated in the future," Ms Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary is therefore meagre, except for the management staff, who enjoy high service and target bonuses, explains the UFAP / UNSA, for whom the "budgetary constraints" have to apply.
"This is an absolute scandal," the FO interregional trade union in Marseilles is indignant and announces that it will boycott "all meetings and conventions" until new instructions are given.
"Staff do not go to work on Sundays and public holidays when the hours of October in December are still not paid, including their overtime," threatens Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne FO.
"At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without hiring more staff, trying to enrich ourselves with the money of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less affected than others.
In any case, the UFAP Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget, observes that it is wrong.
Obama says he always gives out better gifts than he gets for Christmas.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas at the White House for the first time with his family, told TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he always gives out better presents than he gets.
In a special broadcast Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays at their new home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the party.
"Santa Claus loves Bo, too," Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama emphatically rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So please," he implored her mischievously, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this one?"
During the one-hour airing in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television host who had supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as children.
Barack Obama recalled a 10-speed bicycle and a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us one Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
'It wasn't until much later in my life that I realised I had this ball from him. '
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll's house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll's house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday undergoes another operation, confirms he has been placed in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday has undergone further surgery in Los Angeles for "significant damage" following an operation in France. According to those around him, the situation is "under control," although RTL confirms that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent another operation at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, after American doctors found "damage following surgery for a herniated disc" he suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that the damage required further surgery.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was' under control 'and said a new medical report would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it was only after 48 hours that the patient's condition was more certain when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
There was no confirmation or comment from the production company when contacted by AFP.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources" say there was "no urgency" after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a herniated disc.
The procedure, planned over several days, was carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who has treated many stars.
He was unavailable for comment to RTL on Thursday evening.
Following Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a secondary infection following the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL television on Thursday that his friend was walking through a "deep valley," but said there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician because he was "a good fighter."
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after an operation like that, it's not possible," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was "responding well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection has been contained."
Mr Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and did not feel any particular alarm.
However, concerns for the singer's health have been mounting since he spent nine days in hospital in July after crashing his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's amazement, there was talk that Johnny Hallyday had a "minor colorectal cancer operation," which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer began his long "Tour 66" as planned as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health issue has been commented on extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer struggled to move on stage.
It wasn't until mid-November that those around him had to deny being hospitalized again.
Euro 2009 / Short Course: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medallist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title over his favourite distance, the 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 short course in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of the competition, when polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a veritable flood of records was expected.
One record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in the 4 x 200m individual medley and the other two by Russia in the 4 x 50m men's individual medley.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman held his own in a final with ten swimmers (usually eight) - a first on an international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
'You can always believe in something bigger and bigger and in this case I said if the world record is within my grasp I'll try. '
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations conclude their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
This time, the combination did not pay off for Paul Biedermann of Germany, a two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and a world record holder.
The young swimmer failed to improve his personal best in the 400m freestyle (3: 32.77), but still managed to post the second best time in his career (3: 34.55), ahead of Russia's Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and Denmark's Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
'I didn't give it my all this time.
I knew I couldn't break a world record today but I defended my title and did my job. '
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA: Zola tombstone valued at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tombstone found at the home of French writer Emile Zola, of all people, was valued at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This slab is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and has always been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, which depicts "four scenes of Dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece; there are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was among hundreds of items sold.
"The sale is ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have been bidding for the most so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this piece of marble by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The plate was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
During a search of the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this slab was part of an "Emile Zola legacy" that opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico declared the terms of the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to home soil incompatible, after the latter rejected the coup as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that night, everything now seems to indicate that there is disagreement about how to carry out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Department, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the transfer of M. Zelaya, had returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and to request political asylum for him under escort abroad.
However, the ousted president refused, saying he wanted to return to Mexico as the sitting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," Mr. Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has already lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, 'the ousted president, who fled to the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, added, striking a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for escort, which unfortunately we cannot accept as it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the coup government, had told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
"I am not seeking asylum in any country," Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only be undertaken as President of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had rallied supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who had headed to and gathered around the Brazilian embassy, prompting the military there to step up its operations.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's stance.
This, he reckons, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had come close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was toppled on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had returned from his exile in Costa Rica unexpectedly on 21 September and had taken refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Coup President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
During the disputed election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until his term expired on January 27.
Wall Street on upswing, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed at a high on Thursday, and the US trade balance figures show a recovery in the share price of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones is up 0.67% and the Nasdaq is up 0.33%.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10,405.83, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, rose 7.13 points to 2,190.06.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index added 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35.
There is good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal on the premise that the market is only focused on "half-full glasses," she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are fixated on the US trade balance figures, "which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States' trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, by contrast, had expected the deficit to grow.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the United States "main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of Economy.com.
By contrast, unemployment claims in the United States rose against expectations last week, reaching 474,000.
However, the median number of new job seekers over the past four weeks "has fallen to the lowest point of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on 10-year government bonds rose to 3.482% from Tuesday night's 3.432%, while the yield on 30-year bonds rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
Several hundred partisans in power in Cuba booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for World Human Rights Day, and also thwarted another rally that led to the temporary arrest of a dozen dissidents.
About forty "ladies in white," wives or relatives of political prisoners, were booed in the street by partisans of the government of Raul Castro just as they were on foot to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the yankies!, "" Mercenaries!, "" The street belongs to the revolutionaries!, "" Fidel and Raul live! "the authorized partisans chanted with raised fists towards the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the previous evening, with no casualties or arrests.
In the Havana district of Vedado, meanwhile, a dozen dissidents who also took part in Thursday's demonstration to mark International Human Rights Day were temporarily detained by plainclothes police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents, who were booed by the partisans of the government, to get into civilian vehicles.
Temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" organised an unauthorised march for the purpose of "asking for the release of all political prisoners," the number of whom, according to the list of dissidents, is around 200, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of their avowed nemesis, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported Thursday's demonstrations between pro-government militants and "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insane man kills octogenarian with knife leaving 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) around late on Friday afternoon during rush hour.
According to the initial statements of the interrogation, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the octogenarian with two knives in or outside a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures for as yet unknown reasons, and this, according to police, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, succumbed to his injuries in hospital, according to an official of the Alliance police syndicate.
In or outside the same pharmacy, he buttoned up a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, in his 30s, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to hospital with serious injuries, where the octogenarian died.
The other injured man's life is in danger as his vital organs appear to have been affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman became nauseous as a result of the incident and was reportedly hospitalised in a 'state of shock', according to a police source.
The gunman, who police said appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is believed to have fled into the street, the same boulevard as Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently accidentally: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of whom was seriously injured.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance syndicate in the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including youths, are said to have tried to restrain the maniac, according to witness accounts obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green vest.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has descended on him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their supervisor, tried to arrest the gunman and were stabbed, police said.
The incident took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by have come up to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
"I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in a first aid position and I noticed a gaping wound in the stomach," Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, in his 30s, arrived with cuts.
State police officers eventually arrested the man, who was not carrying identification papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has entrusted the Hauts-de-Seine Criminal Police Department (SDPJ 92) with the investigation of the case.
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been questioned in court.
A police source did not rule out that he would be admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it took six officers to restrain him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" like "all mentally deranged people of this type, where the forces are released during the course of the crime."
USA: Polanski's Lawyer Calls Again for Cessation of Prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) for the prosecution of his client, who is currently on trial at his home in Switzerland for an indecent act committed more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist," testified before three judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of California about gross procedural errors dating back to 1977.
"I am calling for pardon immediately," Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "made it cold."
According to him, the - now deceased - Judge Rittenband discussed with a prosecutor, who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be imprisoned -- which constituted a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired," especially by the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
At the end of September, Mr Wells said he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to close the criminal case, Mr Hummel will ask for a trial that would allow him to present the evidence to support his argument.
For its part, the Prosecution repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the charges against the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the US in 1978, even before the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 was handed down.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the hearing."
"Do you want to spread the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but to other defendants, that escape is a way out?" asks Ms Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker is asking the court for a favor and thereby disrespecting his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to announce their decision - even pointed out that "there are other escape alternatives."
Hummel was not the only one to ask for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be dropped.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the criminal case to be dropped.
Recalling that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair, she added: "No one in this room can say that this trial was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street is being held back by the dollar's rise and is closing without a rate cut.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 at close, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq shed 0.55 points to 2,190.31.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41.
"Frankly, the market is pretty quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
'It's very limited, the volume of trade has been very low and I think it will stay that way until the end of the year. '
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators that "have helped improve market views on the soundness of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab analysts said.
In the US, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than expected.
American consumer confidence also improved markedly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index forecast.
However, the indexes have been held back by a recent rise in the value of the dollar, which has hit its highest level against the euro in two months, "putting downward pressure on sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost some ground as a result.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night, while the 30-year bond rose to 4.497% from 4.492% the previous day.
Miss World pageant returns to South Africa
After a month-long tour of South Africa, the 112 contestants for the Miss World title will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realise their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, which is being held for the second year in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already secured their tickets to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
This was a veritable whirlpool of amusement.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was simply extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had a lot of experiences, 'Miss Sierra Leone said enthusiastically.
This competition is taking place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday at 5 pm (3 pm Central European Time).
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
"I'm lucky to have had this experience twice," Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova said in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experiences with female candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes."
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and a safari, the Miss Universe pageant is now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will be present at the election, and Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about looks.
We are ambassadors for our country and I want to come home with the crown, "Miss India interjects with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
Candidates parade in traditional costumes, not to mention swimsuits.
The show will be presented by a TV presenter, Angela Chow from China, former beauty queen from South Africa Michelle McLean and a Miss World committee member, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with an unrivalled warmth and pride, says Miss World chair Julia Morley.
The candidates went on a safari, as they did last year, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time cycling and tasting the local cuisine.
But the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their best memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (South West) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way of promoting the event a little more.
I'm with people I'd probably never be able to approach otherwise.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy Alice Taticchi promised enthusiastically.
Johnny Hallyday's news is' very positive 'according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David said on Friday as he arrived at Los Angeles airport to visit his father, who has been hospitalized there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, "David Hallyday told the press as he disembarked from the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after 13: 00 local time (21: 00 CET).
The singer's son, who looked relaxed, said he would be going "as quickly as possible" to the Cedars-Sinai hospital where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial infection following surgery on a herniated disc in Paris on November 26.
The singer was placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to ease his severe pain and allow him to undergo treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was hospitalized on Monday for a bacterial infection following a disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation on Wednesday night due to the abnormal changes caused by the latest procedure.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade attends school, an AFP photographer said.
Yves Catoné, head of the orthopaedic and traumatological surgery department at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has placed a heavy strain on neurosurgeon Dr Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer at the Clinique Internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told that he had carried out the purest massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Mr. Camus said.
"I have heard there may be legal proceedings," he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday "travelled far too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke to this doctor personally on the phone, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me, as I had already had two surgeries on my intervertebral disc, he added.
Shortly before, he announced on RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without anything."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also had surgery on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a haematoma after a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations, not to mention tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical association, described him as "a man without scruples" who "regularly" had to answer for himself before the board of the chamber and was "anything but commendable."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux issued a statement Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the intervention had gone "perfectly" and post-operative examinations had been "normal."
The surgery "did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, which has been plagued by health problems since last summer, appears to be in jeopardy.
"It is quite clear that it is a bit too short to continue the tour on 8 January (in Amiens)," Mr Camus said.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) is becoming vigorous and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The alliance of parties overseen by François Bayrou's MoDem party reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt by Hervé Morin, leader of the Nouveau Centre party, to take over the label, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and called on him not to use it on any document, threatening legal action.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, believing that François Bayrou, having reached out to the left, would not be worthy of defending this political legacy.
The defence minister, whose party partner is the UMP, also wanted to reaffirm this strategy in front of the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
To reinforce his efforts, he had received the support of Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC), who is claiming ownership of the UDF trademark, since he was the first to apply for it at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle in 2004.
However, the head office of the UDF, which was supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they would not allow themselves to be expropriated and, under threat of legal action, gave the Minister and the Member of Parliament a deadline to stop using the seal and to transfer the trademark's property rights.
In recent days, you have made numerous declarations that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal +, the alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogan + of today's UDF +, printed on your political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, stated the UDF office, and urges the NC party to "immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material and from (its) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's proprietary rights to its legal entitlements."
If you refuse, we will take legal action against you to enforce the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the UMP party.
The Nouveau Centre party therefore, according to the undersigned, has no rights whatsoever to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "by the time he applied for the trademark, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He profits scandalously and fraudulently, from the absence of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you point out that this ruthlessness is on its way to becoming a criminal offence, and you ironically echo the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us more dignified in politics, as in life, to make a name for oneself, instead of trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently appropriating a name to which you have no legal entitlement."
Liliane Bettencourt affair: François-Marie Banier convicted of exploiting weakness
The Nanterre Court of Justice decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he exploited a vulnerable moment in her 80s to steal part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will stand trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 on charges of exploitation of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair, worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are at loggerheads while at the same time holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
Likewise, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which was carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and major shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions submitted by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they will clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo that investigation.
"I will talk to her," Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As far as Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who needs to be protected, he affirmed.
For the past two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years to conceal gifts totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to consider the admissibility of the lawsuit filed by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaintiffs "lawyers on Friday led to a major family debacle.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers "husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
I haven't been able to speak to Françoise since she got married. '
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially as a guardian judge has in recent days rejected her request to initiate legal protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full legal capacity, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place, "said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a representative of the prosecutor's office.
The Court has now decided to issue a judgment following the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Reconnaissance?
If nothing changes in the leadership of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of management of large companies with respect to its employees, said the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: It is intended for staff to join "values" the best, as it used to impose on consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors customer preferences again regularly!
A demobilisation of the employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon affecting employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly those of R & D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique) demands "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it demands from its staff a commitment that is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would involve putting employees at the heart of the company's concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very limited usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its wage earners, inspire this revolution in management practice?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- Firstly, because I was able to see that, faced with a new situation, after many detours, the whole fabric is finally beginning to do what it has always done... as a matter of priority.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - is increasing in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplistic idea of human behavior.
Emanating from the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory recently reactivated by the US "neuroscience" and unwittingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) to engage employees, a recent Ipsos poll published in Le Figaro.fr encourages managers to adopt an attitude to a mechanistic management system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a business revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol into every thought or practice of management: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible when it clearly appears to be a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
At the moment, only studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of motivating employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a pre-defined Doxa, which, through their perceived image of the company, allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict, and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create fertile soil conducive to the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: 'Just war' earns Obama praise from right
The American right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who mocked the award to Obama on October 9 applauded the president's speech this time, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party, told USA Today, adding that she herself raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her just-published memoir.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
"We have to stop the terrorists down there," she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, sought Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was very good indeed, exulted the former President of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts of the country, the speech was seen as historic, said Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former lawmaker, seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "president of the left" who reminded Nobel committee members that they "are not free and cannot hand out a prize for peace if the use of force does not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former writer for George W. Bush and now an editor at the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he spoke "like an American president," pointing out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they didn't create and that they don't do much to protect," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era hawk, called the speech on the National Review Online website "dull, pompous, and uninspiring."
To the president's left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich expressed concern about the way Barack Obama is defending the use of the armed forces.
If the war is waged under the guise of justice, he warns, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified.
The center-left press, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the speech a "monumental work" even for a speaker like him known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "provides a blueprint for guiding international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily writes enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse," calling his speech "somber and exemplary at the same time."
Truck drivers: Three marathons for a deal that secures Christmas supplies
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the unions of the Road Workers Union and the TLF - the only employers "organisation remaining to the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike order and the threat of severe supply shortages at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, Dominique Bussereau, State Secretary for Transport, "welcomed" the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, negotiators parted ways early Friday morning in hopes of quickly signing the agreement by late morning.
This was despite the fact that the three employers "associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting outraged.
However, more than six hours went by from the start of the meeting at 11: 00 to the conclusion of the agreement, and it was not until 18: 00 that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to businesses" and "it was feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers on the lowest wages will therefore rise from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"It's not much, but we start small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not happy with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to concede these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low wage groups and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for workers," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "an historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said it was "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, in particular, to address the issue of thirteenth-month salaries and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes for employers amounting to 100 million euros" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill on corrected finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government is demanding "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated with this organisation and then, if extended by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time," assures Bussereau.
Opposition from employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade," because the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to annoy the goose-eaters on the approaching Christmas Day, laments Unostra.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens to "dig a big grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months."
Line RER A: Disruption this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France serving Greater Paris and Île-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of strikes between the unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), continues to keep strikers waiting with their demands for extra pay.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains running between 10: 00 and 20: 00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was operational and outside the central line only one of four trains was operational.
The connection to SNCF trains was interrupted at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the major stores with transport."
The RER A line crosses the Paris conurbation from west to east.
The RATP route links the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran on schedule during rush hour, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there were no crowds on the platforms as the inhabitants of Île-de-France prepared for the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the shortage of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29, an engineer, said he had "got up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
SNCF, which had planned for staff and law enforcement to attend to passengers, said there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to be connected to the metro.
Strikers "general meetings were held again on Saturday and Sunday, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had described as" poor "after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long overdue wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself was putting its wage surcharge proposals in parentheses, stressing that the management was "unable to solve a problem when it was possible for long-distance drivers and SNCF to do so."
The RATP made clear that another meeting to "fully review working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company is "ignoring the weekend drivers."
In the morning, about 150 riders visited the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, suggesting a meeting after the situation has calmed down.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line, following a preliminary announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which is used by millions of travellers every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift work as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish constitutional court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate enormously the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Constitutional Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were barred from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
Party leaders said before the verdict that MPs would rather leave parliament than sit like non-party MPs.
The decision followed a case initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers "Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the PKK rebels "legal political showcase.
The party claims to have "no connection" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling by the Constitutional Court comes on the heels of the government's efforts to accommodate the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to drain Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP affirm that a resolution could lead to a resumption of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the metropolis of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
Police used tear gas grenades and water cannons as protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said he expected the court's decision to "deepen the despair even further."
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish issue) by banning one party," he told the press.
The government, made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
That will not solve the problems, "said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo on the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"You can obviously expect a response from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The onset of snow may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Rather, so that its employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
It could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-sections will be covered with large-scale gritters, Brauburger explains.
These include major roads and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigade access roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be sprinkled with moist salt, which adheres better, in a maximum of three hours.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until rush hour."
It gets difficult when it snows only at 7.30am.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then nobody is prepared to make room for the gritters."
Only then, if it does not continue to snow, will it be the turn of feeder roads and access roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
Side streets and side streets are the last priority.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the pedestrians of the FES set off, danger points and crossings are cleared as a matter of priority.
The FES can usually not take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4: 30 a.m., Brauburger says.
Since it is quickly slippery on these, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on its way.
He said police would also be called if necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two meter long and 1.5 meter tall animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report Thursday in the journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the relationships, dispersal and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We've sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for Triassic deposits, said team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some of the bones as new.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Finding confirms theories about dinosaur prehistory
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, mostly only individual fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts don't necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the classification of these primordial dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, experts are debating when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and the birds, the four-legged sauropods and their relatives known as "long necks," and the herbivorous ornithischia, which included the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced features, says Nesbitt.
In the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, similar to those of the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lineage of the giant sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, it is likely that the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development separated very early and spread from South America over all continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangaea.
This is supported by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn-based paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could arise, because in South America there are simply a lot of primitive dino fossils preserved, while on other continents hardly anything is to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs, and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border of the Triassic and Jurassic became extinct.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this shift, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted to beat the competition from the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to blossom, which had also developed in the Triassic and had been living in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California are on it.
There are lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the squatted casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America, express their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "deplore" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike evacuated last week because walls and artworks had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, according to the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organised courses by students and lecturers by a police command."
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau had evaded the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the squatters did not support the property damage, it said.
Legitimised protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for their own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Meanwhile, Hesse's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a news conference on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We have understanding for the protest, but no understanding for vandalism, so the CDU state parliament member Peter Beuth.
The opposition groups SPD, Greens and Left took a different view.
The CDU is using painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they were evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a heavily guarded site for secret armaments research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the commune with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as "Russian Silicon Valley."
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had already established contacts with the Frankfurt science centre Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several reciprocal visits, and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on Closer Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Deputy Mayor of Moscow Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, while Planning Minister Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a question of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to win contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large corporations Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The Commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") got its name from the wooded hills in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake pad
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be overstated.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe."
Quite so. S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg capital into utter construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with tracks that end in the middle of the city were considered transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brake blocks of modern rail transport, because it once took an enormous amount of time to rearrange locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive in, keep short, keep driving - that's how it should be.
And that's why the terminals should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located about half way along the trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan "Heart of Europe."
S21 is indeed being tackled now, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian cities to implement lowering.
Terminals, however, no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turning trains with locomotives and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE line to Ulm is now being tackled.
State and local politicians have pushed it through.
Rail participates, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by taxpayers and not by state corporations.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is being created, which - if the computer-generated graphics of the planners are to be believed - will be furnished with plenty of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, which - typically in the 80s - was credited with huge growth.
Back then, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
Modern transport policy must, however, first and foremost focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of steep gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are to be bundled up in Swabian.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion is realistic.
What is certain is that the next decade will see a lack of money at other intersections and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine valley.
Construction on the line has been slow-motion since 1987.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube correctly here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley line is becoming a bottleneck for international freight traffic: right in the heart of Europe.
Government to review airport ruling
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will appeal against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU / FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of the VGH verdict legally examined, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had justified in writing that day that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23: 00 and 5: 00, as envisaged by the state government, is incompatible with the statutory protection of the population from nocturnal aircraft noise.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to appeal the ruling.
The opposition criticised this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from appealing to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises to ban night flights, otherwise it would be a "breach of word."
It is damn hard to keep your word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schaefer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government was still trying to get to its night flights by "twisting the law and trickery."
A thorough legal review would take time.
He said the coalition would not operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally sound decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His group's statements on the night flight ban were never the same as those of the opposition.
US banks pay back aid
Crisis-hit US big banks are stripping themselves of their government shackles.
Bank of America on Wednesday repaid a total of 45 billion dollars (just over 30 billion euros) in aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in one fell swoop.
Citigroup also plans to return the government aid, according to a report by US broadcaster CNBC.
Institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with accepting the money - such as limits on the payment of executive bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised about $19 billion in fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
It took the rest of the sum from its own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by division sales.
Bank chief executive Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening, saying the cash injection had helped through a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the money house took over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also plans to raise money on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities to the state.
The US bank could announce a roughly $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid in June.
Quick Choice
It all happened faster than we thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster is able to present a successor.
Last night, the panel was due to vote on the staffing bill.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was considered the favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, so as not to pre-empt the proceedings.
However, it is also likely that a role was played in not further damaging ZDF Artistic Director Markus Schächter should this proposal also not get through the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote had not yet been determined at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for a further five years.
Only seven members spoke in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter defeat for Schächter, but one that was to be expected.
The Union majority in the Administrative Council had already signalled weeks before the election that it would not confirm Brender in office.
The Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief.
With the argument that under Brender the news programs of the ZDF had lost in ratings, he rejected a further term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Recently, as many as 35 civil rights advocates had weighed in on the debate, calling Koch's actions unconstitutional.
It didn't help.

Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Politics, Pedagogy and Romance Languages and Literatures.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "heute-journal."
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal assistant to the editor-in-chief; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of ZDF's Hauptstadtstudio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after Brender, who was voted journalist of the year on Wednesday by the industry newspaper Medium Magazin, was voted out of office.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, Kurt Beck, the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, declared last week that the states should amend the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the director's personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck, however, also ruled out an exodus of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies.
Brender's prospective successor, Peter Frey, had made a smart move in recommending himself to the Board of Directors - by fiercely criticising the Board immediately after Brender was removed from office.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the board of directors was able to elect him without suspecting that he was a partisan.
In the party arithmetic Frey is already attributed to the left liberals.
Study gets off the ground
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strikes, the Education Ministers of the Länder finally relented on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Education and Rectors "Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for bachelor and master's degrees.
Students should be able to complete their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
It will also review students "workloads and ensure" a realistic and justifiable level. "
Politicians and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's courses more flexible.
Furthermore, there should be no derogations from national rules.
Fewer tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university rectors have been saying the same thing about better student access.
Now, for the first time, it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in some cases: "As a rule, each module concludes with only one examination," states a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of courses of study.
Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Council, said that the "significant reduction of the examination burden" was intended to put a stop to a "deviation that significantly impaired the ability to study."
In addition, "studiability" will in future be "the decisive criterion" in design.
Modules such as content must be "rigorously checked" to ensure that "unnecessary constraints are placed on students" choice of
events "would be avoided.
Students would be "entitled to have leeway that enables and encourages personal initiative."
The rules will apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the review of existing ones.
These must be "re-accredited" every five years - but this means that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies across Germany are responsible for this, which are subject to the accreditation council set up by the Länder.
In October, the culture ministers had "emphatically" urged the Länder to exert influence on the agencies in such a way that the quantity of material was not too large and the testing regime was not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country so far to pledge additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
Higher education institutions are to use the money primarily to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen student advisory services as well as examination and international offices.
The state and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
According to this, only one exam is required for the completion of a study model.
Degree arrangements are to be made more flexible, recognition of qualifications at other universities is to be ensured and access to the Master's degree is to be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country are to be examined for their suitability for study.
Government and opposition clashed again on Thursday over student conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups called for the formation of education policy to cease to take place "behind closed doors" between ministers and university rectors.
After the education strikes at the latest, students should now also have a say as those affected.
Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Education and Science Trade Union (GEW) believes that the Bonn resolutions do not go far enough: They call for a legal entitlement that would allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a postgraduate master's course.
On the other hand, the Länder must ensure that sufficient Master's degree places with the best possible study conditions are available for the current generation of bachelor students tomorrow, according to GEW Executive Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not comment on freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
... "reads the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses, in disturbing fragments of language, the experience of arrival of a dissident who has won freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic space.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor at a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary sensation last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorted mirror of its security files."
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read out a statement in which he confessed his involvement as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize in 1989.
The attempts to recruit had begun creepily, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "someone who has not resisted enough attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary exploration of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of Romanian-born German authors, has been shaken by a case that highlights the abysses and villainy of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know so far, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
After Söllner's confession, the literary scholar Michael Markel said that IM Walter had played a role in his Securitate file and pointed to the positive influence that IM Walter had on him.
Markel said that he had "cut him out" on all points that were difficult for him at the time.
He felt a moral need to make that remark.
Söllner's explanation was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate informants, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, one may assume, will have speculated and in some cases probably also known which clear name was hiding behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
In contrast to the now very reliable screening of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic enlightenment has been thwarted and obstructed in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS), which corresponds to the Birthler authority, was only founded in 1999, but the publication of the files has been rather sluggish since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the administration of the files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former head of the Securitate in Timisoara made derogatory comments about the laureate proved that the influence of former Securitate members is still very great in Romania.
She had a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as is so often the case with concealed guilt, the Söllner case raises inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The level-headed reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a thirst for knowledge rather than by apportioning blame and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a neatly dressed sales representative had just returned from a very nice Christmas party at which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier, climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight. ¨
The man with the distinctive bald head let himself be chauffeured because the city was still foreign to him.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and neither was the 55-year-old.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work just continues.
Or really get going.
In the words of the Swiss, who had signed only three days earlier: "We have reached the last eight," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be dazzled by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against relegation."
The "much more important task" lies ahead on Sunday, he said.
Then it is important to repeat the top-class performance in everyday league life in Mainz.
And to remedy the weaknesses that were once again revealed after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The last eight of the Champions League (first leg 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / second leg 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy at the brilliant debut of the Babbel successor remained subdued.
Not only with the supposed saviour, who had imparted self-confidence, commitment and joy of playing to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be braver, Gross explained, explaining the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under Babbel.
He has created a certain magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes into football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who immediately became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamism after weeks out through injury, tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" with the proverbial "breath of fresh air" and the working method of the new manager: "He is a man who perseveres and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation. '
Under Babbel, this was evidently lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not out of the woods yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all.
Like Gross, players and managers were wary of overestimating the victory against a weakened and overwhelmed Romanian defence.
They had also won in Glasgow before the bad awakening in Leverkusen four days later, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We're not out of the woods yet.
The fact that Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which came to life in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the match.
"There are decisions that others make, not Jens," Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and decided to change coaches under pressure from fans.
Lehmann also took the fact that his day off after matches had been cancelled as a sign of a lack of confidence and resentment.
Lehmann's comments were "characterised by pure selfishness," Heldt wedged back and announced consequences for the netminder.
They're not going to be friends for life any more, the two 40-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team the playful and combative strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants "played a big part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison - and even the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Hot duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 gruelling rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The judgement of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points (120-108, 120-108, 119-109) in Berne on Saturday night.
It was Klitschko's third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian previously held the WBO and WBC world titles twice.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out for the knockout that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to concede defeat due to injury.
Challenger Johnson suffered his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, who is 2.02 metres tall, wanted to dictate the fight primarily with his left hand.
The eleven centimetre shorter Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly eluded the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous right to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to go the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused quite a stir before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
At the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was then provoked to push his sunglasses off Johnson's nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko remained victorious in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years out, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and reclaimed "his" WBC belt, which he had previously surrendered without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in his title defense.
I only got one punch in that fight and I'm in great shape physically, 'Klitschko said of his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four major titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the WBO and IBF world champion.
But Britain's David Haye holds the WBA belt after dethroning 6ft 3in Nikolai Valuev in November.
Haye had previously called off a fight against Vitali Klitschko, scheduled for September, in the summer.
His promoter is reportedly already planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Case of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left are demanding clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the latest findings on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately deceiving the public.
The minister had "knowingly told the untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tanker trucks in September, said Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau."
It's commonly called: He lied.
The order to kill was given in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air strike requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately address the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Federal Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm emphatically rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not have any influence on specific Bundeswehr operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also expressed about the ministry's account of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to Spiegel, the two Guttenberg men provided correct and complete information about the background to the truck attack.
Officially, they were said to have denied the existence of the Nato reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
But sources close to the two top officials said they had even alerted the Department of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document from the commanding colonel and a fielding report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung."
He has not yet received a response, it said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday, pointing out that this would be clarified by the parliamentary committee of inquiry, which is due to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
Some see images when awake and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are not only blurred in the case of the mentally ill and in drug intoxication.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are free to indulge in the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
Whoever experiences dream-like states while awake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is generally regarded in the modern Western world as crazy or addicted to drugs, or at least as an eccentric.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, delusion, and reality.
Dreamlike altered states of wakefulness can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic raptures, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain's neuronal messengers - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in an awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of insanity with dream states," and for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all its inconsistencies, delusions, and delusions of the senses."
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a cartoon character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-colored.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted grimaces, gnashing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo, ties them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a loudspeaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jumps.
The noose loosens.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices scream in an eardrum-shattering chorus, "Go to the clinic and be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
"During my psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair," he says.
The Mirages are Cruel Reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and psychiatric hospitals treat it as the second most common condition after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers are usually no longer able to distinguish between the inner and outer world, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationships or persecution.
Particularly common is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of the action, everything has a meaning directed towards him.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, as in a dream, overwhelmed by what is happening and unable to actively shape it.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
A reality check is usually not possible for them, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in dreams, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, is fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place within the real framework.
Exactly why our brains strike such a chord is still a mystery to researchers.
Emergency situations can cause any person to temporarily lose touch with reality, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers believe there is minimal brain damage in sufferers.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neural system comes about, which moreover does not manifest itself at all at first for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also cause psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether miraculous images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory phenomena for ten years, and last year he analyzed his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Mind."
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of an astonishing number of other illnesses.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even healthy people's brains hallucinate under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, Kasten said, are made up of memory contents that are normally retained.
They arise when areas of the brain where sensory perception is processed are overactive or inhibited too little; when our brain is running hot or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also attraction, stress, lovesickness or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old. She lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends grammar school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it were not for the images and voices.
During the break it can happen that a lanky boy with long, dark hair responds to it.
When he replies, his classmates look at him in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They consider the shy girl to be a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other mirages are not real and will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are mostly scary
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she is sitting in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the subject matter, because the teacher is introducing a new classmate to her eyes and ears, while he is explaining mathematical equations audibly and visibly to everyone else on the blackboard.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes far too rarely and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, are created in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she shouts at the creatures.
She doesn't tell parents or friends about it, they think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist on the internet, she knows full well that she's not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimuli, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect the brain is then underemployed and provides its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Dad has not been her biological father for as long as she can remember.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, sufferers such as Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "takes place in the brain, where reality is depicted.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real. "
Kasten also regards nocturnal dream images as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy are able to recognize their illusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to also value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our too consciousness-centered world, imaginary experience is unfortunately most often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, distressing illness, but it also contains positive, creative things - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-like altered wakefulness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced person considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish retrospectively from the waking state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in traumatic or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a person is threatened by loss of self and world, for example by persistent, complete immobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation in reality is not possible, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is made present in the imagination.
An intensive form of generating meaning and making sense in an intrinsically unbearable situation, which enables us humans to create our own ability not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue operation for the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to mobility in intensive care.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
In the early Middle Ages, he lived among nobles who manufactured drugs from blood.
Abducted by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, surfing in the firn snow of the Alps with his hospital bed and meeting a Korean mafioso.
It is completely absorbed in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
In complete contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in incidental details.
More clearly and more intensely even than what was really experienced.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are even when awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.

Burda
Children to take over publishing company at 27
The new head of the publishing house Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to hand over his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be 100 percent owned by the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and are determined to join the company, the 69-year-old told Der Spiegel.
We have arranged the details of this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
There is also the question of whether they are capable of doing so.
You can't put your children in front of you if they are not sufficiently capable.
This is killing the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will step down as CEO in January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, responsibility for corporate assets was added to the Treasury division, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, responsibility for direct marketing, foreign affairs, printing and finance was added.
For the first time, no family member is at the helm of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Naming Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
The holding company should continue to be 100 percent owned by the family, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from demise: "This always concerned families who were infected by a thirst for capital, who had completely speculated and thought that this would enable them to become a very big player.
It was never my strategy.
He had "never had dreams of world power," according to Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play in the world league with Time, these stores have grown too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
That, at least, is what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, having recently opened a shop of more than 1000 m ² in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal hygiene.
The wellness area, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provides laser depilation; Spaxión, with spaces for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym and L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food section, which stands out for its tea house with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoying a relaxing massage with your partner while enjoying a fantastic view of the capital city, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the Jacuzzi or with massages and a glass of champagne are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m ², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as hydro-therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers that take care of clients "workouts, giving them a completely personalised workout.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen opposite the equipment.
Afterwards, different videos show you how to do your workouts correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) is completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have worked out your body, you want to stop by the hair salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments are offered in a personalised way to restore the splendour, shine and health of your hair.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this spa in the heart of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most varied necklines
Christmas is fast approaching, so it's a good opportunity to copy the looks of the stars and get their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points to consider.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie has opted for an exaggerated and very intricate neckline, but that is not to be discouraged.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office."
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote the electric car and is intended to summarize opinions and measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of electric cars.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative Endesa is participating in to promote the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a calm horizon" for the automotive sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts "a calm horizon" for the Spanish car industry, which is the country's biggest exporter.
During the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero reiterated the measures taken by the Government to support the automotive sector during the year in office.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would now have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," declared the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to continue producing in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export sector," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), allocated 800 million euros to projects by 19 car manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn generated investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the measures taken by the government to stimulate demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, which will be implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
Madrid will host the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a specially designed racetrack outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine on the Mazda3 model, christened the i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation Mazdas 3 stands out for its good marks on the overall picture.
The finish, the workmanship of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and dashboard, you can see that Mazda is in line with the Japanese trend for a futuristic interior design with a multitude of buttons and switches in the eye-catching red and blue colours.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
It is therefore safe to say that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more comfort than ever before, so that four adults can travel very comfortably by car.
All this is complemented by a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this petrol-powered i-Stop for its great comfort in gearing and its low fuel consumption, even though Mazda's best-selling diesel models are the ones in particular.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model, which was chosen for a test drive, is special because it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
Standard features include Lane Change Assist (RVM), which eliminates the blind spot, traction and stability controls, cruise control, light-sensitive interior mirror, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and 17-inch chrome wheels.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which for an additional 1,500 euros includes the following: among other elements, especially the Bixenon headlights, which are capable of learning, and the BOSE sound system with CD loader.
Verdict
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its rather high price, which ranges from 21,770 euros for the Luxury model to 23,270 euros for the tried-and-tested Sportive model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pleasure every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine," the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, beamed more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that allows you to read only your e-mails without being able to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example only half the price of an iPhone's flat rate.
After seeing its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, and the other with a free lifetime data service, unlike the Peek, which costs six times as much.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limitations as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise in store.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read your emails as soon as you cross the border, or when you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flat rate roaming is incredibly tempting and should have been possible a long time ago.
It is true that some telephone companies already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you need a PhD in physics and good glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticisms of affordable roaming rates across Europe have almost always gone unheeded.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, even though it does not have Wifi / WLAN) can offer this kind of tariff means that telephone providers need to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example, its prices include downloading books and other inquiries on the Internet.
Without contract and without hook.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, when you buy it, and not month by month.
And this is exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchasing opportunity with lifelong Internet access like the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect it because I think it would be a better model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to be able to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the American First Lady's favorite color.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of that color and chose the same color again to accompany him at what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a glossy green-yellow - the dress consisted of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore something large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and, in Oslo, a patterned velvet one.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with mid-high heels and the second time a similar model, but gold.
The hairstyle was also different every time: on this occasion, her hair was pinned up as a wreath, on the previous occasion she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have experienced problems at work because of motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain," carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited due to motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and, if so, what kind of job they do.
Those who do not do any other work outside the home, work part-time or have no fixed contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
By contrast, women with permanent jobs, especially in the public sector, postpone starting a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the 35-49 age group with a permanent job do not have their first child on average until 3.7 years after they have moved in, a figure that rises to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only realised their contraction and first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of conception readiness, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account when women get married and have their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be observed in women of the same age.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, women became first-time mothers at 25.1 and 32.1, on average, depending on whether they only completed lower secondary school or higher education.
Furthermore, there is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
Whereas women with a high school diploma get married before their first permanent job and have their first child, women with a middle or high school diploma do it the other way around, first looking for a permanent job and then getting married and then having their first child, notes Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it, too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envied list of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it."
The leading actress of "Joyeux Noël," one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead, like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz before her.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (fellow actor of Evangeline in "Lost").
The awards ceremony for the British fashion industry
The British have an important say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - gathered at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all turned up for the occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, images by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an analogy to the ardent heart of the creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares no terror or enlightenment.
In addition to being a delicious pleasure to read, this book is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "Reading his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual urge, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: joy as opposed to calamitous destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunningly poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the knife blade that nearly killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was so captivated by this woman with a passion that went on for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were combined with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in going to Heaven in the detour of perdition."
About James Joyce: "Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000-metre peaks in the world literature, you have to climb up the north face, the wall where the best climbers keep trying. "
On William Faulkner: "He was a funny chap.
Sometimes he said about himself that he was the heir of a county landowner, and other times he said that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of a certain size. ""
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: this writer recorded the mad cry shouted from a bridge by that figure from Munich, so that its echo resonated deep into the night of the twentieth century in his literary way, on a journey during which he fled from himself and implored posterity with a speech full of violence in front of the worms.
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and said," My dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power to finally stop writing like a woman. "
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'sleep after exertion, / after the thunderstorm of the harbor, / the rest after war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death.'
On Virginia Wolf: "She always carried her depression with her.
The husband took it perfectly normal when she told him that Edward VII spied on her between azaleas or sang the birds in Greek.
There is not a single known case where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was even greater than her craziness. "
On Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do but try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet's intention if he did not bring Baroja up to Faulkner's arms?
What did Cela do but destroy the glory of that man so that he could put himself on that pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age walked next to her and our dog, our dog is a mongrel that we got from the shelter and that weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they kicked him twice, seriously injuring him.
Our indignation cannot be expressed in words, because we cannot understand where the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
Add to this the asphyxiation that a woman who was going for a leisurely walk suffered when she tried to reprimand them for the incident, even fearing for her own life, because if such a maniac attacks a dog, he will probably do the same to a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman, or probably even to anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood around 5 p.m. on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog was crying all day long.
Of course, we reported it to a nearby police station, but we have serious doubts as to whether it will make any difference at all and, in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just like to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, it was announced today by both companies.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of helmet use, which is, after all, the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which involves "much more than just designing and manufacturing products that are getting safer every day," and reiterated that they are also helping to bring this goal one step closer every day with other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will initially distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in order to maximise their dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" for the company, precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, it is always committed to ensuring that one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sales of light trucks are on the rise again
After almost two years, the vans market is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, it is the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Association of Manufacturers Anfac and the Association of Car Dealers Ganvam.
These good figures are, however, to be enjoyed with great caution at the moment, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year for sales, with a fall of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total approvals for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the vans market: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and light trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, there are still the same storm clouds in the sky, which affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make purchases with third-party financing.
Thus, in addition to these constraints, which are the result of the turned off money supply of the credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama, and in contrast to cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of Plan 2000E did little to help.
However, this plan is not only aimed at individuals, the self-employed and small businesses are also entitled to it if they want to buy a van of up to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam reminded us that it is essential for the State to pay special attention to these vans and, of course, also to industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The Automobile Dealers Association predicts a similar year in 2010 to the one just past, for which it expects a 19% drop in sales (for passenger cars and SUVs).
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time, and as is currently the case with the ESP stability control system, emergency braking systems must become compulsory in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, with a waiting period until the end of February 2011 for the remaining vehicles.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems, due to their functioning, can also help to prevent many rear-end collisions.
The role of the emergency brake assist is to apply more pressure to the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the braking force applied by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure to the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even manage to press the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not braked fully.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during braking.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatal accidents could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents involving personal injury is expected to be prevented - once so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, applying a slight pressure on the brakes at the same time.
When the driver responds, the system helps him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning, and even if the collision is already inevitable, the Brake Assist exerts maximum pressure on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors postpones Opel plan until January
While Opel workers at the Figueruelas (Zaragoza) plant have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American carmaker indicates that it needs more time to finalize the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the parties concerned to give their consent in advance to every single point of the plan.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, may be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits it is in touch with some potential new buyers.
One such buyer could be Geely, which would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing popularity.
If no agreement is reached with either buyer, GM could sell some assets to China's BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
Behind the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis, but managed to make it 80 kilograms lighter, bringing it down to just 1,275 kilograms.
In order to achieve this, the first thing they did was to do without the automatic hinged roof, which was replaced by a canvas roof with manual drive, which alone saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15 "disappeared"; with the removal of the air conditioning, another 13; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, saving a further 7 kilos; with the installation of sporty Bacquet seats, another 12 and with the light 19-inch rims, another five were saved.
Then, by dispensing with the CDR-30 audio system, they had lost another six kilos, and by replacing the door handles with fabric handles, they had achieved the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch gearbox, the test drive was done with a 6-speed manual gearbox, mainly on the smaller California highways, on mountain stretches that were really very winding.
With his driving you can only give him the mark impeccable.
However, the reduction in his weight has not in any way resulted in him not being so safe on the road any more.
In fact, the opposite is the case: we haven't tried such a small and light model for a long time, but at the same time it gives you a feeling of great safety when cornering, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to speed, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything we tell him, the car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of its 320 bhp V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is extremely successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time on the Panamera.
The acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or speeding up again.
Suspension is strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads where we drove the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car coped well with the potholes.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track, even though we found ice at dawn on some of these corners and a bit of grit in the morning.
In summary, it is an ultralight car, a car with which you can have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is usually rather rare, and there is much more to it than just a small improvement on the Boxster S.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.

The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', presenting her evil face with the same stubbornness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "bag girl."
Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, in spite of the many unusual players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra, thus taking first place in his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant retirements of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the Blue Reds leading the way from the outset on the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the Vitoria team had already come out of the perimeter, you could already guess that they had come onto the pitch with their wrists warmed up.
It was English and Teletovic who were mostly responsible for making it 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the Álava team opted for an inward play by Barac and for the play of Eliyahu, who on his return to the team was greeted with whistles and applause, which is his home, to extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating from Splitter suggested that this would not be the Brazilian's best night.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage at the break, the match was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their pitch, and thanks to the ever-attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were instrumental in turning the "Yellow" around (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but far from dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy in order to regain some breathing space and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who, with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, ensured that the scoreboard showed a reassuring gap of (54-67), which the hosts were able to embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were exposed in the final quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, even though Splitter was sent off for fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and even though the Israelis were catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from challenging
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, in a game marked by the failures of the Unicajas players (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their play in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the match, even though the home team managed to turn the scoreboard in their favour 22-20 in the 13th minute with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, the minute when an action almost resulted in a brawl between Beverley and Williams, both Americans, which resulted in both being disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and show their superiority in both halves of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to injury and the three self-inflicted errors of Carlos Jiménez left their mark on Unicaja.
Among their infield players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage to 44-32 in the 19th minute.
Catching up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, showed itself superior and even managed to make up the difference of the match played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the lead within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to make light of the many retirements and retirements of Scot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, some hope was restored in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and triples from Cook and the efforts of Lewis.
Even so, it was actually impossible because Olympiacos, once they attacked and showed their superiority with centimetres within the basket area, were unstoppable.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic made it 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja were forced to concede defeat and surrender the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out the salary they should earn based on their profile thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with the highest number of ads for real estate, jobs and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job openings available at Trovit in Spain. Users have access to a form on Facebook where they can enter their occupation, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Just one week after the application became available for the first time, the search engine found that the average Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the Trovit product, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the lowest paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a lorry driver has a net annual salary of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net a year, followed by that of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched posts on the internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time workers and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the embassy, where he had found asylum since September 21, before that date.
'He's aware that he has to leave on January 27 because his mandate expires on that day and he has to find a new place to live. '
The station also quoted the ex-president confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was declared the winner), Zelaya pledged that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he sought refuge in Brazil.
But this failed because of Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician that the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is hardly surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers are making decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle debts by buying assets directly and indirectly giving liquidity a free hand with interest rates hovering around zero, so that banks could buy assets for settlement.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are all but over and, without calling into question their heterodox liquidity policies, are beginning to throw some sand in the gears, as the BCE has already done with its annual auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
Governments have been forced to nationalize private risk, and public debt is rising again.
The focus is now on quality again, and the US, Japan, and Germany are investors "preferred havens, which in turn widens the differences between eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain has so far been little affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's, threatening a new downgrade of Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does no harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to make world economic policy makers aware of what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of credit had on job losses, when they should have decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and developments in Greece have been foreseen before.
A government that conceals the national debt, elections and a new government that pulls together.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary at the beginning of the year from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments, thereby allowing a euro member state to default on its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, facing an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after a few excesses to excessive amounts, which would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as sovereign-debt differentials increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
If, however, the European differences were to diminish and the Spanish were to increase further, this would be a specific Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's "s is a farce, and while the early indicators here are forcing a large number of market research institutions to bring forward their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are again coming up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise long lifespans, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution is the order of the day."
Connected branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy for Spain's energy supply over the next two decades is being debated.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, provided, of course, that other "support energies" are used.
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy that has just been adopted by the government is in line with what his company has called for, certainly did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, we are clearly moving in this direction, despite what the chairman of Iberdrola described as some" individual "measures.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made now, as it will take time and a stable remuneration framework must be put in place to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets Aer Lingus "handling" at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport of Switzerland, is the preferred baggage service partner of Aer Lingus of Ireland at ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, is for a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol of cooperation aimed at creating an innovation centre for smart infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million euros by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway in Australia
Acciona is fighting for approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which it already operates as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and Germany's Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and motorway operator in the country.
The municipality wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After opting for a public-private partnership (PPP is the English abbreviation) to move the project forward on the basis of a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for construction and tollbooth management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly made up of European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
Acciona's team will be pitted against the Northern Direct consortium composed of the British company Laing O'Rourke, Australia's Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure, and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final shortlisted consortium is LBRJV, made up of the capital of Australia's Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn is part of ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public works.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisation, but has a hurdle to overcome, as access can only be gained through the purchase of a local developer.
A strategy that the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, have followed, and which the Spanish construction giants have yet to pursue.
Even ACS only entered this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions in assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of the utmost importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies contracted to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of $700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to exploit these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority and called the Northern Link, will link the western motorway at Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) for 5 kilometres through tunnels, the largest congestion reduction measure on Brisbane's roads.
The timetable issued by the municipality foresees the award of the contract for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll road is already scheduled to open to traffic in the final months of 2014, it is expected that construction will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll collection system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the funding.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is big business.
Australia continues to award sizeable contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a $154 million contract with the government.
ACS, through its domestic subsidiary Leighton, will improve the infrastructure of the domestic fibre-optic broadband network.
This improvement will provide high-speed internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million euros for it.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it is also competing with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools over a period of 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC awarded contract for 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has secured the construction of a 2.1 kilometre tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract just a few days after winning the contract for the construction of the 130 million extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria.
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnelling.
Construction is scheduled to begin at the beginning of 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for the sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two renewals of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves in this competition, of which 4 were finalists, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined 63 million euros for slowing down its competitors.
France's competition regulator has fined France Télécom €63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in its Caribbean territories.
According to the authority, the telephone operator has reduced competition in fixed and mobile networks by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the fringes of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased because the authority that oversees competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenues from non-telephone transactions.
Basically, this Orange application site is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 for this service to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League has brought in £476.4m for Madrid and Barça since the start of the season.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since raised £476.4m, earning them third and fifth place among football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
Leading the list is Manchester United.
Leading the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not just about glory; it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of which are Spanish) that have participated in the event since its inception in the 1992 / 1993 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is ranked third in Europe, which has made the most money from its participation, and is the only club apart from AC Milan to have won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champions, who last won the European Cup in 1992, finished fifth.
The list is topped by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also made the most money from their participation in last season's Champions League.
Even though they lost to Barça.
Spain, on the other hand, are only third among countries that have been able to make money from the Champions League, despite having more titles than anyone else (five, as opposed to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).

This apparent contradiction can be explained by the complicated funding procedure used by UEFA.
The organisation, which is chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenue from the Champions League to be £1.090m this financial year.
Of this money, UEFA earmarks 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million by their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team); the clubs that reached the last eight will each receive three million; the four that reached the quarter-finals will receive 3.3 million.
The final four get $4 million each.
The winner earns $9 million, as opposed to the runner-up, who gets $5.2 million.
So a football club gets at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, meanwhile, earned £2.5million for winning the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million have been earmarked.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second place, 20% of the third place finishers and 10% of the fourth place finishers.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday leaked details of the offer to buy shares in order to acquire a ceiling of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) because of the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa is offering 1.5025 euros per share, which will be paid for ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jeréz-based group gives shareholders 15 days to declare their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV confirmed that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the authority.
If completed, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
Attempting to stay on the sidelines of potential bids and the legal wrangling of his ex-managers, the Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
It is a decision that will make her the first woman to hold a senior position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which reports directly to the Chairman of the Group.
This is far from free of controversy, as the company is embroiled in a legal battle over the suspected diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies belonging to the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
Regarding the Salazar loan, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public tender for Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October last.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this call for tenders after it had been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the laws in force and that the content of the explanatory supplement submitted, following the amendments of 2 December last, can therefore be considered "sufficient."
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn represents 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been permanently invested, which cannot be transferred in any way until the completion of the call for tenders, the price of which has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New vehicle inspection programmes
In these days of severe weather and accidents, it is not only the car workshops that deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to repairers, where an expert assesses the damage caused and the cost of repairs.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The manual calculation of repair costs ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
This is why almost 100% of surveyors use this type of system.
The service and application providers for accident assessment and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers for subsequent processing and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are based on its products.
The other two companies competing in the market for evaluation and report preparation tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex sales manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are involved, each of whom provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years there have been more versions, variants and motors on the market than in the whole of the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, companies start to work.
It is an arduous task, because each of the thousands and thousands of vehicle parts has to be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image is created of each model, on which different parts of the vehicle can be "clicked."
If it is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the process proceeds swiftly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, for example, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the number of vehicles on the roads, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight distributed centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for documentation and database production, each of which specialises in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus to offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this service in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard accident assessment solution for surveyors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for according to the intended use, i.e. for each expert opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who use it rarely, no more than ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that makes thousands of appraisals negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, a vehicle and the equipment with which it came off the assembly line can be fully identified by the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with car windows, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for specialist dealers, which can be used to provide services for vehicles declared to have total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or obtaining information on variations by make and model.
It can be used, for example, to examine how many models of a particular car brand have had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them have been involved in a serious accident over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for appraisers and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for appraisals is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 appraisers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has grown at an annual rate of 20% over the last three years and in 2008 their turnover amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, with the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and today its shares trade at $2.4 billion.
They have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and are part of the benchmark Standard & Poor's index.
Auction of crashed cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This appraisal and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, garages, scrapyards and car dealers, who need to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 appraisers.
Every day, 3,000 advertisements are managed and 100 new advertisements are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been cancelled may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be re-registered even if they have been registered after difficult administrative procedures.
Quotation of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives an estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, preparation and cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database comprises 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a diagram of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of working hours, surcharges or discounts, and then he can print the estimate and pass it on to his client.
However, AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audatex is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, as it allows, for example, to select a door and then completely flip the picture to look at the inside.
