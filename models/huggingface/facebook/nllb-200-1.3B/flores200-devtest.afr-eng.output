To date, there is one test vaccine that reduces deaths from Ebola, but to date no drugs have shown clear suitability for treating an existing infection.
One antibody, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies have shown it to have less than desired benefits in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists use it as a baseline and compare three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by a step forward with meaningful change in our organization, rather than the withdrawal of certificates.

Not only does it confirm that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut brown above with a pale or cartoid-colored underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, also called the rhachis, but they do have other features of feathers - scissors and bearded side branches - the researchers concluded that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or repulsion. The researchers suggest that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers and not a chicken's fangs.
The researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers and not chicken donuts.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius constellation.
The effect the team sought would be caused by tidal forces between the Milky Way's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a type of radiant corona, and is made up of very small particles.

Their thermal behavior is not as moderate as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with these deep holes in the ground, says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astro-geology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a box, and then put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law has codified these procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot papers have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were there at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added except those counted and by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process.

Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
As a result, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be affected because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish legal systems work differently and courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists cross a dangerous line when they publish photos and other material of suspects.
The Crown Office, which has overall control of prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until charges were filed.
The document, according to the informant, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a sustained military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence only for five years.
Field guards closely monitored shooters in the supplemental pest control trial, as the trial was monitored and efficacy evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provincial Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some due since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheat have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not-serious".
The ministry's office responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly a pity".
The quake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (9:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been reported dead.
Six hostages, including kidnapped and elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to do research on preterm births in his spare time.
Her research showed that if hormones are administered, this will speed up the fetal lung development of the baby.
Xinhua reports that on Wednesday, the state investigation team recovered two black box flight recorders.
People wrestlers also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first Queen of the Extremes. My first manager Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was just as strange as I was... maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place.
Out of the 1,400 previous voters in the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, their desire for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the poll's extreme, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist, had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He could not use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware or software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water supply to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth was formed, since comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year, signing a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as political gossip and folly.
People are speculating that he will make an attempt in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of liters of fuel annually and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controller to pin down the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transportation is available, and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and stop-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of loss of transportation increased the possibility of the game being forced to be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science mentioned the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the species adapted in just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes, and it can also be rolled into small moulds.
It can be drawn out in a thin thread, which can be twisted or braided, beaten out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and pasted onto other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in the pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Wrap the two dry powders together and then dip them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Dara had a flush toilet in almost every home, and it was attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a mixed society.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as herds.
Lion troops consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in action, and are also very lethal to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full roar of a lion but more like a phrase of screeching words.
Small game cats like to eat small animals. They will catch apes, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that hunt the game cat are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that oselotes follow animals (prey) and find them by smell. They sniff the ground to find out where the animals have been.
They are very good at seeing in the dark with night vision, and they also move unseen.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is removed from the main population from which they originate (such as when they migrate across a mountain range or a river, or when they migrate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than their previous needs to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, still requiring the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and make our clothes. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the predator at the top of the food chain of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw has more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We do not know for sure, but he could have had a sharp tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, molasses and he could have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not have been able to resist it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts involving wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of porcupine known as a hazelnut.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from the Americas, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner room that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not that important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters overlooking the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
IF YOU have seen the film National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parking document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for tampering.
So, it is possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but still the south was not free.
It was controlled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of allying with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces liberated the south of France and turned to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who work together and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture that relies on the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a sustained cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures frequently disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, having no national executive or court, they relied on the state authorities, who often refused to cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
Nor did it have any authority to cross state tax laws and tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before their changes could be made and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in International Games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an archipelago because of the cluster of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors passed by to take the island's name as Ilha Formose, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base southwest of Taiwan, and a transformation in native grain production practices by hiring Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Policy, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates motion while maintaining some order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put under the spotlight.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith has united European states despite differences in language and culture.
Its all-pervading power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary find is there specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of riots, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been proven effective; it has cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade has broken generally accepted international laws through several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large areas of the ocean, which would pose danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
During these periods there was fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to one monarch.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to pass.
Dieselfe applies to the army, as the army ranges are now based on caliber, rather than on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has long survived, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests atop one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knew it existed.
Nothing but the clear, beautiful air above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the death of Pharaoh.
The Giza Plato, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upper-arch mark looks like a V and the lower-arch mark looks like a square or a square without its lower side.
Up means you must start at the point and press the bow, and down means you must start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bowed chord usually creates a softer sound, while a down-bowed chord is stronger and more self-contained.
Feel free to enter your own notes, but remember that the printed line marks are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a mob of marketwomen.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris while surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the demonstration waved the head of a royal who had been killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to settle a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds have been driven by the Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological necessity in the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic accompanied by scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most breakdowns of technological definitions share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces effects on society that are indigenous, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a countrywide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture that were connected to that environment arose, and these things, in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices whose value was higher than that offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Because of the slow communication channels, styles in the west may fall behind by 25 to 30 per year.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest developments of the time was the Crusades, when people began to use knots to tie clothes.
Livestock farming is farming done to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, multicultural organic system that preserves seeds native to the ecosystem combined with alternate farming or other relatively easy techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characteristic because of the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, including fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adverse circumstances, or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults as the children grew up.
Some wild children have been hooked by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is due to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some remained on their own in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a wild child displays behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the particular caretaker animal, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, ladderwork goes one step further.
Steering is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are starting a new learning method, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Steers can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of a steer but so is the little slider man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Steps are in the software and are intended to question, speed up, and explain procedures to students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing, and nurturing, but that is the reality.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Nursing care was supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they had been taken earlier.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and rewards approach.
For example, learning and socializing are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites, they identified their "personal engagement" and "continuing relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is reported that one can add up when a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microexpressions.
In his document, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The process of mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants available.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: suppressed growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources to access would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our progeny solved their own protein problem in a way similar to the way some chimpanzees on the savanna today do.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back to sleep for a short time afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to put it down.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces one to get up so that you can urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates with the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force that is present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, led by the USSR and the USA, with the end of the war and clashes of system, process and culture leading to the countries falling out.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies were present enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real terms, by proxy troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
How, though, did these plans become obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII, in which the Americans tried to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might well have been able to conquer Britain as it could conquer the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and were looked after by goat herders who were multiples of children or teenagers, similar to the more ubiquitous shepherds. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
Wasps were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wasp tracks were mostly made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses they pulled to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than it would have taken to do so on the almost rougher roads of the day.
Threshold beams were fitted fairly early to hold the tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more finishing of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and the first pure iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal specialties are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to some extent.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but anyway, if we're not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and we need to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have grown because of overpopulation and mankind's excessive lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printer's office of John Dunlap.
By night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap swords are known as the oldest copies of the document in existence.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or home of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to set up an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by a scientific method. This method actually accompanies most scientific research.
Although not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, are recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will sustain a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external guidance.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that either labeled the DNA in the beak with radioactive phosphorus or the beak's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells that are affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the goal of enjoying the environment, including plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studies of ecosystem information.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn about orangutan trees and take pictures of them.
Every morning people leave the small villages in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplaces are in the area from which they have just moved.
In this dynamic commuter vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science points out that this massive carbon economy has affected the stable conditions of the biosphere that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges crumbling.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport intruders just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers act within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of driveway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back on the body.
This gives them a wider variety of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the conch and the dayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the solar system moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, for the earth does not feel as if it were moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
Ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language of many who work in states where Latin is regularly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had a theory that they could change into new forms that we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in that dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil's status and use have declined as newer writing methods have been adopted.
People now text on account screens, and don't need to get close to a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new passes.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, and splitting a nucleus releases that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/ or desires that become internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that makes them do certain good or not do it.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start mentoring their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is to remain "one of the men" (or "girls").
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she needs to change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a break between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet against different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organization, creativity and wisdom can come through.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome the hurdle can lead to a new innovation process to serve the needs of the customer.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006), described the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, so it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, tears, and tumors affect behavior and, in some cases, alter some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the brain structures and processes as never before.
These provide us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although it has a strong connotation with science fiction, Al is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and queries as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, civil engineering, and the military, and has also been built into various home computer and video game software applications.
Outings are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a good way to reflect on an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web portal about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online and serve as a sticker book.
Webinars can also help improve students' writing ability. While students regularly begin their webinars experience with sloppy language and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web columnist begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to become more proficient about the world around them.) The need to nurture the interest of the crowd inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as develop their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, and it contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka and surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as being more Canadian than it is to outsiders.
Large areas farther north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a strong hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it is one that doesn't look expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be chased, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you turn men away, and do not be afraid to stand up for your rights (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shops to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina it is easy to find places that offer traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cooking pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of excesses, but that's also for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the town's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing state of fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the jumping-off point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma.The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although it has a reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the dangers of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab flair than that of an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card which gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a dazzling column graph accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best scenes of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront across the river.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km (50 mi) into the interior of Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just halofite marshes - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/ marshes.
Sundarbani has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going in an eastern direction, depart between 06:30 and 07:30 to Jakar/Bumthang.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and robust.
Shared rental cars are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paru (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long and have two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational according to schedule in September of 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group to inhabit the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as The Great Province of the Indies, was born as a result of the skirmishes of Spanish conquerors with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polovelds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and contests can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley across the FIC West store.
British pounds will be widely accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also regularly accepted.
In the remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currencies will be accepted; ask the owners in advance to determine what the accepted payment method would be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and so is the other way around.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures barely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the nature is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they appear, buffalo, buffalo, American buffalo, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year thousands of visitors are injured because they did not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval stand in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British warship was sunk, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the death of the Tupua chieftain Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches across two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
North Coast beaches (in the North Harbour district) are facing the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most have shelters provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylaan beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops along the edge of the beach.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better shipped.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is an outlier. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is equivalent to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many tours are undertaken to the reefs throughout the year, and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
Yet, take advice from authorities, obey all notices, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booked in advance, the travelers have peace of mind that they will have somewhere to relax when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels even though you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/ from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the discussions for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the largest number of attendees decide to camp on the grounds, and most view it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you're going to have to get in early to get a campground close to the music.
Remember that while music on the main stages may come to an end, there may be sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the North Baltic region in winter, make sure of the location of the hut, as it makes a great deal of noise for those most affected to pass through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in town. Ride passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the money spent by guests.
To stick to their premise and to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment.
However, drunkenness affects your judgment, and all good gamblers recognize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subfreezing temperatures.
Friction on icy and snow-covered roads is very low, and you cannot drive as if you were on a bare tarmac.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-borne snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari popularly refers to overland travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially in savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and camel horses, tend to get too close to carts, and standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, leopards, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a forest walk, walking safari, or walking) consists of a walk of several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until June 2020 for when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000 with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000 and up.
Many hotels have a sewing chair and ironing board available to borrow, even if there is none in the room.
If a hair dryer is not available or you do not like wearing knitted socks, you may want to try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans violently, do not usually qualify as pests.
Free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods, exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it frequently goes into deserted inland terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your distance: steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp curves prevail.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40mph (56-64 km/ h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the cell phone service here is better than many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples baked into pies throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer months.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often well paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich doughs, try what is called the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is common in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of local dishes from across the nation.
However, when used with further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from central and eastern parts of mainland Java.
Javanese food now freely available throughout the archipelago is characterized by simple flavored dishes, the prominent flavoring for Javanese food are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Beams are for supporting the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse loses its rider and its foot gets stuck in the reins, it can be dragged along if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear ice boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some halls, especially English halls, have safety bars that allow a stallion's belt to fall off the hall if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
Mountain ruins include breathtaking views of peaks, and climbers from around the world are constantly seeking new routes through the endless walls of rock.
Down-hill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skis or snowboards tied to one's feet on snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski boamers" who plan entire vacations to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings dating as far back as 5,000 B.C. depict skiers!
downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski tours: This activity may also be called indoor skiing, ski tour or ski hike.
It is related to, but does not include, alpine ski tours or mountain climbing, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will cover somewhat greater distances than by walking  but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without  a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean having to go through multiple visa applications and passport control points.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
By having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for each of the Schengen member states separately, and you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of whether manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Craftsmanship is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for others with many other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi are involved in large-scale reindeer farming but have survived from fishing, hunting, or similar activities, using the reindeer mostly as a draught animal.
Today, many Sámi work in modern trades, and tourism is a major source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.

Strong winds, hail, heavy rain, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spills, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include heavy snow brought by strong winds, heavy snowfall, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for a hostile environment course will most likely yield the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment operations overseas should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The eagerness of governments to issue passports where the gender is not indicated (X) or documents that are updated to match a prestigious name and gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to comply with these documents is just as volatile.
Searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive after the September 11, 2001 era.
Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reef currents are the return of the flow of waves breaking off the shore, usually at a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is more concentrated at a few deeper parts, and a rapid upflow to deeper water may be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when one tries to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move to a place where you will not be trapped again, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, and perhaps wait for rescue.
Recurrent shock arrives earlier than culture shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adjusted easily to the new culture find it difficult to adjust again to their native culture.
When you return from abroad, you have already adjusted to the new culture and lost some of your customs from your home culture.
When you first went overseas, people were surely patient and quick, knowing that travelers in a new land would have to adjust.
Patience and understanding should not be expected to be too much for travelers returning home.
The pyramidal sound and light display is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and traders. The story of the sound and the lights is like a storybook.

The mountains of the Peninsula merge here into the plateau, and then come out again from the 360km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4,892 m (14,890 ft).
In remote areas, without cell phone reception, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not a general replacement for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.

Finland is a good boat destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the island group and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any hunting, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boat rides are a national time-drive in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is consistent with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in Holland the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises usually include extended holiday stays.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while returning and sleeping on the ship in the evening.
If you land and use your onboard excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some pleasure boat trips brochures have included Berlin, Germany in their price list. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the tour.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience before.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears or dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how something about an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help to overcome fears based on the unknown or not being in control.
Frequently, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or replacement parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies had their own aircraft on some routes, but for the other routes and smaller firms the problem was a problem.
If they ship these goods by air, the unloading and handling of some routes can take days.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it as checked baggage.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet  get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal fare for the economy and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting to a destination quickly and comfortably, and their bill is accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any other UN member state.
Economic links were reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political talks.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by scratching marks or graffiti into the structures.

During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries offer garb to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Within the same guidelines, men are expected to wear pants that cover their knees.
It can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed by every user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing the skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, similar to the same zones in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any other available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
