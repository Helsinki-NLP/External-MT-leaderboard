Two influential women share their secrets of success
What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
New York real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran was able to turn a $1000 loan into a $5 billion real estate company before applying her expertise on the big screen by joining the investor panel of ABC's reality series Shark Tank.
Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female boxer in the world, winning four times as an undefeated champion, before adding the roles of host, author and speaker to her resume.
Despite their unique career skills (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women to help a promising industry talk to entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-flying goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and found that 80 percent of them feel that society has set them stereotypical roles and expectations.
As a result, they came up with The Maxx You Project to help women break down these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know so much about this, and they may be at the top of their field by now, but the journey there hasn't been smooth for either of them.
Corcoran got mostly D's in high school and college and had worked 20 jobs by the time he was 23.
Ali entered one of the most male-centric realms and, furthermore, he was tempted to try to step out of the shadow of his father, who was an icon of the universe.
These two, in a nutshell, are packed with difficulty-built knowledge.
So we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, success, and trusting our gut feelings in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
LAila Ali: I am inspired by my personal goals every day.
I've gotten into the habit of writing down things I want to accomplish.
And I'm going to look at that list.
I feel responsible.
Of course, my kids inspire me.
My ambitions are what inspire me.
I want to be a winner in everything I do in life.
I know that achieving my goals requires hard work, but I'm willing to do it.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Laila, the key to my confidence is preparing too much, but I'm not going to take my inspiration away from that.
In fact, I'm inspired by a real curiosity.
What happens if I do this?
What's left if I don't?
That curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning, because I can't wait to see what the day brings.
If some days I don't feel that way, I just pretend to feel that way.
Then I'll just keep believing in my own shame and get inspired again.
Tell me about some obstacles in your career that have made you better in the long run.
Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing for me was when my best business partner left me and married my secretary.
I quit the business a year later, but that year of my life - being the fifth wheel - was terrible because I didn't have the confidence to leave.
I felt humiliated, I felt no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest thing to believe is in those moments when you're being attacked.
Getting your own footing and starting your business again - this time without a partner - was a very difficult year.
Laila Ali: I would say that the hardest time of my career was when I was a boxer, I was at the peak of my career, and I decided to file for divorce.
I didn't just divorce my husband, but I also divorced that manager and the man who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could do without him.
So I started worrying about my career future, and I had to find time to step back and say to myself, "You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all that experience in the boxing ring.
You can do it without a doubt".
So I re-formed my new team and I continued my career.
Actually, it just took a good mood, because everything else was getting a boost from there.
I did what I had to do, I had to face my fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and manager and move on with my career, and everything was cool.
When did you feel that you had really succeeded?
Laila Ali: I felt like I had made it when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, be unbeaten.
I was able to achieve that goal, and I won the title of champion not once, but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment I felt that I had succeeded was in my 11th year of service.
I was finally profitable.
I had made a profit of about $42,000, which I could not have expected.
I went out and bought my mom and dad a new car, they never had a new car, and I had the cars shipped to Florida, where they spent their retirement years.
I felt like the queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I made a lot more of it in the years that followed, but nothing has been able to offer the same feeling as the opportunity to give something back to your parents and surprise them.
How did you manage to keep yourself motivated to keep working during this 11-year period?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit because that wasn't my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could go.
I had a dream from day one of becoming the real estate queen of New York.
And I saw myself in the eyes of the spirit as a pope, all kissing my ring and adoring me.
I had this little idea in my head.
So, if I was always trying every day, every hour, I wasn't really thinking about making money.
I ended up making money by accident.
But all the money that came in, I put it back into the business.
I don't even think I've ever had a day that was so depressing that I thought, oh, my God, we're not making any money.
I was just convinced that something was gonna work.
The worst thing that could have happened was losing the company and becoming a reporter again.
I made good drinks and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
So I don't think that the greatest pursuit of many successful people is money.
They have other motives that encourage them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for anyone who has such big dreams but is held back by a financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have time.
I started a business.
And so I found myself five different partners who weren't even real estate professionals, but in different neighborhoods all over the city who knew their streets through and through.
I went up to them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money and you'll be my partner".
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have a gift, you can sell it to someone who has money, and then make money off it.
There are two ways: gift and money.
But without both, nothing big happens.
In the end, I have - and my partners have - done very well over the years with these great investors that I would never have had if I hadn't had the courage to find some fighting people who like to step up.
It's always possible to make money if you believe you have a gift and you know your part of the world better than anyone else.
So, what are the two or three things you do every morning that help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but there are many times in my life that I feel overwhelmed being a mother, a businesswoman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I reached a point in my life where I really had to put my morning routine back together.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Gratitude for the resurrection, for your health, for your children, for your family.
I write down my goals for the next day often, and when I wake up, I look at that list again.
I'm meditating.
Sometimes I write in the diary.
I always have a cup of coffee.
And I always do exercise first thing in the morning, because if I don't, I'm not gonna do it.
For me, it's ultimately about priorities.
These are the things that matter to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then my training, and my health.
It makes everything else seem easy.
I feel like I can take on any challenge I face in the course of a day.
I'm just going to sort things out in order of importance.
I'm working through a list of tasks that are endless and ridiculous.
And I'll put in the most important place.
What are real priorities?
I'm trying to make peace with the most important things.
What do you do to get yourself in the right mood for a great meeting?
I imagine myself falling through.
Strange as it is.
I think, my God, I'm failing.
I'm scared of myself, and it makes me try harder.
I imagine anyone who competes with me -- I'm naturally very combative, because I'm one of ten children and we never got enough of our parents' attention.
I can be very competitive.
And I always come in too thoroughly prepared.
Overpreparation makes me more confident.
LA: It's amazing how opposed we are to this.
We're two successful people, and it shows how different things work for different people.
I like to imagine that I'm successful.
I like to think about what success is for.
I can imagine it in my mind, I can see it actually happening.
I see myself in the ring, fighting, wearing a belt and getting back in the dressing room celebrating victory with a piece of cake, like I always have.
The same goes for meetings.
I always prepare myself thoroughly, and that confidence comes from being prepared because I'm afraid that I'm not doing well or that I'm not saying the right things or that I don't have the information I need.
This is where I get the game.
But I always enter by visualizing the end result.
You've both been very successful in your careers.
How do you pass it on?
LA: I'm really excited to be part of T.J. Maxx's Maxx You Project, because I feel like this is an opportunity to do good.
A lot of women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
We all have a champion.
It's really about having the mood and having the tools you need, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have been able to achieve the things you're trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One of the things I think I do very well is inspire people.
So I was very excited when I was asked to work with Maxx You Project.
I try to ignite the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see in the faces of all these people here, and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people start out pursuing their dreams, but they tend to go wrong at some point.
So we're trying to help them focus on the goal.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even a simple thing like an elevator pitch, everything you need to start a business.
What advice would you give women who want to succeed in male-centric fields?
Laila Ali: I work in one of the most male-centric fields, which is boxing.
Following in the footsteps of my father, who was a global icon and the greatest of all time, was quite daunting.
For me, the essence of the thing was actually finding that talent, that courage, that strength in itself.
First thing I had to do was believe in myself that I could get into boxing and be successful.
At that time, no one else was involved except me, and there were no restrictions imposed on my path except those I had set myself in my head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having my own attitude -- the "Queen of Real Estate in New York City" -- and crossing the finish line is a long one.
And at this intermediate stage, which is every day of your career, you need a lot of talent.
You don't have to deal with real estate to get those gifts.
I'm sure that in Laila's field, too, you had to decide which people were right, which managers were right, when to start, when to finish, how much money you had, what you could put in, what you couldn't, how hard you were willing to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little more supportive so that these women really feel, "Okay, I get it.
Let me try it.
Here are my three priorities".
When they leave with three top priorities to make things really happen, I go home smiling in bed at night.
What's going on in your nightclub right now?
Too much coke.
Newspapers, books, little prayer angel, my diary.
Probably a water bottle.
Barbara Corcoran: I have a little green alarm clock in my bedroom because I tried to break the habit of looking at my phone every morning as the first thing.
That's why I bought it.
That was sweet.
But it never worked.
And it's still standing there.
And my phone's still in my bedroom.
What book are you reading?
Barbara Corcoran: Eighth or ninth time  "How to win friends and influence people".
It keeps me on track.
I think it's still the best book ever written in this field, no matter what your dreams are.
And it is possible to relate to it today in exactly the same way as in the past.
I like to read it over from time to time.
It'll help me get back on track.
Laila Ali: I'm in nutrition school, so I read the book "Nisu Free Diet".
It's about eating grains and how they affect our bodies.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice for dealing with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the pessimists.
You're going to meet them in all sorts of different ways.
You need to remove them from your brain vocabulary.
Stay away from the buggers.
They're gonna suck you up.
I treat the thugs like thieves.
They come in at night, they grab your purse and they leave.
Pessimists destroy a team in any environment faster than you can blink, because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad too.
They're pulling good people into the hole.
I can perfectly avoid all negative people within 50 kilometers of me because my goal is to be positive and take everything from life that gives and give away everything that I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend a minute or so on people like that?
We have to be consistent.
We've started many times convinced that we're going to take this course.
We'll do this, this, and this.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up right before they reach the last threshold.
So I think we need to stay on course.
If you have a passion for something, you believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: It takes a lot of hard work to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes?
Finishing things.
If you start something, you end it.
Many are good beginners, but not very good graduates.
Latvia has the largest number of non-citizens in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
There are 125 344 stateless people living in Riga, 14 266 in Daugavpils and 11 909 in Liepājas.
Outside the big cities, the largest number of stateless people in Latvia live in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmieras (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, there were 242 560 people living in Latvia who did not have Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, there were 392,816 stateless people living in Latvia.
Jürgen Lig recently commented on Facebook: "The quote is a bad reason".
So I'm not going to look back and try not to remember what has been done in history to re-create humanity and what results have been achieved.
I do not give an estimate of whether these tests can be considered successful or unsuccessful.
I also avoid excessive citations, although I lean on the thought of my most important teacher, Thomas Paul: All my thoughts are borrowed from somewhere, if only I could remember where exactly.
The most visible work of Estonia today is to transform the citizen of the Republic of Estonia into a perfect person.
We don't raise him like we raise a child - in the good faith that he will become a human being.
We raise him as the ruling class imagines - what a person must be to live and speak in public in Estonia.
The censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class changed in part a year ago, some of the methods of education are as frightening as those of the previous ruling class, now the poorest of the nobles - their cruelty is not at all inferior to the former.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is a marmalade of the new age of fine sound.
0,5 per milliliters for public officials
The ruling class includes not only politicians who are paid by the state for their work, but also those self-aware people who do politics voluntarily (read: deliberately): they write opinion pieces using the image of Mihkel Mut, they scramble on Facebook, as the fearful people around them live in this crowded Estonia, they picket, boycott, juggle, sabotage.
They agree to stay only in the echo chamber (the English term for people living in a room where only their opinions are appropriate, such as their own Facebook friends, etc.), but this is not possible in conflict in Estonia.
There are still some of my fellow citizens who think or do something that is intolerable to the cajano.
And there's a war of words and the scum of business is ringing.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how much people can drink, who to sleep with, how many children to put on, how to work, how much to pay, when to rest, what to think about, what to eat, how to divorce, when to be sick, how to die.
Very important places.
If their public speeches are contradicted by anything other than what they said, they're angry, offended, hysterical.
The fact that people in many European countries drive a "full headed" car, and that is permitted by law, does not change their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance in every area, but behind zero tolerance is not care, but a dirtbag.
Class hatred and racism, only people like me are good.
Holy politicians can only open their mouths, but never their hearts.
They believe that any "measure" they use to improve society works and is worth a try.
Fortunately for them, we have enough large card forces of brightly-attended, mind-bending, cascade-like animals that jump through every window without feeling pain.
So it seems reasonable to us that a wise farmer should open his mouth and be emotionally beaten up in the mansion for it.
Some of the words that will definitely get us into the castle are gay, refugee, woman, violence, hard work, etc.
If you believe everything that selfish officials, activists, and politicians (a small fraction of all such groups, but they can rob society of everything) say and write, you are not only ugly, lazy, and unpleasant, but also brain-free, without a clue.
But let's not believe, let's not tolerate coercion, let's not forbid drinking.
The Estonian person drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the state allows.
The Estonian person will tolerate more than he is forced to tolerate.
The Estonian person does not change his behavior two months before the election, so that after achieving the goal, he can turn his back on his popularity diet and again not only in, but also out, what unpleasant brain damage quickly recovers.
Whoever does otherwise is not the right Estonian.
I don't think any human being can be re-educated.
I believe that a person can be taught.
Drinking rationally, loving your family, being a hardworking, polite, attractive companion not only to friends but to society as a whole.
Teaching doesn't always have to be about fining, restricting, banning, forcing, calling a riot, cornering, throwing rotting eggs in the media.
The teacher must be an example.
A smoking politician talking about the harmfulness of tobacco?
A cop who speeds up in his spare time is fining me for speeding?
And then you're stuck in the middle of a colleague's head...
I have such a vague idea that maybe we should try to re-educate the ruling class.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
When you drink, drink in public, in a raisin' place, in front of the whole crowd.
Forcing speeds only in public - governors' cars, even private cars, all red.
If you rule, rule as if you rule yourself.
Maybe shame is enough when words and deeds don't go together.
Or we'll find out we want to be ruled by the most vulnerable.
Because all of us, Estonians, are what we don't want to be right now.
Where to run from yourself?
Leaking Trump's transcripts is a federal crime, according to former prosecutors.
The person who leaked the transcripts of phone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press was likely to have committed a crime, former prosecutors alleged Thursday when lawmakers called for a guilty verdict.
"It is a crime to publish these documents to the press without authorization", former District Attorney Joe diGenova told Fox News.
These various acts, which include the disclosure of the notes and transcripts of the conversations between the President and the foreign heads of state, pose a serious threat to national security.
The Washington Post reported on Thursday, based on leaked documents, new details about Trump's tense talks with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in late January.
In the first, Trump ordered the head of state of Mexico to allegedly stop publicly declaring that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the paper, the transcripts contained notes indicating that the Director-General of the National Security Council had concealed them.
The Post said that they had received complete transcripts "compiled by White House staff" based on letters from White House note-takers.
"There is a federal statute that makes it a federal crime to leak classified information to an unauthorized person", said former New York State Attorney Doug Burns in a telephone interview.
While some of these speeches were made public as early as February, the release of the transcripts marks a much greater boost for the White House, which is trying to reduce leaks.
The report was published by chance as senior Trump administration figures prepared to go public on Friday to demonstrate their commitment to unraveling the leakers of classified information.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Deputy Attorney General General Rod Rosenstein and Director of the National Intelligence and Security Center William Evaninat are expected to take the public to the Department of Justice headquarters to learn about the situation.
It's not clear if the Justice Department is investigating the Post leak.
To hold someone responsible, Burns says, "certain elements must be clearly proven".
He said "this could lead to confusion", referring to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation into the emails and decision not to press charges.
These considerations shall include the labelling and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the event of classification, prosecutors will investigate whether the document was leaked to an unauthorized person in a manner that adversely affects the interests of the United States.
"If all this can be proven, people can undoubtedly be in a criminal defense situation", Burns said.
"No doubt about it.
Speaking of Trump's phone transcripts, diGenova, who was the prosecutor for espionage, said that such documents are "usually classified as classified and highly classified".
Claiming that these leaks threaten the ability of the United States government to influence foreign policy, diGenova appealed to the Attorney General to convene a federal criminal jury to find the leakers.
He also said that a court order should be made to receive the phone messages of reporters and editors of The Washington Post - something that reporters would undoubtedly protest.
Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a Republican, told Capitol Hill Thursday that leaking classified information should be prosecuted.
"The person who leaked them must be found - they must be punished and they must be fired", Lee told America's News HQ on Fox News.
"It's unacceptable and this should never happen".
Lee, who practiced law before being elected to the Senate in 2010, called such a move "a crime, a very serious federal crime".
"This should not and should not involve dismissal alone, but also criminal proceedings, given that classified information is involved", he said.
Fox News was told that at this stage, the Justice Department's Friday announcement may provide more insight into what the Justice Department hopes to achieve than clarify the definitive procedures.
Last week, President Sessions criticized him and publicly poured out his anger on the Attorney General, claiming that the latter had not done enough to find the leakers.
"I want the attorney general to be much harsher on the leaks coming from the security agencies", Trump said on July 25 in Russia.
Sessions himself confessed to Tucker Carlson of Fox News last week that he was unhappy with the efforts made to investigate the leaks that have repeatedly put obstacles in the way of the president since his inauguration.
"I have not been satisfied with the previous criminal prosecutions and investigations into the leaks", Sessions said.
Even some who criticize the president have spoken out against the leaks, saying that such conduct is detrimental to foreign policy efforts.
"The leak of a transcript of a speech between the president and the head of state is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous", David Frum wrote in the Atlantic on Thursday.
"It is extremely important that the president can communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly, that foreign leaders understand that they can respond confidentially".
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the Democratic chairman of the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak was "absolutely" concerning and that Congress should investigate it.
10 continuous promotional items to make food appealing
Since many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses other ingredients that deceive people - like glue instead of milk or potato chips instead of ice cream.
YouTube channel Top Trending reviews the tricks that have become quite common in the advertising world.
When someone opens a popcorn box for advertising or takes a burger out of a box, a lot of nice steam blows out.
In fact, the time is longer and during this time hot food does not evaporate because the steam comes from a high water content that is not available in, for example, dairy products.
Therefore, when placed in a pack or food, they are water-soaked fruit bats that have the ability to absorb and retain water.
When the heat is exchanged, they will boil much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product will look freshly prepared.
Potato powder is a great help to photographers because it does not melt under light or heat and does not significantly alter the consistency of many other foods.
For example, a cake may be filled with cream or ice cream instead of potato powder.
The odd color and decorative elements and the consumer have been tricked again.
Glue replaces milk.
It's not easy to photograph milk either, because in a photo, it may not look so white at all.
Also, foods served with milk quickly become fermented in it.
Since, for example, morning sickles or mules must look crisp and tasty inside milk, glue is used instead of milk, which is not passed through any of the milk.
If restaurants can make a lot of effort to make meat to be tasty and ripe, they don't do that in advertising.
Yet, the meat advertised looks particularly attractive, as if it came straight from the grill.
Often, however, it is cooked in a pan or in an oven and pulled into the meat by a shoe-wash.
It's as difficult to work with a powdered liquid as it is to work with ice cream because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that looks almost identical to a bearded person - a bearded watch.
So it could be advertising on a cake or a berry or inside a milkshake.
Even the surface of fruit sold in stores can have a thin layer that makes them look more glossy.
But that's not enough for a photo, and instead, a deodorant is sprayed on it to add sparkle to the fruit.
The water is also not very photogenic because over time it becomes more liquid or is separated from it, for example, water.
But here comes the help of wax, whose bright colors and more durable texture make it possible to create an attractive image of the face.
The wax is also likely to have been used in pictures of chocolate melting on a cake or ice cream.
If you notice in the ad a perfectly crispy cookie with a perfect cookie-to-fill ratio, there's probably some extra layer or pieces of paper used.
That's because cutting open a cookie can scatter the filling and ruin the image.
When you put the pieces in the cake after cutting and spray them over with filling, it leaves a much more beautiful impression visually.
The pop and button are also used inside the burger to put all the ingredients in the place they are to keep them in place.
That's why the burger on the table doesn't look like a commercial.
Paper chicken full of chicken.
The ad looks like a grilled, full oven, but it may not even be cooked.
To give the impression of completeness, a piece of paper filled with chicken is dipped, whipped with potato powder, if necessary, and then simply sprayed with brown.
Pancakes are particularly popular in American advertising for the use of watch syrup, which creates a large pancake appeal.
In fact, the cookies quickly suck the syrup into themselves, and the flowing syrup quickly disappears from the photographer's view.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a cleanser for the sofa bed, which helps to prevent rapid absorption.
Often, this also does not help, so instead, the engine oil is used to make the golden brown butter, which is poured on hot pancakes and presented as syrup.
Former soldier sentenced to prison for the murder of a retired pensioner suspected of sexual abuse
A former soldier was sentenced to a minimum of 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of mistreating a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy (70) was convicted in June 2016 by the High Court of Glasgow of the murder of David Farish (75) at his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire, in February 2016.
Lord Summers called the murder "extremely brutal" because the victim's body had 14 stab wounds.
State defense attorney Brian McConnachie said the killing was caused by "temporary insanity", but he described the circumstances as "recurring".
Cassidy heard that Farish had sexually abused a woman for a long time.
His lawyer said that the man went to Farish's house and "became friends" with him in the hope of hearing a confession, not with the intention of killing him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy demonstrated signs of intent on the day of the attack, and pointed to a social work report that revealed that the defendant had undergone military training by special forces on how to infiltrate groups through friendship.
No charges have been filed against Farise.
The court was informed that after the murder, Cassidy himself contacted the police and turned himself in.
McConnachie revealed that most people have a "difficulty understanding" that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense attorney said: "He's never had any problems in his life before this incident.
He lived a full life until this madness in February 2016".
Cassidy's health is reportedly poor and he's been under surveillance for a heart attack and stroke.
According to Lord Summers, when he was sentenced to a minimum of 17 years to life, he took into account the fact that Cassidy had no prior convictions and what he was allegedly told about Farish.
Scottish police described the incident as "a particularly shocking murder of a man in his own home".
Investigator David Pinkney said: "While this punishment does not overturn his atrocity, I hope it does provide some sort of solution for David's family".
Monday was the last chance to come up with a nice name for a nose-nosed frog born in early June.
Now, zoologists have a large catalogue of names to search for the right one to announce on the zoo's birthday, August 25.
But the Naara's children can be named until the day of their resurrection.
Since the beginning of August, he has seen a whole bunch of rhinoceroses walk alongside him in the garden.
And although Father Kigoma runs around occasionally in a major cleansing and shakes the horn at the garden post, Mother Kibibi does not allow herself to be disturbed, the rhinoceros learns a valuable lesson.
Although the height of the birth has passed, on August 1, you saw the light of the air on a jacket and two home guards for him.
Goldfish can catch flying eagles on a hot summer day.
The takini, the narrow-looking ones, started running.
Thursday was another Vivacolor color day at the zoo.
A large number of good assistants painted the new camel house, the large garden posts of the mother elephant and the viewing terrace of the father elephant.
To avoid confusion with the painters, the mother-elephants Fien and Draay spent time with the father-elephant Carl again.
On August 9, the second classic day of the zoo, the Avo Otsa trumpet ensemble will be held.
The zoo can be used as a memorial for a crown with a nose and a female crown and other beautiful designs.
The proceeds from the sale of the charity will go to support the relevant conservation project.
The charity sales of over €1,000 were raised on the last week's Tiger Day.
It is worth knowing: how do you calculate the amount of sugar in dairy products?
'According to EU food labelling standards, a packaging can contain a quantity of carbohydrates and a quantity of sugars that is not at all comparable to the quantity of white so-called table sugar,' confirmed Krista Kalbin, Marketing Director at Valio Estonia.
He says that dairy products actually contain three types of sugars: lactose in milk, or natural milk sugar, glucose and fructose in fruits, and added sugar, or sucrose.
However, in the light of a few simple basic facts, Kalbin said that calculating the amount of added sugars in the product should not create difficulties.
First, it is necessary to determine whether the milk is milk or an oxygenated milk product.
Conventional milk and milk drinks contain about 5 grams of natural milk sugar, or 100 grams of lactose per product.
In the case of dairy products that have been oxidized, the yogurt or yeast bacteria have consumed some lactose during the oxidation process, so that the dairy products have been oxidized on average by 3,5 g/100 g of lactose per product.
"The first thing to do is to calculate the added sugar by subtracting the amount of sugar from the lactose", Kalbin said.
Now the sugar content of berries and fruit must be calculated by fructose and glucose.
"Generally, fructose and glucose in flavored dairy products is about 0.3 grams for a typical 3-4% fruit content and especially in berries with about 15% fruit content up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams", Kalbin said.
He said that this simple calculation shows that the added sugar content of the fruit juices can be up to twice as low as the sugar content of the packaging.
The situation is slightly different for lactose-free products, as their sugar content depends on the production technology.
Comparison of the most favourable spa packages: from nightclub tickets to sauna towels
The mailman's consumer performance compared the most favourable packages offered by spas to one person for one night on 11-12 August.
'The hotels have different levels and services, so it is very difficult to compare them one by one on the basis of price alone,' said Mario Sau, Sales Manager of OÜ Spa Tours.
Compared to accommodation rates with spa facilities, it turns out that the prices of the most favourable packages vary several times and there are options for both the more demanding client and the more modest holidaymaker.
For example, if a single traveller can spend 51 euros in a single room at the water centre at Värska Spa with a buffet dinner and breakfast and unlimited use of a water park, gym and sauna, a package will cost 287 euros per person when visiting the Pädaste Manor in Muhumaal with a companion.
It includes accommodation in a Double Deluxe room, breakfast at the Alexander Winter Garden and a half-day "Core and Wet" spa package.
When choosing and comparing different packages, it should be borne in mind that a vacation with a friend or companion is the best way to get the best price, since a stay in two rooms is more affordable than a single room.
However, if you wish to rest alone, you will be offered special single rooms and double rooms for an additional fee.
If, in general, an unaccompanied passenger is simply to pay an additional fee of EUR 10 for staying alone in a double room, then a more favourable option can be found in making a compromise.
For example, Fra Mare Thalasso Spas in Haapsalus pays €86 for a single room accommodation, but if desired, a more favourable option is also offered, provided that in the event of a shortage of space, accommodation is provided by informing the customer in advance that someone else is accommodated.
In this case, the price of the package will be EUR 58.
The best deal is to be flexible.
Package prices are dynamic, depending on the day of the week and the order.
'For the most favourable package, prices can range from EUR 112 to EUR 248', explained the sales and marketing manager of V SpaaHotels in Tartu, Triinu Steel, their pricing policy.
He also pointed out that the prices of their hotels vary depending on the fulfilment and added that the customer generally gets the most favourable price by booking directly on their website or by asking for the offer himself.
Since summer is the fastest time for spas, it is worth planning a vacation in advance to avoid a situation where the desired space is sold out.
For example, only suites and the Vihula mansion in the Netherlands have been sold at the Pärnu Hedon Spa and the Strand Spa and the conference hotel selected for the comparison of packages on 11 August.
You do not have to look far to find a relaxing holiday: almost every major Estonian city has one or more spas.
It is also worthwhile to check before buying the package and at the same time not to have a major event nearby, as this will immediately raise the prices of the trucks.
For example, from August 11 to 13, the White House will host events.
At this time, the Haapsalus is full of tourists, the demand for accommodation is very high and we have prices for major events at this time.
"So we don't have any accommodation for sale at a discount or in favourable packages at this time", commented Irene Väli, manager of the Laine spa hotel.
A Chinese company that came to Estonia immediately made a $100 million profit.
The Chinese-owned agricultural retailer Agritera, which started operations only last year, achieved a turnover of almost EUR 100 million.
The profit was almost 2 million euros, writes the Business Day.
The company's financial year report shows that the sales revenue of Agritera OÜ, which engages in the buying and selling of agricultural products, amounted to EUR 100,6 million in 2016.
The profit was EUR 1,91 million.
The company had no business in the previous year.
The company employed an average of 3 people in the soil, with no employees in 2015.
The turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33,6 million, with an average gross salary of EUR 316 per month.
Juri Kolk: Rest all year so you don't need a break
Of course, it was my fault that the vacation was not resting.
I may have been a necessary employee, but I guess I was the only one who felt irreplaceable.
It's my fault that stupid sense of duty has spread in my chest.
The quote at the beginning of this column is a fine one in that it is completely true.
So, the new job I started in March of that year did require some sort of work, but something so much better suited me that I got back to a whole new life in three months, taking a break.
It's summer, it's vacation time.
It's time to give a fresh start, to look at what's happened in life and what direction this whole thing is heading.
"It's Christmas and New Year's Eve for him!" some decent citizen now screams angrily.
Perhaps, but we all know from experience that Christmas is not a time for reflecting on life and setting goals.
Okay, I'm just talking for myself. I can't make any changes at New Year's.
This is a very difficult time for me.
Of course, there is joy and joy in the Christmas season: I love knowing about the triumph of light, I love Christmas presents, and Jesus was also a compassionate, revolutionary man.
Yet, I am often very tired and sometimes stressed during Christmas - already because of the darkness.
Yeah, I do a lot of work in my vacation life, maybe more than I would do in some fucking slaughterhouse, and I've been pretty loud all the time.
Most of the time, I've been running like a squirrel on Christmas Eve... gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little bit more workload...
Considering the constant social pressure to feel unconditional joy and peace in the heart, the difficulties of the Christmas season are evident.
But a desperate, tired person cannot make good decisions, even if they are not improving.
You have to do things like that with a clear head.
A tired person may blow up a void and sound promise that will help him store the foundation for the future as much as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise that is meant to change something should be thought through calmly, it should increase the benefits, it should be a plan.
The plan, unlike a promise, includes a guide to action and will not be broken after a few short strikes.
That's why I say the best time to make promises is now, summer.
You just need to relax and wonder why this fatigue is so great (if it is).
Unless you commit to treating yourself like a calf that got off the table during your vacation, a couple of weeks will be enough to find some hook in your life that's worth twisting and figure out exactly how to do it.
I need to live my life as long as possible so that I don't need a break, so I can take a break on a regular basis, not once a year.
So the holiday is an extra effort, not a survival-enhancing boxing stop, where you load up just enough to make it through next year.
I would recommend at least one simple summer promise to everyone - if you have to get up at a certain time the next morning, try to get to bed early at night.
I believe that if every ten Postman readers would take my advice, life in Estonia would be significantly better.
I'm going to follow my own advice.
We already have a Thursday working week, but not as we expect.
The office is open. Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians already have a Thursday working week they do not know they love.
But not as they expected, Business Day writes.
It's been created by modern office planning, or open office.
According to the Harvard Business Review, a well-known management journal, a worker in a Wall Street office needs about 1.5 hours a day, or nearly an entire day a week, of work.
But if Thursday's workweek is four working days and three holidays, then this forced solution is worse.
The 1.5 hours of working time is not a recreational time spent with family and hobbies or on holiday, but is filled with difficulty concentrating, confusion in working, increasing irritation and anxiety and the loss of employment.
The third day of the festival is a strong wind.
So the evening news got a troubled kayaker in front of the camera trying to fly through the wind.
Because of the windy weather, many festival visitors even lament that their mouths and eyes are filled with sand.
How a Man Built a $51 Million Theme Park for His Daughter
A father in Texas discovered that there was no theme park where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on a family vacation when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to make friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they're scared because they don't know how to treat a person with a disability -- Morgan has a five-year cognitive disability and a certain form of autism.
This incident haunted him.
"Morgan is a lovely young girl.
Meeting her always brings a smile to her mouth and she wants to hug no doubt.
But there have been many times when we haven't been able to take her to different places", she says.
Hartman and his wife, Maggie, asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere where she would feel comfortable and others would feel comfortable with her.
"We concluded that there is no such inclusive place", says Hartman.
So in 2007, he decided to build it himself.
The former real estate developer sold his home improvement business in 2005 to form The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that helps people with disabilities.
He then began the creation of "the world's first accessible theme park".
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do anything, where people with and without special needs can play", says Hartman.
He called together doctors, therapists, parents, and other disabled and unreached people groups to consult on the facility.
They were built on a 10-acre abandoned quarry in San Antonio, Texas.
Morgan's Wonderland Park cost $34 million and opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible viewing area, an adventure playground and a mini-course.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel with wheeled-chair-specific trailers that move up and down alongside the animals.
Hartman claims Morgan was initially afraid of driving.
"When we opened it, he didn't dare go to it.
He didn't understand why it was going around and why the animals were moving up and down", says Hartman.
It took Morgan three years to agree to go to the shell.
"At first he just stood there, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
It was a slow process, but now he loves to drive it.
Overcoming something that frightened him meant a lot to her.
The little things you accomplish in the games make a big difference".
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has been visited by over a million people in 67 countries and all 50 U.S. states.
One third of the staff are disabled and entry is free for anyone with a medical condition.
"I thought Morgan was one of the lucky ones, because he had a lot of things he needed.
I didn't want the price to be a barrier to other people with special needs", says Hartman.
"We open every year, knowing that we will lose at least a million dollars, and we have to earn it back with the help of our crops and partners".
This year, the theme park was expanded to include Morgan's Inspiration Island, a fully accessible water park.
"In July, fewer people visited the park because the wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to build a water park by the side", says Hartman.
Some parts of the island have used warm water to help visitors with muscle problems.
Waterproof motorised wheelchairs available, which operate by compressed air, not by batteries.
You can also take a boat on the river.
The total cost of the water park was $17 million (£13 million).
"Last night a man came to me on Inspiration Island and just held my hand", says Hartman.
"She pointed to her son who had serious special needs, and she began to cry.
She said her son had never been able to play in the water before".
Hartman says three out of every four park visitors are disabled, and the park has the exact impact he hoped for.
"It helps people understand that while we are different in some ways, we are actually exactly the same", she says.
"I saw one girl in a wheelchair go to another, needless girl and they started playing together.
It was really great".
Hartman has no plans to open any more parks, although he's received hundreds of letters in the mail and mail from people who would like to visit his neighborhood.
Instead, she focuses on providing educational facilities for young people with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organizations elsewhere that are trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland, and we will continue to work with them", he adds.
He keeps taking Morgan to the theme park, and Morgan's a celebrity in his own right.
"When he comes here, he's like a rock star!
A lot of people want to talk to her and take pictures with her, and she's good at it", says Hartman.
Morgan, now 23, is getting better and better.
"He is now more talkative, and most of his physical problems have been alleviated by numerous operations.
We are so proud that he has come this far".
When Morgan visits the park, he likes to play on the hills and on the beach, not realizing how much he's helped others.
"Morgan knows the park is named after him, but I don't think he understands what it really represents and how it has changed lives", says Hartman.
"He doesn't realize that the way he has handled things in life has made him a real inspiration".
U18 head coach Vaido Rego: play-offs may decide one or two
The Estonian U18s basketball team defeated Poland 68:63 in the quarter-finals of home EMI B division, according to head coach Vaido Rego, which was a real play-off meeting.
The game was rough.
Both teams had done their homework, the points were hard.
The game comes down to the fact that he has better nerves.
The play-offs could be a one-two draw", Rego said.
You can, but the coach always looks for something to fix first.
Nuriseda always gives.
Some of our mistakes were unjustified, the opponent got light free throws and lived on them.
We've had this before. If you're going to defend aggressively, there's a risk of overwork.
We will draw our own conclusions", said Rego.
He used nine players today, and Robin Stone, who missed a few games because of injuries, was still on the edge.
These decisions are made in the moment.
"The rock was accompanied by morning training and pre-game warm-up, but it was still not 100% ready", explained the instructor.
Tomorrow at 6:15 p.m. Estonia will face the United Kingdom in the semi-final, which today surrendered Bulgaria 76:73.
The winner of this game will be promoted to the EMI A Division for the next summer of his country's U18 age group.
Video: Vassilyev has already passed another penalty for the new club
Pias was eliminated in the ninth minute of the home-field game against Wrocław Sław, but was able to make the cut 20 minutes later.
Vassiljev had a great opportunity to secure the first win of the season for the Pistons.
Four minutes before the regular season, the quarterback passed the penalty.
The game ended in a 1-1 draw.
The two points of the four corners of the table are placed at the last, or 15th, position in the table of the table.
How do you keep sex exciting when you're trying to have a baby?
So it's very important to keep your keys in place even when you're trying to create a new life.
First Female gives advice on how to make sex not feel like a boring obligation.
Don't take it as a commitment.
It can happen to any couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it can take years to get pregnant.
Having sex after orders takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel that they cannot enjoy the "normal" sex cycle at the end of it when they know that it is not going to work out.
This creates tension in the relationship, which in turn leads to a decrease in sex, and less sex, of course, means even more chances of not getting pregnant.
Men, however, feel that they must be able to "sit" when they are required to.
If you know your fertile days ahead, it can help you plan something romantic with your dearest.
Whether it's a special dinner or just a time-out, enjoy each other!
Consider the fertile period.
From the point of view of reproduction, there is no point in having sex after ovulation, but to enhance your relationship, try to have sex on some fruitless days.
While there is no evidence that pregnancy will be more likely to happen if a woman has an orgasm, remember that!
Remember, every pair is different.
Everyone can handle stress from having a baby differently.
Some men want to be familiar with the woman's cycle, while others prefer not to know that they would not feel the pressure to "act on demand".
No one knows better than you what's best for you.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that couples who have sex every couple of days have a higher chance of success, but not every couple can maintain this density.
The most important thing is to find the pattern that suits you best as a couple.
IAAF warns cheating is being closely monitored at the World Championships in London
The World Championships in Athletics are starting in London on Friday, and athletes are more in the limelight than ever before about the doping scandal.
These World Championships are the first to be overseen by a new body, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and results forgery.
"It cannot be ruled out that human nature does not allow such things to happen.
But we can say that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping programme that can be found at this time based on information and data collection, and we'll see the results after the event", said David Howman, a spokesman for the AIU.
The IAU has allowed 19 athletes from around 190 Russian athletes who have been involved in drug trafficking to compete as neutral athletes.
Watching: Levadia destroys the Paide City Squad on the home field
Levadia has put herself in a difficult position because the previous win was lost to Viljandi's future in a surprising way by a stranger and table leader Flora seized the opportunity, slipping seven points away.
Behind the back, the same stick as Levi's, but it's the SpongeBob.
Paide, who was jailed during the summer transition period, continues to miss captain and midfielder Andre Frolov.
In the last seven games, only two points have been scored, ranking eighth in the table - four points down from Tartu Tamma and four points ahead from Future.
Leviat lost the first game between the two teams at Paide Street, 0:7 and 2:5.
"My watch died, but I didn't", said actor Raivo E. Tamme with a wide smile at the Ironman 70.3 finish.
True, during the entire half-triathlon, no smile ever left Raivot.
Even more, after running for 21 kilometers, he was caught in the crossfire: "I was talking to a man while running, and a man ran by and wondered, 'God, you still talk!'
Raivo, who shared the energy to talk, went over the runway a few times.
On the coach's advice.
"Ain-Alar Johanson said that walking up the mountain is okay, that there is no point in pushing the run because there are such climbs and that time and time make no difference whether you run or you run", says the actor, who took advice from the triathlon instructor.
He also had a breathing room during the walk, and the six-foot-tall was able to share interviews left and right without breathing after crossing the finish line.
It's like not a mile back swim, a mile bike ride, and a mile run.
"I think my training is also enough to make me enjoy this race", confesses Raivo, who started training in January and has now lost 16 pounds.
And as far as interviews go, it was my wish to be able to do the interviews after the finish.
I've been able to interview after every contest, and I was hoping it would be nice to be able to do that after Otepapi Ironman.
I thought that I would be fine if I didn't get to the bottom of the West Bank after Ironman". Rather, as Raivo crossed the finish line, he offered the opposite picture: hands facing the sky with victory and a genuine triumph.
There was also a reason: The train took 46 minutes and 24 seconds to swim the mile [1.9 km], three hours and 32 minutes to cycle the mile [90 km], and two hours and 18 minutes to run the mile [21.1 km].
"My heart is now in the triathlon", says Raivo, who already cried out in the final, adding that he gave the sport a ring and it took the ring to the fold.
I already registered on August 20th for Gran Fondo - 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartus on a bicycle!
So, we're training again tomorrow!
Disney longtime consultant and executive Marty Sklar has died at the age of 83.
Sklar, who died on July 27 at his home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, maintained ties to the company after retiring in 2009, exactly in time for the 54th anniversary of Disneyland's opening.
Last year, he became the only crew member (as the company calls its employees) to have participated in the opening of all 12 Disney parks around the world on Shanghai Disney's opening day in China.
And less than two weeks before his death, he was at the Disney fan meeting D23, sharing his memories of Disneyland.
His death was reported by the Disney Company, without giving a reason.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's position as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after graduating from U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's chief variator of advertising materials, dedications, memoir guides, speeches, poems, presentations, and short films, such as the script that helped the company gain approval to build Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also worked with Walt and his brother Roy on the annual Disney reports.
"These were quite turbulent times for a man who was just approaching his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years left of college", Sklar wrote in his autobiography Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms (2013).
But despite Walt Disney's reliance on Sklar's writing, he assigned Sklar to the Ford Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair, where the Disney Company designed exhibits and attractions.
Sklar wrote a story for Walt Disney for the Ford Pavilion attraction Magic Skyway, where he could see animated dinosaurs and co-humans and which was their primary link to major corporate sponsors.
This was the beginning of Sklar's second visit to the company.
As a member and leader of Imagineers, he was increasingly associated with the Walt Disney legacy, who died in late 1966, long before Walt Disney World opened in 1971 and Epcot opened in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at age 65, Sklar was re-awakened when he was told that the company's executives had not prepared a public speech, although "it was no secret that Walt was dying", as he writes in his autobiography.
Sklar said he felt embarrassed that he had to write a statement that Roy Disney would sign, but he realized that a lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had crippled the company's management.
"In reality, they were all scared to death", wrote Sklar.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
His father Leon was a teacher and his mother, a girl named Lilyn Fuchs, worked for Johnson & Johnson before the family moved to Long Beach, California when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had several temporary jobs, including working for Douglas Aircraft, as a garbage collector in a hamburger restaurant drive-in, and as a mail carrier.
But in May 1955, as his third year at U.C.L.A. was coming to an end, Sklar got a message calling Disney's marketing and advertising manager, E. Cardon Walker.
At the time, Sklar was the new editor-in-chief of the U.C.L.A. student newspaper The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked her to come to the office of the founder and editor of The Disneyland News for a job interview.
Walker said the theme park will be opening soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after 20 minutes of interviews.
But Sklar also had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I had been working there for two weeks and had to present the concept to Walt Disney", he recalled on the Disney Avenue website of the Pocket Voice.
"If it hadn't been for Walt, he would have thrown me out the door and hired a professional.
But fortunately, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
That was scary.
I had never worked at a professional level".
In the form of a sclarm, Walt Disney (and some other people) taught lessons at one point in the "Mike the Ten Commandments" theme park management manifesto.
The commands include, for example, knowing your target group.
Try to "get in the visitors' shoes" to experience the attraction they have.
Tell one story at a time for each attraction.
Theme-solving expert Bob Rogers once called Sklar "the puppet of the magician" - a role played by Mickey Mouse in Disney's "Fantasia" (1940) - because he had conveyed Disney's philosophy to three generations of designers.
Sklar is survived by her husband, Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard, and four grandchildren.
Sklar was a dedicated Disney executive.
He regularly wore three-piece Miki-Miire clocks (which showed him the time in Los Angeles, Paris, and Tokyo) and the Miki-Miire gold ring.
And he never forgot anything that Walt Disney had taught him.
When Disney Company developed the California Adventure Park Children's Area, Sklar reminded the planners to add activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had demanded.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed because Walt used to take his daughters Diane and Sharon to Griffith Park in a trailer", she told The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Dad had to sit on the parking lot and eat peanuts and popcorn until the kids were driving alone".
Police brought in over 200 people over the weekend.
Over 20 crimes were registered in the city of Pärnu during the festival days.
There's reason to associate about half of them with musicians, in addition to the use of violence, there were reports of heavy drug possession and two reports of drunk driving.
One hundred of the abuses initiated were mainly related to the possession or possession of alcohol-using minors or prohibited substances.
The letter was stolen and a public order violation.
The police department was brought in by security forces for various reasons.
About half of them were minors, and alcohol was the main reason for the police station.
Mullu had brought half the minors into the precinct.
The same goes for the removal of half a million people, perhaps as many as last year.
According to Andres Sinimer, head of the police department, the numbers above are promising given the large crowd.
As in previous years, we were thoroughly prepared for this weekend.
We've recruited additional forces from other prefectures, police departments and paramedics to ensure a prompt response.
Most of the situations were resolved by word of mouth and were satisfied with the interaction of the security forces with the citizens.
"It seems that some of the bad things were not there because we thought there were a lot of police officers in town", said Sinimer.
In his opinion, it was extremely positive that there were fewer minors who drank alcohol and that young people proved that partying is a desirable thing.
He extended his congratulations to the security company's top-notch team who took care of the security of the festival area.
I want to thank all the festival guests who politely stayed up and celebrated safely.
"I also thank the local people who, with their understanding attitude, helped to make the festival a success", the police chief said.
The police station is waiting for the owners of the property to find items from the city and the festival area this weekend.
According to Annika Pärna, head of the Pärnu service responsible for the return of the finds at the festival, less than a dozen items were lost this year.
The festival's police report returned more than half of the finds to the owners.
The most losses in three days were bank cards, IDs, cell phones and keys.
"At present, the owner is waiting in the department for 13 more mobile phones, three wallets, a laptop, a smartwatch and several car rentals", Pärna said.
A 101-year-old man jumped off a plane.
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military award to mark his world record-breaking falling skydive.
Named for a man who committed rape at 101 years and 38 days old, making him the oldest person to commit suicide.
The business group urges the government behind Brexit to agree on transitional conditions
One of Britain's biggest business lobbyists is urging the government to stop dancing around the periphery of Brexit.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) has asked the government to sign a 'transition agreement' to make progress with Brexit smooth.
It is recommended that the Government bridge the Brexit gap between leaving the EU and the establishment of new trade agreements.
The group warned that without such a contract, business would face a "short-term chaotic rock-solid shift".
They criticized the government for its "incumbency in all kinds of speculative disputes".
In recent weeks, members of the government have expressed conflicting views on how long the transition period will last and what it will bring.
The IoD report 'Brexit Closure - Opportunities for Transition' states: 'Instead of taking the issue far, the government needs to start a strategic debate on the issue.
This could minimize the growing confusion and uncertainty in the area.'
But this week, economist Gerard Lyons, a leading figure in the group Economists for Brexit, described concern about a "rock-and-rolling" Brexit as "a panic-mongering tale" that echoes the fear of Y2K's computer programming at the turn of the millennium.
Vice Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June: "There are a large number of business investments that will be postponed until companies have a clearer picture of what the likely outcome of their discussions is".
Allie Renison, EU Head of Trade and Development Policy, said: "The Chancellor has a right to worry about the scaling up of business investment.
This is one of the most frequently anticipated changes to be addressed in the context of Brexit, alongside the relocation of operations to the EU.
The latter applies in particular to members of the IOD in Northern Ireland who are currently considering moving together or relocating.'
The IoD offers a number of options, including the following:
Accession to the European Economic Area
The agreement to remain a long-term member of the EU legislature
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1295/2011.
Renison said: "The IOD offered these opportunities in the context of the transition, hoping that it would spark a debate on how best to end Brexit.
Prioritizing intermediate arrangements and thus mitigating risks of leaving the EU means that short-term chaotic fluctuations in the rock surface will not diminish future opportunities.'
Russian Railways exploring the possibility of a St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin railway
The Russian railway is investigating the possibility of running the Berlin-Petersburg line via Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad railway director Viktor Golomolzin told Interfax Severo-Zapat.
The travel traffic monitoring indicates that it is economically difficult to restore Kaliningrad-Berlin trains.
And we offer a second route, Berlin-Kaliningrad-Petersburg.
The technical possibilities for this are available in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock", said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also noted that Russian trains already exist that can change trains and continue to operate on European trains.
Golomolzin believes that this direction is a prospective one, since at present the inhabitants of St. Petersburg and the whole northern part of Russia must travel to Germany via Moscow and Breszt.
The possibility of a route through Latvia is being discussed, confirmed the Latvian Railways (Latvijas Dzelzceļš) press representative in Delphi, who said there was no concrete decision at the moment, but the option was being discussed.
The Latvian Railway is seeking, together with its partners, including the Russian Railway, an opportunity to increase competitiveness in the service of passenger traffic, so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistan prices No shelter in India
After 70 years of the greatest migration in history, which began with the separation of the two countries, prices are still moving from Pakistan to India.
In the camps of the two countries, tens of thousands of people who do not even have the legal right to work in India are already waiting for them.
So many have no choice but to illegally quarry near temporary settlements - Indian authorities are monitoring the movements of immigrants across the border with great care.
Most of those arriving from Pakistan can't expect such a reception.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
We worked in the fields, we were farmers.
But here, people like us are forced to cut rocks to make a living", said 81-year-old Jogdas.
For us, the breakup is not over.
The Indians are still trying to get back to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing", added an elderly man living in a refugee camp near the city of Jodhpur.
After India gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
The separation resulted in a month-long violent riot that claimed the lives of at least one million people because of religious hatred.
In the midst of bloody chaos, the prices and Sikhs rose from the newly formed Pakistan, but the Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite the extremes, prices remain one of the largest minority groups in Pakistan.
According to various estimates, they make up about 1.6 percent of the country's 200 million people.
Many of them complain of persistent discrimination and fear kidnapping, rape, and prostitution.
"The persecution began soon after the separation", said Jogdas, whose family moved to the areas of present-day Pakistan just months before the two countries parted ways to escape the drought.
Not a day has passed since we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back and live among my precious brothers.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's national government has said it wants to make it easier to seek asylum in India during religious persecution.
Last year, the government started allowing immigrants to apply for citizenship in their home country, before all the work was done through the central government.
The price of moving from Pakistan to India opens up the possibility of immediate citizenship after seven years in the country.
However, the process is often considerably more time-consuming due to red tape delays.
Khanaramji, 64, left Pakistan in 1997 and became an Indian citizen in 2005.
But many, he said, have given up and returned to Pakistan because they see that India does not have a good life ahead of them.
The government is not offering any support.
We're like animals without owners.
We are just trying to survive on our own", Khanaramji said.
But even worse than poverty is the skepticism of the authorities.
Those without citizenship must suffer harassment from intelligence agencies.
They are constantly being treated as suspects and Pakistani agents", he explained.
Singh Sodhal, who founded a charity in Jodhpur to help Hindus from Pakistan, had high expectations of Modi, who came to power in 2014, but for now he has had to be disappointed.
Under Modi's rule, tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated, causing the greatest number of migrants to suffer.
"Their lives are going to hell", Sodhal said.
But for many, such treatment is better than living in Pakistan.
Horoji fled to India with his two adult sons two years ago after receiving death threats from his Pakistani neighbors.
"We had to flee to India to save our lives", said 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents were from what is now India but found themselves on the wrong side of the border as the country was divided.
My grandfather was moving to the other side for work.
But he told us that we were moving to India at the right time, because he knew the future could be dangerous for prices.
I think we've been doing pretty well.
We have done our jobs and our tasks well", says Andres Sinimer, police chief of Pärnu, about the first two days of the weekend.
Sinimeri says that today, there are patrol officers and emergency responders on the streets and they also interact with people - maybe they have questions and they want to know how to become emergency responders.
In the last two days, the police have had to deal with some fights and drug cases.
"There have also been some high-dose drug deals, but we will make summaries after the weekend", says Sinimer.
The police department has searched about a hundred people in two days.
Fortunately, the police did not have to deal with extreme cases.
By the way, Sinimeri says that if it rains from the sky sharply and horizontally, they don't have much work to do.
A sheriff's deputy once said that rain is like an extra patrol.
The local police have also set up a headquarters in the weekend area where they can take found items and recover their missing items.
By the way, the police even lost one of their much-needed wines, which good people had been supplying to the bakery.
Look at the video that Andres Sinmer told the Evening Post.
Multi-Emmy-nominated writer and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West that has roots that stretch back to the atomic age.
The mid-century modernist style house was designed in 1945 by Josef Van der Kar and named after its original owners, nuclear weapons strategists Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter, as the Wohlstetter's house.
The 255-square-meter [255 sq ft] house, which is located by a gated driveway, has wide glass slides that open into the garden, terrace, and courtyard.
The living and dining room has basket floors, fireplace and reusable panels that open the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guesthouse on the property, which offers views of the giant fishery and sleeping terrace.
There's also a bathroom and an extra storage room in the separate building.
Albert Wohlstetter was an influential nuclear strategist during the Cold War.
Robert Wohlstetter's analysis of the intelligence revelations before the attack on Pearl Harbor was also cited by the 9/11 Commission.
The Wohlstetters have advised both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
They got the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is best known for his work on the television series "The Hospital for the Aged" and "In the Name of the Law: Sexual Offences Investigation Unit".
The real estate agents were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane of Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez of Keller Williams Realty.
The plane has drawn a perfect image of itself over the United States.
The pilot took the traveling plane to a cyclical international flight over the United States and even enjoyed a little fun on the route.
The actual flight history of the aircraft indicated that it was not just a straight line or curve, but a sequence of flight paths that formed an image of the aircraft connected to each other.
The Boeing 004 departed from Boeing Field Airport in Seattle at approximately 3:40 p.m. local time on Wednesday, according to Flightradar 24.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took an eastbound flight across Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before suddenly changing course and heading south.
As seen on the map, the plane's strange route is a two-engine jetliner.
Boeing said the flight is part of an 18-hour airworthiness test.
"Instead of flying a random sample, the test team took a chance on their imagination by flying a 787-8 for 22 states", a Boeing company spokesman told RT.com.
"The nose of the Dreamliner points to the Puget Sound area, home to Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
The wings extend from northern Michigan near the Canadian border to southern Texas.
Saba is about Huntsville, Alabama", he added.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was launched in 2009.
The aircraft can carry up to 242 passengers and can fly for more than 13 600 kilometres.
The pilot's use of radar as a personal distraction led to an immense interest among online flight attendants.
Some suspected it was a test flight, others suggested it might be a strange coincidence.
Multimoviees influencing the dress style of children in Estonia
While in Europe and America, children's clothing is often shaped by what they are wearing in royal or celebrity homes, Estonian parents choose clothing for their bridesmaids based on what happens at the cinema.
The little British Prince George is now the mother of a real mother, Duchess Cahterine.
Like his mother, the prince can fire people with his clothes into a real buying frenzy that has even gotten its own concept - Prince George effect.
The latest such incident occurred a few weeks ago during a visit by the royal family to Poland, where George wore a ten-euro blue-red striped shirt from the Spanish brand Tizza, which his crazy parents bought from the brand's e-commerce store in 24 hours.
There were probably not many Estonian shoppers among them, because the royal children's heads are supposedly left completely cold by our parents.
The head of communications at the department store, Anna Ansmitt, says that the children of star couples and the foreign fashion trends generally do not affect our parents' purchases of their models.
In Estonia, the largest directory of children's items is made up of films, multimedia and also YouTube channels.
The most popular products in recent years include buttons, frozen toys, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, eating penguins, and so forth".
However, she confirms that, if she wishes, her children can also dress like European princes or princesses in Estonia.
The Centre does not recommend the Savisaare Preparatory Union
The leaders of the Centre Party regions across Estonia addressed the public and their party members, inviting them to vote for the Centre Party, not for the electoral unions.
This message is especially for those considering the Edgar Savisaare Electoral Union and the Centre Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think of Princess Diana's makeup, the first thing that comes to mind is eye makeup.
A younger daughter's blue.
Later, a thick black line was drawn in his Martin Bashir's "Panorama" interview, which was devastating as he looked up through the thick ribbons, bringing to the heart the immortal phrase, "We were three in this marriage, so it was a little too crowded".
The big, wet eyes that were surrounded by his limp, the black stripes on his face, left him as a wounded animal.
That's exactly what he was trying to achieve.
But Princess Diana never wore any particular makeup outside the public eye, at least not by modern standards.
Not only did she not need it - she was naturally beautiful - but she saw in it a burden, something more about work than pleasure.
In public, she could wear a thick makeup.
Once she arrived at the office of the editor of Vogue, Conde Nast, wearing a thick, almost orange, goddess-like cream.
He apologized, saying that his skin must be like sunlight, because if he went out "as usual", the cameramen would take pictures of him and then make all the accusations that he looked "brown", "bright", and "tired".
That is why Diana used a solar bath three times a week, using a machine in her home.
Today, this would be disgusting for health reasons, of course, but for Diana it was a beneficial purpose - to show the world her sunny nature, though she was filled with dark clouds and glow.
Probably one of the royal family's biggest mistakes was thinking that if they approved of her as Charles's wife, they would get one of the most beautiful little relatives with only a sugar cane brain.
The reality was the opposite.
He may not have been the best in his class, but when it came to creating an image, he was definitely the fifth best.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey a mood or emotion.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have given him the slightest interest.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was the godmother of her youngest child - recalls that makeup was not something they used to talk about.
"I can only remember", she said, "how much relief he felt on those occasions when we went on vacation together and he didn't have to wear makeup".
Nowadays, we tend to think of makeup as something that enhances a woman's appearance, but looking back at Diana's life, it's clear that she used it as a powerful tool for relationship management.
Those moments when he felt most free, he was most himself, are those moments when he was also most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with her two young sons, at the Thorpe Park at Loggers Leap, she was a breakthrough and laughed from the heart, a hangover spread out under her eyes like any other mother spending a day with her children.
Four months after the news of her and Charles' departure, she finally looked defiantly restless and "normal".
Or later in life, pulling out of the gym, his hair back, his feet in a bike suit, his face red from training, his health and vitality blowing out of every hole.
Towards the end of her life, when she started to put her independence on the line and her self-confidence grew, we saw more and more of this Diana.
He joined the Halo Trust and walked through Angola's minefields in January 1997.
At that point, at age 35, with soft hair and natural, almost completely unmakeable, she was probably more beautiful than ever, reminiscent of that bright and hopeful young girl who smiled in her engagement photo 15 years ago.
Diana was just reaching her prime.
In ancient times, young Diana Spencer had a dreamlike pre-Raphaelite nature.
But it wasn't long before "princesification" began - a process that was primarily run by the press and the palace to make Diana a refined young girl worthy of her new status.
Part of it involved the handiwork of Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist who Lord Snowdon often used in photo scenes.
Howard first met the fearsome Diana at Snowdon's Kensington Town Hall to photograph the official engagement for Vogue.
At that point, in the late 1980s, Diana was just an empty lunch.
Her finest beauty products came from The Body Shop, like the Elderflower.
Howard used Max Factory's delight cream Sheer Genius with the tune of Honey Touch and Max Factory's frosted coral with the tune of Frosted Coral.
In the eyewear, she wore Elizabeth Arden's Rice and Timberland and white tablecloth on her eyebrows.
Elizabeth Arden's appearance was enhanced by a blue ribbon and blue counter-pull.
And we know all that because Howard designed a face design for her.
"Diana's eyes are so adorable in color that I wanted to emphasize their striking blue", she later wrote.
The result is not particularly appealing to such a young girl - she looks like an 18-year-old who is about to turn 50.
Her eyes are too tight and her eyes are too much dull brown.
But the most striking thing here is the infamous eye-catcher in the inner eyelid of this dazzling Disney princess in blue.
A fantasy play for a fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana's looking at us with a little bit of uncertainty.
One of Diana's concerns was that she never knew where a public figure would end and a private figure would begin.
That was the beginning of the process.
The person who probably influenced Diana's appearance most was Mary Greenwell, who still plays a prominent role in the modern world of makeup.
The makeup artist, who is now Chanel's ambassador, among others, remains one of the icons of the makeup world.
"Diana had incredibly beautiful skin and long legs", she recalls.
"She was just beautiful.
The men adored her.
She was sexy without trying".
Mary first met Diana in 1991 when Vogue celebrity Anna Harvey asked her to make a costume for Diana ahead of the December issue of one of the magazine's most prized photographers, Patrick Demarchelier.
The team included hairdresser Sam McKnight.
It happened when Diana and Charles' divorce was at its peak and the public support for the divorce was being given.
"They didn't tell us who it was, even though we knew it was someone very famous", Greenwell said.
"When we arrived, Diana was just standing there beautifully, warm and friendly and extremely excited to be on the cover of Vogue".
This canvas - Diana in a simple black dress, her lip leaning on her hands, her blue eyes wide open, her candle-length elegant French manicure, her hair cut short - was breathtaking.
It radiated positivity, individuality and elegance.
It was primarily modern, transmitting the minimalist aesthetics of the early nineties and creating a stark contrast between Diana and the royal family, who faced the "annus horribilis", as the queen later called it.
"Diana was very unobtrusive about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different", Greenwell said.
Over time, she taught Diana to make herself - cream, makeup, eye dressing, eyelashes - and emphasized a healthy skincare routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and follow the mantra of "inside beauty".
"Diana does everything in moderation", says Greenwell.
She slept enough and cut back on alcohol consumption, which is vital for fresh skin.
The princess preferred Guerlain's goddess creams, Clarence's lipsticks and the Clinique's Wild Rose as a treat.
But the greatest favor Mary did Diana was to take her out of the blue eyelashes.
"It just made him so much older", she said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones with brown lead lines on the ribbon, which were fused together, so that all the leaves were beautifully soft.
Often, he simply used a toned cream and a little sunscreen to emphasize Diana's healthy glow.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to her house to discuss products that I loved doing", Greenwell told me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; a chance to take a few moments for himself".
His favorite was the Clarins luxury brand.
Diana allegedly used their delicate skin cream for day and night and their Alpine herbal cleansing milk and toner.
She also regularly attended the beauty salon of Janet Filderman in central London.
Diana was famous for her beautiful skin, but she sometimes had pinkish, moderate jaw movements, often caused by stress.
To relieve this, he used natural soothing oils, including mustard oil.
"Diana had a wonderful skeleton", said Greenwell.
The only part of her appearance she wasn't very confident about was her nose.
Anna Harvey recalls: "Once, when the newspapers reported that she had had a nose job, she turned to me and laughed, 'Honestly, if I had had my nose, do you think I would have chosen that?'"
As Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnigh's advice began to take hold, Diana felt more confident about her new appearance.
One of his most memorable public appearances - in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he wore the famous "retribution gown", a challenging, revealing copy of the figure with the shoulders by Christina Stambolian - shows that he began to shape himself in the final years of his life as a signature artist.
With short hair and curly hair behind her ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, with her short hair in sharp contrast to a very challenging black silk dress.
Her makeup is perfect - appealing yet modest, black-eyed, highlighting the blueness of her eyes.
He was fearlessly wearing distinctive colors, especially red, a glossy red candlelight, most likely the Revlon Red, which became a trademark in some sense.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure at the launch of the Child Abuse Fund at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
The princess was a beacon of health and self-confidence.
And finally, he had complete control.
Sunny and in shape, her makeup is flawless, she gives exactly what she wants the viewers to think: here's a woman who seems to have finally found her place in life, and who, having just turned 36, has finally found her place.
It's a real shame he couldn't prove it to himself.
South Japan prepares for a typhoon to hit Norway
Much of northern Japan, including areas devastated by rainforests last month, was preparing for even more rain on Friday as Typhoon Norway, once the world's strongest storm this year, moved closer to the nation's main islands.
According to the Meteorological Office, strong winds and heavy rainfall will be expected from the southern island of Kyushu and from the southern island of Amami, about 1,300 miles south of Tokyo, Friday, and rainfall of up to 800 mm (9.5 inches) may be expected over the next 48 hours.
A meteorological agency spokesman said that Norway, which means a certain type of deer in Korean, would then likely turn north and rain over Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit by rains and floods last month, which killed 36 people and left four missing, are likely to survive the worst.
"It's an extremely slow storm", he added, noting that this is a higher risk of flooding because of heavy rainfall in one area over longer periods of time.
Norway, once a Category 5 typhoon and a traditionally long-lasting storm, first formed two weeks ago, circling along the northern Pacific Ocean before heading for the wild, targeting Japan and weakening its approach.
The representative added that depending on the change in course, Norway may move directly across Kyushu and then along the Japanese island of Honshu with the elections, but the long-term journey remains difficult to determine.
There are places on the land where, if necessary, even the best of intentions can't be reached by ordinary vehicles.
There's an ATV for the solution.
The ATVs in military service gave us an overview of the Protective House!
The use of typical lightweight and high-performance vehicles in military structures is nothing new.
The need for them was felt during World War II, but increased attention was paid to them a decade later.
Simplicity and Power
In 1956, Willys Overland was forced out of the mills under the name of the M-274, a development of the M-274 engine designed for evacuating wounded during the final years of World War II.
For further development, it's a little strange to call a mechanical mule a trucker.
It's hard to imagine a more agile vehicle.
Wheel platform, chair and chair: everything, all the luxury.
It was as if the overly sophisticated designers had taken the designs from the engineer's desk too seriously and started producing them in a raw way.
But war is far more permeable than comfort.
This category was not opposed to the mules tested in the jungles of Vietnam.
Hardly a lightweight machine weighing less than five hundred kilograms could be smashed into places where the legendary Willyse Jeep, with its super-breeding ability, was to display the brake wheels of a submissive.
The main use of vehicles with a carrying capacity of about 500 kg was for transportation, both for the transport of coal and for the transport of manure.
Another time, lighter, non-retroaction tank guns were mounted on the back of the mule.
But when this truck came down, and it did, the driver was able to move the steering wheel forward in the last hurdle and lower it so much that it could be driven on the belly slopes.
The Mulas were produced until 1970, with a total of 11,240 completed, and were in service in the army until 1980, when they were replaced by the HMMWVs, which had won the battle.
Over the next two decades, ATVs became more marginal in military circles.
They came back to life after the twin towers of the New York City subway collapsed and U.S. troops found themselves in the desert lands of Iraq and Afghanistan.
It was there that the knowledge and understanding that something was needed to fill the void between Humwee and the infantry was born.
Since ATVs generally do not provide a significant level of protection, they are not the best choice for direct combat.
But fast and light machines are suitable for special tasks.
Like in intelligence and rescue operations.
There are thousands of ATVs and UTVs in service in the U.S. military today.
Most of them, like the XUV550s purchased by the Defense Forces, are essentially similar to those in civilian service, but supplemented according to the needs of the army.
The brands that have been camouflaged include Kawasaki Mule, Honda Rancher and Foreman, Yamaha Rhino and Arctic Cat, and a growing selection of Polaris models from leading military ATV manufacturers.
In 2013, Polaris signed a five-year contract with the American Special Operations Centre (SOCOM) for the delivery of two-seat MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year contract for the single-seat MV850s, built on the basis of the Polaris Sportsman, with both infrared and black-out lights and innovative beehive tires that will ensure mobility even after the capture of a 50-caliber weapon.
Before the MV850 entered the market, Polaris was able to supply the military with MV700 and MV800.
The MV700 is a military version of the civilian Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, with front and rear axles, a two-part fuel tank for longer distances, a reinforced frame and base and some other military equipment that is not used for farmers or for forest hatters.
Like the John Deere M-Gators, which were used successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside the Polar ATVs, it is equipped with armor, a suitcase cap and some other elements used in beaches but essential in the battle zone.
A vehicle weighing 750 kilograms can carry almost half its weight, or more precisely, 570 kilograms of cargo.
The engine power is also sufficient to carry lighter trailers and artillery pieces.
The rear of the removable side of the box, with a shape-shifting case, allows the transport of luggage from point A to point B, which is smaller in size but larger than the thrown insect.
Later, they also produced an upgraded version of the M-Gator, the A1, which is 20 horsepower more powerful than the original 20-horsepower M-Gator, and a later reinforced frame, the A2, which is even better for weight lifting and bouncing, and the A3, which combines the positive properties of the A1 and A2.
The Tulerlists actually got the M-Gators back in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where medical brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they reduced the burden on soldiers who moved on their own feet by carrying goods that would otherwise have been carried on the market.
While most of the ATVs used in power structures are modifications from civilian vehicles, there are some exceptions.
Among the most notable are the Prowler-named warheads made by Phoenix International, which have been successfully used in all sorts of combat, intelligence and rescue missions around the world.
According to the manufacturer, they were first introduced 10 years ago and were derived from the narrow points of use for specialised vehicles, which are characteristic of ATVs in regular use and those modified for the military, in terms of both driving, endurance and safety.
However, while similar in construction and size to a regular ATV, the Prowler is totally different in both its construction and capacity.
It is faster, more durable, more stable, and can both tow and bear heavier loads than other similar vehicles.
For example, if the driver of a regular ATV is required to play with his body position constantly to maintain the balance of the vehicle and to use both hands to maneuver, accelerate and brake, driving a Prowler is more like driving a car.
But ultimately, it doesn't matter if it's a Prowler, Gator, MV850, or any other ATV or UTV -- they all have the same concept and use.
And it is clear that in a situation where defence costs are being reduced at a broad scale and smaller, targeted, shelling is being practiced instead of a broad conventional war, lightweight and fast small vehicles have joined the army to stay in service.
The section's survey revealed the details of the vulnerable children in care.
As a result of a disturbing breach of information, the mother of one child was wrongly sent personal data of the children in custody, including information on whether they were sexually active.
A table was emailed to the mother, containing the names of all the children in the care of a major service provider in Victoria, the date of birth, the location, and the specific concerns and places of interest.
The e-mail revealed the whereabouts of each child.
The list states that a 13-year-old boy has been released on bail for sexual conduct, that a 15-year-old girl with problems with self-harm, substance abuse and running is "out with a boyfriend" and "will not be back tonight", and that a 14-year-old boy needs help "to take care of himself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document shall contain notes on when some children are expected to return home or whether they may contact staff to assist them.
There are many disturbing details about some children.
A warning about a 15-year-old boy reads: "If staff contact you to obtain permission to search a room and/or a laptop/USB device on suspicion of unacceptable sexual material, that permission must be given".
The document also states that for a 17-year-old girl who is only 18 when she turns three months old and is released from a care facility, the risk of suicide is so high that staff must call the emergency department immediately if she escapes.
A 16-year-old parole officer was quoted as saying that he was out and "contacted the staff later to pick him up".
Although only the name of the accommodation where the children are kept and not their addresses are mentioned in the locations listed, there is still enough detail to be able to locate them.
The 2015 report came out when the mother shared with Fairfax Media her experience of communicating with the Department of Health and Human Services and Child Protection since taking care of her daughter four years ago.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had turned 18 and left the system.
The heartwarming decision to give up her daughter to child protection was made after a violent incident at home, one of the growing complaints of domestic violence by parents against their children.
For example, her daughter was able to get seven criminal charges within six months of leaving home, moved hundreds of miles away from home and into a settlement where she seemed to be making a success of herself, but then moved back without her parents' knowledge, and her two daughters and her older brother were accepted and facilitated by her caregivers.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, a 17-year-old who was allowed by the nursing home to stay regularly at a local hotel for her 15-year-old daughter at the time, ended when the young man was charged with having sex with a child a few days after turning 18.
"Why did he leave the system in a worse situation than when he entered it?" asks the mother.
"And does that happen to all the children in foster care?"
He strongly supports the creation of an institution that would allow the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children during the first weeks after they are taken into care before they are moved to their homes.
This would enable them to better understand how children interact with others and the dangers and needs associated with them, especially in education.
The State Government is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in home care, in an effort to better support their parents, among other things.
The solid-line aid packages, funded over four years for $62 million, are designed to help move children from home care to better-organized situations.
In addition, a two-year, $5.6 million experiment, released last October, will provide professional caregivers to at least 28 children to help them escape or avoid caring.
According to a department spokesman, no official information was provided when the leak occurred, although the mother claims to have informed the two department employees within months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyze the case.
"Every alleged leak of private data is taken very seriously and we are working to ensure that it does not adversely affect the young people involved".
Last July, Minister of Family and Children Jenny Mikakos ordered an independent review of a selection of privacy incidents that took place over a five-year period.
The Department has therefore agreed to the seven recommendations submitted and has since updated the Child Protection Guide to ensure that staff have a clear understanding of their roles and privacy-related activities, modified IT systems to prohibit the automatic collection of certain personal data, and officially reviewed the privacy-related activities of the Department.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia is accused of widespread money laundering violations
The Australian government filed a lawsuit against the country's largest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank, on Thursday, alleging widespread violations of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules.
Financial Intelligence Agency AUSTRAC has disclosed that it has brought a civil action against CommBank in federal court for "a serious and systematic mismatch" in Australia's largest case of its kind and the first to involve a major bank.
"CommBank's conduct in this case has left Australian society unprotected from serious and persistent financial crime", said AUSTRAC in the court document.
Commonwealth Bank said in a statement that it would investigate the allegations closely and respond "when the time is right".
The largest Australian mortgage lender failed to disclose "in due course or not at all" suspicious circumstances "in respect of transactions totalling more than A$77 million (US$61 million)", AUSTRAC reported.
The Agency claims that the Bank has committed 53 700 infringements of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing act, in particular in relation to so-called smart ATMs.
The previous largest such case was earlier this year with Australia's most popular betting broker Tabcorp Holdings, which had only 108 alleged infringements.
Tabcorp paid a fine of A$45 million, the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.
A representative of AUSTRAC declined to comment on the possible sanctions imposed by CommBank or whether other banks may be in the agency's line of fire.
The maximum penalty for breaching the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing law is A$18 million for the offence.
Smart ATMs are a specific type of ATM that accept cash and cheque deposits and facilitate anonymous cash deposits.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor protection scheme in the form of a private investor guarantee.
The cash contribution amounted to A$5.8 billion in the six months preceding June 2016, compared to A$89 million in the first six months after CommBank's automation.
AUSTRAC claims in court documents that the cash deposits were made under false names, so the proceeds went to imported synthetic drugs.
'Even after CommBank's attention was drawn to suspected money laundering or 'smurf' in Commbank's accounts, CommBank did not begin to monitor its clients to facilitate and manage money laundering and terrorist financing,' the court documents show.
AUSTRAC added that CommBank accounts were also used for 'money laundering', a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries without the need for money to actually cross international borders.
The Nordea-DNB Joint Bank will become a reality by the end of the year
The merger of DNB and the Nordic Baltic entities into the Luminor financial group will not take effect until the last quarter of this year, the Business Day reports.
Opening doors in a single legal body has been pushed back.
Following the disclosure of the merger plans last summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could be delayed until the second quarter.
But in April, the DNB communications director said the matter would be postponed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority has provided additional guidance for Luminor to implement in the light of the regional importance of the Joint Bank.
Trump called New Hampshire "narcotics", angering state politicians.
"The president is wrong", said New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu.
It's a disappointment that his misreading of the epidemic ignores all the great things the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, called the comments "dismissal" and said on Twitter that her state is no different from others who are fighting widespread opioid abuse.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, also a Democrat, agreed.
"It is totally unacceptable for the president to speak of NH in this way", he tweeted.
It's a complete misrepresentation of NH and the epidemic.
Opioid addiction, a class of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl, is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history.
Drug overdoses killed more people in 2016 than gun or car accidents -- an estimated 59,000 people, according to data analyzed by The New York Times -- and are now the leading cause of death among Americans under the age of 50.
In 2015, the Office of substance abuse and mental health reported that more than 97 million people in the United States used prescription painkillers.
An estimated 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not prescribed by a doctor.
New Hampshire has gotten a tough hole, and its residents raised the issue repeatedly to presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
In New Hampshire, an estimated 470 overdose deaths occurred in 2016, compared to 439 in 2015.
In 2012, there were 163 of these, according to statistics from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.
On Thursday, Sununu described the opioid epidemic in an email as "one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced".
He said the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery.
He said the state has also spent millions of dollars on child prevention programs, law enforcement to end drug trafficking and initiatives to make the recreation area more accessible for overdosing.
We're looking for drivers in connection with the rape of two girls in Witton.
Police are trying to track down two drivers in connection with the rape investigation of a 14-year-old girl.
A teenager was attacked in the Witton area of Birmingham on July 26 at about 2:00 am (BST).
Before that attack, she was raped at the Witton station.
In connection with the first case, a man has been charged.
The British Transport Police are looking to speak with two drivers as part of their investigation.
Police say the first car is a brightly colored sedan.
Senior investigator Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before another person picked her up and then raped her in the car.
We want to know what was said during that conversation, and we want the director to know important details that will help us in our investigation".
The driver of the second vehicle, described as a red VW Sharan, probably brought the victim home after she was raped a second time, police said.

Still, you're busy trying to get other people to act tough.
You could forget your worries and go out with your dearest.
Take time for yourself to enjoy each other's company in some sweet, romantic place.
You're gonna burn yourself out, make big plans, maybe make promises... that just come to mind a second later.

Your feelings may not depend on what is happening now but on things that have happened in the past.
Even in difficult situations, you can act quickly and wisely.
You may be able to help someone out today because you have wisdom and determination.
You'd better stop worrying about money and business.
Take time to rest and relax.

Why do dogs see grass?
Sometimes it's thought that a dog eats herbs when he's not feeling well and wants to vomit.
In fact, most drug-eating dogs are completely healthy.
Fewer than 10 percent of dogs who see grass do so because of some disease.
One reason a dog may suddenly start eating grass may be a poor food table.
Even those dogs with worms may be more interested in grass biting.
Thus, if a dog who has never chewed grass has a sudden appetite for grass and eats it often, it is worth checking with a doctor to quickly identify a possible gastrointestinal problem, for example.
It is worth mentioning that a dog may eat grass because it tastes good or just gets bored.
If a health problem is ruled out, it is worth making sure that the family's pet can still get enough developmental and emotional activity.
From the west, the sun's clouds are coming to Estonia.
In northern Estonia, there have been reports of noise and individual flashes of lightning.
This afternoon, the weather service also issued a flash warning.
Today, mostly in northern Estonia, there are several parts of the country.
The lightning clouds are moving rapidly from west to east.
"North winds can reach as high as 15 inland, 18 m/s on islands and coastlines, but may be accompanied by stronger winds with the blast", says the Weather Service's website.
However, a much stronger thunderstorm is blowing in southern Finland and Russia east of St. Petersburg.
Fortunately, winds in Estonia are blowing from the west and south, so there is no risk of major storms coming at least initially.
Sylvester Stallone is making a guest appearance in the second season of "Our Life".
Executive producer Dan Fogelman announced on Thursday at the Television Critics Association press conference at a forum on the series that Sylvester Stallone will step down in the run-up to the second season of NBC's popular drama.
The actor will be a guest star in the filming of the season premiere as Kevin (Justin Hartley).
"Kevin's in a big movie, and we needed a big supporting actor", Fogelman said.
At the end of last season, Kevin was hired to play a major role in a film directed by Ron Howard that was a flashback to the series.
This season, we'll see the character participate in the project while also warming up to his relationship with his ex, played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to Fogelman, Stallone is "a father figure in a movie starring Kevin".
"Our Lives" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Hartley's father in the series' previous shots, played Stallone's son in the 2006 film "Rocky Balboa" as a coincidence.
Fogelman said that Ventimiglia's still thriving friendship with Stallone was likely what helped attract the big star to the series as a guest star.
"We have a great scenario for him.
I think it's going to be really exciting", Fogelman said.
Our Lives is back on the air on September 26th.
In the United States, two elite college employees were arrested after a state manhunt.
Wyndham Lathem, 42, a Northwestern professor, turned himself in to the police in California after the police searched for him.
Andrew Warren, 56, an Oxford University employee, was caught by police in San Francisco.
The man is suspected of brutally stabbing 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment in Chicago late last month.
A few days later, the suspects donated a large sum of money to a library under the name of the deceased.
Before he turned himself in, according to a Chicago police officer, Latham sent a video to friends and family about the biggest mistake of his life.
CNN didn't see the video, and the police aren't going to release it.
Police said it was a brutal murder and his body had been altered by his injuries.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from the UK, but investigators have yet to determine whether or how he was familiar with the victim.
Before the arrest, both suspects had fled the state.
Elise Christie talks about how she got over the horrors of Sots and cyberbullying to whisper in the name of gold again.
Compared to this hot-tempered young woman who recently considered saying goodbye to the ski resort, 26-year-old Christie has become a total stranger.
The bad ones offended him, especially because he was bullied at school in West Lothian as a child.
Now he's packing up his confidence and believing that the ordeal can go back to square one, bringing at least one gold to Pyeongchang.
"I definitely want to go out as an Olympic champion", he says, not afraid to specify the goal.
"I feel that I am physically and mentally at the right place to handle it".
She once dreamed of a career as a beauty queen until aesthetic elements began to diminish her interest.
"I was a very good jumper, but I had a hard time with the artistic side of things", she said with a laugh.
"I was not very good in elegance, decency.
It was a reasonable choice, for short-term exercise is the best fit for my personality".
A woman walks the earth: my daily budget is $5!
Honestly, I've had this experience, forty days, in the South of France, where I decided to live a life of "crowd" to just be free and live one day at a time.
You were staying in a tent, in the woods, in the stations of a small town, etc.
The other week, I joined a French homeless man, 44-year-old man who was...
Oh, don't think of it as some kind of pedophile thing, like we just spent the night at the same park in Menton and became friends, even though he was 15 years older than me, and he was a good sociable guy.
Turns out the man is from a good family, Paris, a former French naval officer.
The Alkot doesn't consume, doesn't make mistakes, in a word, a decent person, intelligent, pleasant communicator, life-threatening.
In a word, I joined him and we spent the next three weeks going from town to town together, and about five euros a day for food.
The money came, as long as you lived.
He taught me how to help out in the evenings on the terraces of closed hotels and restaurants and on the farms that are on the way.
We worked so hard that we could get food for the next two or three days and then...
At some point, I got a fever and decided I couldn't take it anymore.
I flew to Helsinki, from there to home.
And by the way, I'm sorry.
Those 40 days were probably the best days of my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three sound effects from a mosque was burned alive, reports Hungarian news agency MTI.
On August 1, a thirty-year-old thief with loudspeakers emerged from the mosque in Bekasi, near the capital Jakarta, but the temple guard noticed him and shouted, "Catch the thief!"
Tuldi helped me and immediately began to track down the thieves.
He ran off on a motorcycle and even swam across the river.
The pursuit lasted for a few miles, and one of the pursuers hit a rock in the back of the head, causing serious injury.
A furious pursuer caught the thief and beat him to death.
A stalker stole gasoline and set it on fire.
The unsub died of burns at the scene.
The body was taken to East Jakarta Police Hospital.
Police seized both the dead motorcycle and stolen sound effects.
Local press reports initially appeared as if it were not a thief but an electrician who wanted to repair the sound systems.
But the police were decisively opposed to these claims.
The owners of the firehouse said they would not comment on the incident.
According to the German news agency dpa, the reason for this move is the fact that Indonesians have little confidence in the police or the judiciary.
Indonesia is the world's largest Islamic country.
Out of 255 million people, 87.2% are Muslims.
Australian cuisine: from a finger to a schoolyard.
Aboriginal food in modern Australia is a direct descendant of finger meat and beef.
British roots have also had a profound effect on the local food supply - Vegemite, a dark brown salted beer brewery that is served with a sponge or a crack, as the British Marmite.
Meat pies, or leafy meat pies, served with boiled potatoes and watermelon, are also from Britain.
BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, are also available in the United Kingdom, whereas British sausages are more likely to be baked in an oven.
One local sweetener is the Pavlova Bezetort, although it is also called their invention by the New Zealanders.
The sweetness is still loved by the coconut- and peanut-flavored Anzac crackers and the coconut-flavored lamington's.
Honey Joys, or the joy of the mummy, are called honey-country honeybees.
Australian culinary celebrity Stephanie Alexander and her life's work, the home cook's cookbook "Cooking Companion", which is at least half a million Australian homes. / Blake Storey, Prime Creative Media
This fall, Stephanie is celebrating her 77th birthday.
His father was a civil servant and his mother Mary loved food very much.
Stephanie studied library science at university, and as is the custom among young Australians, she went to Europe after her studies.
While traveling in France, Stephanie's love of food only cemented and developed.
In London, however, she met her first husband, Monty, from Jamaica, and they returned to Australia to open a simple restaurant in Melbourne, The Jamaican House, in 1964.
Ten years later, the marriage broke down and the restaurant closed.
In 1976, he opened the somewhat more affluent Stephanie's Restaurant, which for the next 21 years was one of Melbourne's most expensive restaurants.
The landmark restaurant is still referred to as Melbourne's first fine dining restaurant, which really appreciated fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - a fact that now seems unusual, but not at the end of the last century.
Since retiring from the restaurant in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks, 15 of which have appeared in her magazine.
There are more productive food writers in Estonia, but for her no book was simply a recipe book.
The Australian home cookery has been replaced by Stephanie Alexander's cookbooks.
But she has a fifth cookbook, The Cook's Companion, her life's work, which is now in the homes of at least half a million Australians.
The book was first published in 1996, with an expanded edition in 2004, and a revised edition in 2014.
In my library, this 2004 outdoor book takes up quite a lot of space, because this impressive book contains about a thousand recipes on 1126 pages!
The newest version is even more compact.
Stephanie Alexander's life: "The Cook's Companion" is in at least half a million Australian homes. - Amy Piesse
This is a true cookbook that includes recipes for the purchase and storage of various ingredients, introduces cooking techniques, and recommends kitchen appliances.
The food is in alphabetical order, and the book contains many cross-references - evidently not a complete failure of the food writer's library education.
Stephanie herself insists that it was this book that changed her life and set a new course for future endeavors.
The book's popularity, the feeling that it had something to give to the people, led to the next big, greenhouse project, which in our case is comparable to a schoolyard.
The fourth Estonian person to have a heart attack in Finland.
Doctors at the Northern Estonian Regional Hospital (PERH), including cardiac surgeon Günter Taal and cardiologist Pentti Põdra, who worked with Finnish doctors, estimate that the post-operative period has been expected.
"It's very difficult to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart", said Puder.
Doctors say the world now has a maximum of eight years to live with a heart bomb.
The man himself is recovering and not ready to talk about it.
He was first diagnosed with heart failure two years ago, and the disease was already in its final stages, causing his heart failure to become ischemia.
'For this patient, transplantation was the only option,' added Taal.
According to the cardiac surgeon, the patient no longer has the batteries or a guide that accompanies the heart pump after the transplant.
All he'll have left is herbs that will kill his stomach and his immune system.
The patient can play sports and generally live on as a normal person", he said.
First year is the most dangerous.
The doctor added that it would take three to six months for a complete recovery.
Both doctors say that the patient should be monitored regularly for medicines and that medicines also have side effects.
In addition, the patient must be checked to avoid an uplifting reaction of the donor organ.
The first year is the most dangerous, but according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, 50 percent of patients will live for more than a decade.
Taal said that the results in Helsinki are better and the longest lived with a heart transplant is 25 years.
The cardiologist explained that because of the disease, the patient's blood circulation was poor, he had a heart pump put in a year ago that helped him to have surgery.
When the pressure in the man's lung dropped, he became a suitable candidate for transplant.
The transfer operation is not considered a very complicated part, as Italy considers: timing is very important.
"It took a lot longer to get the pump and then get the heart than to put a new heart in", he said.
In addition, the cardiologist brought out extra-corporeal bleeding as a complicated part of the operation.
Rather, he said, heart transplants can be considered rare, because Estonians need them the least.
The most frequent use of the mark is for kidney, liver and lung transplants.
Well, I know there's always excitement in a rare cut, but we've been practicing it for years.
Learning to know yourself and your nervous system is an art in this profession", Taal added.
We need four more people to get the organ.
According to the patient, the patient received a heart because the organ was not suitable for any other patient living in the Scandiatransplan community.
Scandiatransplant is an organ exchange organisation with members in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are four other people on the list for heart transplants in Estonia at the moment.
"These are still counted patients", Puder insisted.
Tal says the longest wait is for big men with a heart-to-heart 0-positive blood type.
"It's been about six months in Finland", he said.
There are conditions for having a heart.
"A woman's heart usually doesn't fit a man's, a big man's heart a little one's, and so on", read the cardiologist.
How to finance the company's vehicles?
In a changing consumer society, the financing of vehicles by businesses has expanded - in addition to the routine, more and more companies are using a full-service lease or, rather, a longer-term authorisation.
The leasing and rental of a vehicle are two clearly different financial transactions involving different obligations and expectations, but which nevertheless often create confusion.
Villi Tõldi, sales and marketing manager of AVIS Estonia, an international carrier, estimates that companies are increasingly moving towards full-service leasing and that long-term leasing is increasingly being used.
The truth raised the key questions that can be answered in choosing the right way to use the vehicle.
How long to use the vehicle?
The biggest difference between renting a car and leasing it is the time it takes to use it.
'It is worthwhile to make the listing for long-term use of the vehicle if the company has a plan to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period of time,' explained Tõld, adding that it is worthwhile to decide whether to own the vehicle, to lease full-service or to lease long-term if the vehicle is intended to be used as a service, i.e. to use the car on a daily basis, but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider and renouncing the acquisition at night.
'The rental car has a much shorter life than the lease period, but many major car rental companies also offer a long-term rental car where rental is done without complicated contracts and free guarantees,' Trold explained the various rental car options.
Who's gonna own the car?
At the end of the rental, the tenant will own the car.
'In the case of a re-service lease, it is possible to continue leasing at the end of the lease period on the same or better terms, replacing a new vehicle equivalent to the needs of the company,' he said, stressing that as the consumer society increasingly moves towards service-centric consumption, vehicle ownership is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, in the case of a full-service lease, it is also possible to purchase a car on the basis of a wish and agreed terms.
However, the rental option is not available and is only paid for the period of use.
Car leases are usually carried out at the representative offices of car companies and car rental is carried out at the rental office of the rental companies.
While the representations of the car companies are primarily involved in the sale of vehicles, they also offer the possibility of leasing and, in some cases, authorisation.
Rental companies have cars for the sole purpose of renting them out.
The truth is that the rental service is used for different reasons - many companies rent business vehicles, and it is convenient to use the service when booking or on holiday or when your car is being repaired.
'For commercial vehicles, there is an increasing shift towards a full-service contract offering the customer transparency of costs, timely savings in the vehicle purchase, use and return process and greater convenience,' the sales and marketing manager explained the growing tendencies in the tendering process.
Each year, more and more companies use full service leases for their fleet, thus optimising their spending and focusing on their core business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
If the leased car is subject to mandatory helmet and road insurance, the rental car is usually covered by basic insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether to add, for example, accident insurance, theft insurance or full insurance. "But compared to the usual service lease, the customer gets more heat than the equivalent, because in addition to the vehicle and insurance, regular car maintenance, day-to-day maintenance assistance, tyre changes and other agreed services are also covered", explained Tõld.
'If any new vehicle can be used for the normal tendering, in the case of a full-service tendering, the service provider helps to select a vehicle that meets the needs and needs of the company, which also takes into account the functions of use', he compared, stressing that the full-service tendering will certainly help to optimize the costs associated with the company's fleet.
'However, the choice of commercial vehicles depends on the car park of the service provider - different rental companies offer small and economical vehicles for urban transport and luxury sedans for business in their fleet,' explained Tõld.
Of course, during frequent rental periods, the desired car may already be rented out, but booking the desired vehicle in advance will help.
When choosing between leasing or renting, it is important to first clarify your objectives - how long you want to use the vehicle and what are your long-term plans for the car.
It is also worth taking a closer look at the various terms and conditions of the services.
At a press conference yesterday, the member of the National Assembly, Olga Ivanova, who joined the Savisaare Electoral Union, said that the Savisaare Electoral Union offers the Centre a competitive environment in the autumn elections in Tallinn.
But how likely is Edgar Savisaar to cooperate with the Urmas Serengeti electoral alliance "Tegus Tallinn"?
A United States Navy veteran was ordered to remove the American flag from the mailbox
The dispute between the United States Veterans' Association and the Florida Homeowners' Association is centered around a U.S. flag-shaped mailbox.
U.S. Marine Corps officer John Ackert says he received a letter last week from the Tallahassee Southwood Residential Association asking him to remove a postage stamp or face punishment.
He told WCTV he wasn't going to surrender without a fight and has appealed.
"I'm going to treat this, frankly, as bullying", Ackert said.
And I think people should fight bullying in any form, especially this kind.
Ackert said the homeowners union claimed that his mailbox was not in line with Southwood's aesthetic values.
U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said he was ordered to remove the cover of his mailbox from the American flag.
"As the end of the season draws near, we ask you to remove the American flag from the mailbox", the letter continued.
The cosmetics may be out 30 days in advance and must be removed within 15 days at the latest.
He said he's been out for four years.
It was put in there 30 days after we moved in.
Messages to the Southwood Community Association were not immediately received on Thursday morning.
A neighbor of Acker told WCTV that the letter was a little harsh and that they were not particularly surprised by the actions of the Homeowners' Union.
"They do things like that all the time", said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why can't you be patriotic in your own country?
Mike Patel said, "He's a veteran who served our country.
It's just a mailbox with a flag.
I don't think that's right.
The house belongs to him, at least he could afford it.
The letter from the homeowners union says that Acker has 15 days to remove the enclosure, otherwise he will face a fine.
He has not received an answer to his appeal.
Vietnam "regrets" the kidnapping charge by Germany
Vietnam said on Thursday it regretted comments by the German Foreign Ministry accusing the Vietnamese intelligence service of kidnapping a former Vietnamese oil company wanted in its home country on charges of embezzlement.
German authorities believe Trinh Xuan Thanh was taken from Berlin, which left a Vietnamese intelligence unit on Wednesday for 48 hours to leave the country.
Thanh is facing embezzlement charges, which, if convicted, will carry the death penalty.
He sought asylum in Germany, but his application was not yet ready when the Vietnamese authorities demanded his extradition.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters that the comments were "extremely regrettable" and Thanh surrendered himself to police in Vietnam on July 31.
"Vietnam has always been important and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany", he said, without going into details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after he was initially charged with misconduct at a subsidiary of state-owned oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, which caused about $150 million in damages.
The Vietnamese police issued a warrant for his arrest in September.
In March, the police launched an investigation into the acquisition in connection with his alleged involvement in a real estate development project.
Thanh was Chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior government positions, including Deputy Chairman of Hau Giang Province in the southern Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was released from the Communist-led legislature a month before its first session.
He was also expelled from the Communist Party.
The Vietnamese ambassador to Germany was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and informed that Germany demanded the return of Thanh in order to ensure the proper implementation of asylum and extradition procedures.
The bus driver rescued eight puppies from the side of the road, not knowing that the dogs actually had an owner.
"Where I put these eight puppies, I would have been thrown out of my apartment by a woman and her dogs", joked bus driver Oleg, who rescued the dog puppies who were circling the roadway unattended by handing them over to a shelter worker.
Soon, however, a dog owner of the shelter appeared, and he was puzzled as to why the puppies were taken away from his home.
Oleg, a bus driver in Harjuma, said that he had been working as a bus driver since the early 1990s, but that he had never had such an incident in his career.
Near Harju-Cross, I noticed something small running around the road.
I thought it was a hound, but it turned out to be four puppies", recalled the bus driver.
Oleg's heart was broken and he stopped a bus full of passengers to pick up the puppies.
"They were going to be overrun by cars and run over by dogs", Oleg said.
He added that the passengers were reasonable and that they also enjoyed the tender puppies.
The puppies were a little scared at first, but then they became fun.
Puppies on board, bus driver moved to new circuit because the schedule needed to be followed.
Once again, he was driving past the puppy's find and saw four other little dogs.
It was German Sheepdogs.
They were so quick, and you could see they were being taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful, they were awesome.
The first thought, of course, was that someone wanted to get rid of them for a reason", the bus driver said, explaining that he decided to pack the puppies for the bus.
"I also picked up the four puppies and called the police", Oleg recalled.
The bodyguards contacted the Tallinn Animal Shelter, whose staff came to the puppies from the Baltic station.
But was the bus driver tempted to take a hairball?
That's the idea.
One puppy was so beautiful and calm.
"He sat up nice and like a grown dog", Oleg said.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
My wife would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs.
We have another little kid.
"Please take the dog", he added.
Eve Tobias, head of the Tallinn Animal Sanctuary, confirmed that the sanctuary was actually a home for eight German Sheepdogs, two and a half months old.
But the same day, the owner came for the puppy.
"We didn't even shape those puppies in and just give them back", he noted.
"The dog owner wasn't very upset, but he did say that they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have come and asked if the puppies were theirs", Tobias said.
The shelter director added that it was good that the bus driver picked up the pimps that had been stolen along the road and that they were not involved in an accident.
In fact, the bus driver was so nice to have him react!
A Jordanian court has sentenced three U.S. servicemen to life in prison for the murder of three U.S. soldiers.
Last year, a Jordanian military court of appeals sentenced three Jordanian soldiers to life in prison for dropping three U.S. military cadets.
A military court sentenced Senior Sergeant Marik al-Tuway last month to life in prison with hard labor for killing Americans at the entrance to a South Jordan air base.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on an American caravan, claiming he feared an attack on the base.
But after the decision was released, the security camera video showed that he continued shooting even as two Americans hid and waved their hands to stop the shooting.
Hala Akhbar, a news site linked to the Jordanian military, announced on Thursday that a five-judge military appeals court upheld al-Tuwayha's sentence.
James Harrison spends about $300,000 a year keeping his body in toy shape.
Every NFL player depends on his body to make a living.
That is why many other athletes invest a lot of money in body care and rehabilitation to stay in top shape.
Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com looked closely at how far some veterans are willing to go to extend their careers.
But none of these cases are more extreme than the 39-year-old James Harrison, a defensive back for the Pittsburgh Steelers coming into his 14th season.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends an average of $300,000 a year on needle care, massage therapy, chiropractic and cups.
Most of the costs are related to travelling across the country to meet with specialists.
"I don't have to keep a bill for this kind of thing", Harrison said.
"When you compare the amount I earn with my expenses, the expenses are worth it, considering how I feel".
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate at the Steelers, estimated his body care at $200,000 a year.
Mitchell, 30, has been testing body tempering, which Fowler described as "using 55 pounds of metal as a massage routine".
"Instead of rolling on it, they're rolling on you", Mitchell said.
"If you have a tight spot on your foot and they start moving that thing around, it sometimes hurts.
But when you get up, the tension will go away.
It just puts the pressure out".
They're willing to make extra efforts, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend an average of $50,000 a year recovering.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons for the New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed regret that he didn't spend more.
"If I could go back, I'd invest even more", Cofield told Fowler.
"I'd probably spend at least twice as much.
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career.
In the end, it might have been a little help from more procedures".
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old linebacker, has expressed his willingness to step down from his veterans following in the footsteps of his Steelers teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and earn an additional three million by playing, that's a pretty simple decision", Shazier said.
As far as long-term careers go, investing in the recovery of players is far more sensible than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player is lucky if he can play longer than 30 years old, it's more likely that Harrison's success will convince his colleague to shift his spending to another.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
Weekend Festival Baltic boss Gunnar Viese tells the evening newspaper that the festival started years ago in Finland and its owners went to expand to see the beach under the Riya side, but on the way back stopped in Pärnus and the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says they're aiming for 25,000 visitors a day, but tibus are only counted after the festival.
The preparations for this party began in September.
"We were told by the city that the building was starting on the previous site, and that the hotel was coming", says Gunnar, who was facing a change this year.
There's no drop in there right now, but I guess if the drop didn't go down this year, it'll go down next year.
So maybe we should have moved out sometime", he explains why this year's festival has moved.
They're planning the festival all year long.
Between a thousand and a half thousand people work on the weekend - police officers, a team of organizers, volunteers, merchants, security teams, and so on.
The hardest thing was getting The Chainsmokers to perform for the weekend, according to Wes.
Men are the unquestioned face of the pop music world right now.
Why it was so hard to get The Chainsmokers on the weekend and how Gunnar comments on the two artists canceling their shows, watch the video.
In reply to Ansipp, we have done a lot for Estonia's success.
In an interview with the Kronaika, European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip said he was saddened to see the daily politics of Estonia as the Juri Ratase government has upset the simple and predictable tax system.
The magazine Kronica took the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia's success and what I can be proud of.
I am happy that we have been a good team in the government and have made many important decisions in the months that have been counted, many of which have been awaited in Estonia for over a decade", Ratas wrote on social media today.
According to Ratase, these decisions include the income tax reform to increase people's incomes, the pension reform to ensure a decent retirement age for the elderly, the municipal reform to balance Estonian development, the increase in agricultural subsidies to improve rural life and, of course, the health reform to provide affordable and quality healthcare.
"Have a good vacation!" wrote the wheel, turning to Ansip.
Talent at the Queen's Weekend: A drunk man drove into a stranger's car to sleep
At 3:00 last night, the cops got a little bit of a self-defying challenge.
One Audi owner reported that a stranger had entered his car and fell asleep at the gas station near Port Arthur.
A patrolman responding to the incident found a man who was terrified when the guards arrived.
The man had been tired for a while on his journey and found a seat in the back seat of a stranger's car.
"A man was on his own after the guards woke him up", the Western Prefecture wrote on Facebook.
It's all right, all right!
You don't have to look far for a good outdoor cinema - from 7 to 12 August, the Tartu Film Festival takes place in the centre of Tartu, right on the square of the resort.
What makes it special is its focus on love movies.

Pula Film Festival in the Roman Amphitheatre, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, screaming crowds, a muddy arena - such a picture opened 2,000 years ago at the Pula Amphitheater in Croatia, where an international audience now enjoys a summer night of filming in July.
The first outdoor cinema was installed in a Roman-era building in 1953, making the Pula Film Festival one of the oldest outdoor cinemas in Europe.
Under the stars are Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley.
The price is symbolic: an evening in the Mediterranean with high-quality films means about three euros.
Sala Montjuïc free-air casino, Spain
Apart from the film, the Sala Montjuïc open-air cinema offers a wonderful view.
It is located above Barcelona on the high mountain of Montjuïc, or Mount of the Jews.
In the night sky of southern Europe, the view from the top of the fortress on a hill overlooks the whole of Barcelona's fire field, which is a sight in itself.
The organizers will be putting up a grand screening of the film from La La Land to 1979's Manhattan.
The cinema can accommodate up to 2,500 people at a time and the entrance fee is €6.50.
Tickets also include an outdoor concert just before the film, which is allowed to be enjoyed alongside your picnic basket.

Under the stars of cinema, Italy
The true nostalgic Italian spirit can be experienced in the central square of Bologna, where on summer nights the restored pearls of the local film archive are displayed.
The world's tenth largest church, the Basilica of San Petronio, is a popular place for 3,000 to 5,000 people to watch old movies.
Mainly 15th-century illuminated buildings in northern Italy, with summer's warmth and good company, create a romantic atmosphere in which every rugged northern dialect melts.
From June 19 to August 15, there's a new movie every night, and it's all free.
The Bologna Film Archive Festival under the stars.
Film Festival of the Place de la Vienne, Austria
Vienna is a mecca for the world of music, even in the movies: the Vienna Rathausplatz Film Festival, which takes place in the Austrian capital's main square, exclusively features concert recordings and music videos.
5,000 free seats will be filled every night from June 30 to September 3 as a special force.
In addition to the concerts of classical music stars - Placido Domingo and the Vienna Philharmonic - the festival features early morning jazz recordings.
What makes the film festival special in Vienna is the love of good food - in addition to world-class music, the best restaurants can be enjoyed.
Every day from 11 a.m. to midnight, a food and beverage shop is open, offering traditional Austrian flavors as well as delicious Asian, Greek, Italian, Mexican and Indian cuisines.
The stupidest questions you can ask a bartender.
The Huffington Post is a place where bartenders have been asked questions they'd rather not hear.
What's the best drink you can make?
True, some drinks contain more ingredients than others, but they require the same skill and fervor.
Often, bartenders interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fastest thing you have to do right now?" which gives them a signal that the customer has whatever he drinks, whether he prepares it for the bartender or not.
What drink do you like to make the most?
This question is interpreted in the same way as which cocktail would be the easiest to get at the bar today.
It's not the bartender's job to say that, but the client makes his own decisions based on the thickness of his wallet.
I'd rather wait for the bartenders to ask if there's any special offers at the moment.
What good is there?
Perhaps the question is a sincere desire to know if a bar is different from the others, but it could also be asked differently.
And the bartender can't even tell you what the client would prefer.
Can I have a drink that's not very sweet?
Here, as with the previous rule, the bartender is not familiar with your tastes and preferences, and what is sweet to one may not be sweet to others.
But he's willing to hear what flavors might be in the cocktail.
Does this drink cause me headache/nausea?
A bartender is not a doctor or a psychic to know how to give it to a client, hand in hand.
The cold summer has driven Estonians to travel abroad to the point that package travel is not only expensive but sold out regardless of the price.
It is not worthwhile to expect cheap airfare and last-minute tickets, but it is wise to consider travel plans for next year.
The man hostages a model with a plan to sell her off on the dark web.
A Polish citizen has taken a British model hostage in Italy.
The man was planning to auction a 20-year-old woman on the dark web, an encrypted Internet, the Guardian reported.
Police said the woman was lured to Milan on July 11th with a promise to get a job in a photo shoot.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
The prisoners allegedly tried to sell the woman for 230,000 pounds on the dark web and filed a ransom claim with her modeling agency.
On July 17, however, the woman's prisoner took her to the British consulate.
Police have confirmed that the suspect is a Polish national, Lukasz Herba, who lives in the UK.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Sera, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a young child and did not want to sell her as a sex slave.
Experiments like this are a bit of a drag on people.
It would be nice if we could just go ahead and think and draw conclusions.
The suggestion is obvious to those who want to be friends to spend a little more time researching their background.
But more generally, everyone should have a strategy for what they share about themselves on social media.
But at the state level, the question is whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats posed by social media.
The life span of the controlled-scale lizards ended with the summer school, but certainly not the life span of the perchers.
Sometimes you have to go to the woods for whatever reason.
But if the cold is between the skin, it's time to make a hot tea.
There's enough in the woods to do that.
Home Guard! is doing a little overhaul.
We talk about tea because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which is somewhat inflammatory, but not the best for our health.
When using plants found in the wild, you should always be prepared to experiment, as recipes and flavors vary.
Some plants do not need to be cooked for long, just boiling hot water. Others need to be pulled for hours.
Of course, care must also be taken to ensure that the water and plants are clean enough.
Much also depends on the season and location of harvesting.
Let us now take a closer look at how to make some simple tea and how they can affect us.

The men's bottle can be drunk quietly all year round.
If it is good to drink less than two liters of water a day, it is a good way to meet the demand for vitamin C and to provide some extra energy for the grocery store.
As with all plants, the benefits of pine can be obtained by using alternative methods, such as crushing - branches do not need to be boiled for long, only hot water is needed and they can be pulled for a few hours.
Half a liter of water takes 0.4 liters of branches to boil for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing about 25 mg of vitamin C, plenty of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 cups of sugar, or about 20 kcal of sugar.
Lemons and honey can always be added to the dish to improve the flavor.
And if the drink gets a little bit bitter, you can dilute it with water like syrup.
The same way you make a six-course course, but the drink itself tastes a little different.
The risky drink is excellent and helps with a wide range of problems, from rheumatism to acne.
It is a powerful fatigue-relieving agent, painkiller, and cough-reliever as well as a fever-reducing agent in cold cases.
Consequently, it would not be worth drinking more than half a liter a day.
The drink also tends to sweat, so in winter, it should be a quiet time to enjoy it.
In winter, take fresh garlic to make the drink, and in summer, use leaves, herbs, or berries.
A half-liter of a drink requires a small, barrel-length ox to boil until the water turns red.
The danger zone can also be used for pulling.
To do this, break the rods and keep them in warm water for a couple of hours.
A longer and more thorough treatment will also make the drink harder.
The finished grapefruit can also be added to the pineapple flavor.

Blackberry is a tree that in nature looks like a black burnt piece on the side of a tree.
It's mostly on helmets, but it's also found elsewhere.
The use of mushrooms is very broad - as a hot drink, as a fireplace, as a substitute for viruses, etc.
You can wash yourself very well with a towel.
Black pepper is a kind of super drink that can be used to treat a wide range of diseases, even cancer, to ease or reduce stress, to increase life expectancy.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and a lot of B vitamins as well as antioxidants and a little bit of minerals and protein.
Tea made from mushrooms can be drunk every day, there is no risk of overuse.
To make the drink, about 3 x 3 cm of mushroom should be boiled in 2-3 liters of water for 5 to 15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited the fourth largest island of Estonia, Vorms, on a small island tour, where he met with local island officials and residents to discuss current issues of island life.
The circuit of the island of Formsa started at Sviby harbour, where Prime Minister Ratas was greeted by the Vorms's only son-in-law Tanel Viks and the chairman of the board Ivo Sarapuu.
The first was the historic St. Olaf Church and the remarkable stonework, unique in Estonia for its cobblestone and sandstone rings.
The first meeting was held at the Forms Primary School, where Director Age Hälvin spoke to the Prime Minister about the school's lifestyle and curriculum, which includes distance learning.
The Prime Minister has also visited the new and modern Operational Service Community Building, which opened in 2015, and also hosted a meeting with the island's government.
The discussion covered important issues for residents, such as the development of shipping and air links between the small islands and the mainland.
The State has committed itself to ensuring regular transport links on small permanent islands, but increasing traffic during the summer period, for example, also makes important journeys for locals more difficult.
These are places where the country can take local needs and wishes into account early on and in the planning process", the Prime Minister said.
In addition, the construction of small ports, education of interest, island safety and rescue capacity were discussed.
Today's visit to Formsa was the last part of the Prime Minister's visit to the small islands, to explore the island's environment and to discuss issues with local residents and local authorities.
In July, the head of government visited the Saarland, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Viland Islands and Manila, and during August he visited Naissaart, Prangli and Aegnat.
For the first time, the Centre Party is going to the polls to challenge the party's founder and ideological cornerstone.
So far, we've said "Central Division" and we've thought Savior or vice versa.
Now we have to find a way to get him out of the middle court.
They must also blur the party's colour, sometimes a criminal and embarrassing past, between the expectations of Savisaare's party supporters and the electorate.
The departure of Savior puts the Centre in the most complicated position on the ideological plane.
From past political practices and ideology, it can be said that this is a certain way of playing the old nose.
Several cards that used to be trumpets may not be realized this time.
The populism card doesn't work for the Centre Party because Savisaar can always promise more than the Prime Minister's party.
The Russian card game is complicated by the position of the Centre Party in the government and by the fact that we see the so-called Savinova election union pushing the gas north.
The victim's card is already in Savisaare's pocket because of the ongoing trial.
For the middle class, the map of the indigent people of the people and the poor is missing.
The first is that it's worthless to create, and the second is that coalition partners in government are preventing it from playing harder.
But one card can be even heavier.
All the recent elections have confirmed that the parties that can formulate the main conflict in the election and then implement it will be successful.
The main conflict has always been around Savisaire.
If a party should come up with an idea to invade a well-functioning opposition, there's another trumpet missing from the Central Party card pack.
What about the Central Division?
They still have a strong party machine and considerable resources.
There's plenty of tape before the election.
Four years ago, the taxpayer's self-promotion of the disgrace and the money has hopefully been paid back to the Tallinns.
The city media are still there, but the cultivation of partisan guerrilla literature has declined there as well.
Besides, the party has voice magnets.
Their role will be to get the chestnuts out of the fire, because the image of the ruling party is not enough to motivate voters.
In an ideological sense, the Jury Wheel must find its way, because the journey of savisaar ended this week.
Three U.S. Marines were lost in a plane crash in Australian waters.
The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have ended their search operation, the Naval Base Camp Butler in Japan said in a statement, basically confirming that the military has no hope of finding the missing alive.
The accident occurred with a Navy aircraft, the Osprey MV-22, which was launched aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board, 23 of whom were able to be found and rescued.
A plane that crashed into the sea last month was taking part in a joint US-Australian training exercise in the state of Queensland, in Shoalwater Bay.
Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said Saturday's incident took place near the shore of Shoalwater Bay.
A woman found a stranger's wedding ring in a washing machine. Who could it belong to?
"I started to take the washing machine out when a glow between the washing machine's cucumber pinks ripped my eye", says the woman, who found a stranger's wedding ring in her washing machine.
In fact, Karin did not pay attention to the flash of light at the door of the washing machine in the first round.
I got the machine back on.
"This dirty laundry is coming right away next to two little children", the woman says.
And when I did the second wash and started taking the laundry out, there was this damn thing between the washing machine's cucumber and I found this ring.
The gold wedding ring carves the name of a man who married 14 years ago, Tom.
Since no one in the family knows a man or woman by that name who might be married to some Tom, the ring is a complete myth.
Karin examined the older child's hand to see if she had found a ring in his pocket and put it in his pocket, and the ring had gone through the washing machine, but the child confirmed that she had not brought the ring home.
Karin and her partner have lived in a flat on Madala Street in Tallinn for a year.
They rented it out before, and since then, the washing machine has been there.
But if the ring is supposed to be connected to the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
"Now I'm uncomfortable and can't figure out which way the ring had to land in the washing machine", laughed the woman.
Because the pace of life apart from two little children is fast enough, I forgot to find my first home on the drawer.
"Last time there were posts looking for the owner of a wedding ring, and now it seemed like the time was right to look for the owner of the one you found", Karin recalls on social media, referring to the case where a wedding ring found on Puhangu Street in Tallinn last week found its owner happily.
"Because Facebook is a place where people find and search for things, I thought I'd try my luck there first", says Karin, whose post has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"The post has received all kinds of feedback and not everything is good", says the wife, noting that her first comments suggested that she take her husband on the list.
I felt like I needed this shit right now.
That my husband has become the biggest cheat I've ever heard of.
To be honest, it made me nervous at first, but later, when comments came that I might have been screwing with the ring owner, it started to laugh.
The commentators also suggested that the ring may have reached the woman's second round in her pocket.
"Well, the last time I saw a pair of second-round pants bought for work was six months ago, and they flew into the washing machine without further investigation, but did they?" she wonders.
Okay, well, my partner and I agreed that now, on principle, we need to find the ring owner.
Whatever the reason for the ring's disappearance.
Divorce, family break-up or whatever.
I think it's the only thing I can do, because if I ever lose my wedding ring, I know I'd be very grateful to someone who would try to find me and return valuable property.
Karin has also turned to the Family Office for help finding the owner.
I was told that on this date in Estonia, a man by that name was never married.
One ring has found its owner.
A wedding ring found in Tallinn's Pelgurannas on July 21 recently returned to its owner, whose engraving suggested that it belonged to an elderly woman.
"I was walking with my dog this morning and noticed a gold ring behind the house of Puga 53 in the enclosed lane", says Gerli, "which allowed the engraving to suggest that it belonged to an elderly woman".
Gerli posted the photo of the ring (pictured) on her Facebook page and in the "Marked in Tallinn" group, shared the information with the North Tallinn city and Northern Prefecture.
Two weeks later, Geral was contacted by the police and told that the ring owner had been identified.
"I got in touch with the owner's daughter and on Monday night, the ring was found in her possession". The ring was missing because the grandmother had injured her hand and put the other finger on the ring, but it had slipped off.
"She lost it the same morning I was walking my dog", says Gerli.
While the media's focus has been on Pärnu and its Weekend, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
The Inksikurmu festival in the southern part of the country also has loyal fans.
One of them, for example, wrote on Twitter: "I sold my weekend ticket so I could go to the Inkside".
And why not?
In addition to local artists, performers from the United States, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England, and elsewhere will also perform there.
The festival in the magical forest surprises the performers because of its charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, couldn't have tweeted this morning to wonder how beautiful Estonia is.
But visitors have not been a bit of a goat in sharing the great adventures.
To get a taste of the magic of the Inchkrum Festival, see the galleries!
Estonia U18 team recognised the UK's advantage in the semi-final and will not qualify for Division A
The match started at an extremely fast pace and in the first quarter, the British won by five points (18:23), a lot of balls were thrown.
In the second quarter, the gap grew further and the visitors went on a nine-point break (31:40).
Estonia managed to win the third quarter, but only by one point.
The Estonians' loss before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
In the fourth quarter, Estonia completely broke down and finally had to accept the loss with 61:75.
The loss shattered Estonian hopes of reaching Division A, because only the two best teams can get there.
In the third place game tomorrow, Estonia will face the loser of the Croatian-Israeli game.

Europol is hunting down the nightclub stabber in Tallinn.
Russian national Ernest Gammer, who stabbed a stranger at a Tallinn nightclub in 2010 and caused him serious health damage, has been named to Europe's most wanted list.
Australia's species at the crossroads
Professional sports are at a crossroads in Australia: some areas have moved so far by corporate means that they are too commercial to be classified as sports;
Others are returning to the amateur world, which is too sporty to be considered a business.
This confusion is evidenced by Cricket Australia (CA)'s painful delays in reaching a player salary agreement, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU)'s indecision in dismissing the team, the rise of the Australian Football Federation (FFA) stakeholders, the difficulties of the rugby union in the functioning of an independent commission and the Australian Football League (AFL)'s relentless efforts to be a banner of social justice among the people.
Investment banker and Australian Sports Commission President John Wylie has been actively trying to lead the Olympic Games along the same path as professional sports, placing businessmen with no elite experience in the sport in senior positions.
The mining giant Rio Tinto, which has a reputation for using tactics to capture trade unions, was seen as a pillar of CA's problems in reaching an agreement with the Australian Cricket Association (ACA).
The Chairman of CA, David Peever, is a former CEO of Rio Tinto Australia and he hired CA to assist the CEO and advisor of Rio Tinto in hiring negotiations.
It would be wrong to think that elite men whose approach to cricket is unforgiving do not like the sport.
For example, Peever was a regular at Storm's home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, the tough negotiations between CA and ACA and the extremely high wages have left the impression that Australia's favorite summer cats now belong more to business than to sport.
On the contrary, the failure of the unskilled leader of the ARU, former NAB CEO Cameron Clyne, to pull the Australian Super Rugby team out has pushed too far back to its roots.
Rugby union people now prefer to go to the suburban stadium to watch the game between amateur teams while drinking beer and eating hot dogs.
Rugby League boasts that they have the most qualified and diverse corporate management in Australia, but too many failures to meet the demands of international partners indicate that it is still too much of a sport to be a business.
Both rugby and football have management issues because the stakeholders demand more power.
Both of the overseers, John Grant of ARLC and Steven Lowy of FFA, have shown that their business activities have not been enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, the former Kangaroo, ran a successful IT company, but was completely out of the game for 20 years.
It was valued when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
The overwhelmingly untrustworthy stakeholders decided that no one who had participated in the last three years in any way in the game of rugby could participate in the Commission's work except as a passive fan.
But Pendel went too far into the commercial side, and fans have been looking for a savior ever since - someone with a name-calling past in the sport.
Lowy, Westfield's chief foreign investment officer, took over the FFA chair from his father Frank, one of Australia's richest men.
League A clubs want to be better represented in the Congress electing the board.
Their owners are losing money, but they think they're as valuable as Manchester United.
Ironically, the sports and business ethics wing of FIFA is sending out ambassadors to end the sport's civil war.
The AFL has its own affiliation with Rio Tinto through its recently-deceased chairman Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL commissioner Chris Lynch, the mining giant's chief financial officer.
The association is proud to be a national leader in promoting gender equality, indigenous and refugee activities and gay rights.
Some clerics might suggest that this is done by hiding government aid funds.
When Fitzpatrick was inaugurated, AFL president Richard Goyder said: "The AFL is more than a business, considering how it benefits all of these communities".
Goyder is the soon-to-be-retired CEO of Wes Farmers and the first AFL president not to play at the elite level.
Bob Every, former president of Wesfarmers, is on the board of Cricket Australia.
The main line of appointment of members of the professional sports board is often to place independence above competence.
In the wake of recruiting businessmen, they've forgotten something that could be called a crush on and passion for sports.
Furthermore, many corporate heavyweights are not used to the media-intensive and sometimes personal-level critical surveillance.
Something that works in the corporate world may not translate into sports.
Flynn submitted an amended disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump's national security adviser, presented a revised federal financial disclosure report on Thursday, which includes new details about Flynn's deals with Trump's transition to the presidency, the Iranian-American businessman-related company and the data law firm's parent company that worked on the Trump campaign.
In a letter providing corrected information, Flynn noted that his initial disclosure reports were submitted in an expedited manner without the usual consultation and oversight of White House lawyers and the Government Ethics Office.
According to the letter, Flynn was not given the attention that others were given because he was no longer a White House employee at the time.
Flynn resigned from office just 24 days after taking office amid rumours that he had given Vice President Pence misleading information about his post-election contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Flynn also faced criticism for external payments made to him while working in the private sector following his resignation as Director of the Defence Agency in 2014.
In the information previously released to the investigators of the Office of the Representative, Flynn stated that he received fees and charges of approximately US$68,000 from Russian-related entities in 2015.
In addition to the Russian-related revenue, information provided on Thursday revealed that Flynn has received at least $5,000 for consulting on a Middle East nuclear power plant project.
Flynn's work on the project was previously disclosed, but he was not known to have been paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with SCL Group, then the British parent company of Cambridge Analytica, a data science firm hired by Donald Trump's campaign.
One of Cambridge's major funders is venture capital mogul Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential conservative financial backer.
The Washington Post reported in February that Flynn was hired as an advisor to SCL Group.
According to those familiar with his role, Flynn's aim was to help SCL's American subsidiary win new contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired a former Flynn colleague from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to lead the procurement efforts.
Flynn claimed that the person with knowledge of his activities did not receive any compensation from SCL and did not actually do any work.
It was revealed that Flynn received about $28,000 in connection with Trump's transition to the presidency.
The largest source of public income is $140,000 for Flynn's work as an advisor and consultant to Minneapolis-based NJK Holding Corp., which is run by Nasser Kazeminy, an Iranian-born businessman currently living in the United States.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday evening in a statement by NJK that 'Flynn advises NJK Holdings on the interest of investing in the company's securities'.
NJK is financing technology company GreenZone Systems, which is chaired by Flynn.
GreenZone is led by Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner at Flynn Intel, a company currently under investigation for its role in lobbying on behalf of a company operating in the Netherlands that is linked to the Turkish government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the Democratic leader on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked Kian to provide information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and travels.
During Flynn's previous security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had multiple foreign business contacts.
But Cummings said Flynn didn't tell the same investigators about the contact.
According to a person familiar with the situation, Flynn nevertheless passed a security check at the time.
The August Blues brought the lead singer back to life on stage, the singer was taken to Tallinn by ambulance
Ivan got to play the rest of the set when he got hit by a health bug.
An ambulance was called in and massaged his heart for tens of minutes", says the organizer Indrek Ditmann.
"The show was delayed, but the festival continues", he says, adding: "The audience has been informed, of course they also saw everything that happened on stage".
Ivan is on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope for the best", says Ditmann in conclusion.
An eyewitness told Western Life that a health hazard hit Denisenko during the performance.
First, the man stopped singing, then the game started to go by and the man fell down the stairs.
Jan Nieuwfeld, a conference speaker, came to the stage and asked if there was a doctor in the audience.
A little later, he asked me to pray for Denisenko.
The following is the list of the official languages of the European Union:
Ivan Denisenko, also known as Ivan Blues, is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural activist.
Ivan's musical career began in parallel with art studies at the National Academy of Arts and Architecture of Ukraine.
In college, he was immediately inspired by his incredibly deep bass and was invited to sing the nationally renowned folk song Golden Gate.
In the choir, he befriended people who introduced him to the blues and later became his bandmates.
The first concert of the band Ivan Blues & Friends took place on December 31, 2007 at the Kiev bar called Rag-Time.
Since then, the band has performed regularly in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes book in Tagalog
"A Helping Hand" is the first book by Michael, a former BBC editor and mother of two, who has previously written for the Singapore Tatler magazine.
It took three years to complete and is dedicated to his Filipino assistants, Maricon Espiritu and Ginalyn Narag, who help with cooking and caring for their son, Joseph, four years old, and daughter, Florence, eight years old.
His assistants, whom he describes as "family members", helped test recipes during the writing of the book, the first book of its kind in Singapore to be published in both English and Tagalog.
A Helping Hand is available in bookstores throughout Singapore for SGD 39,90 and also in excursion centres abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he got a cold from a colleague.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophen to reduce his fever.
The rest of the day, he was questioned, tortured, mourned, and examined.
None of the tests showed anything, but you didn't want to send her home either.
He understood the reason.
For the past two years, he had been taking a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjögren's syndrome.
The drug reduces the immune system's ability to fight infections.
Sjögren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body's own white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it were an invading organism that in this case caused chaos in both the tear-and-spitting cells and some joints.
Weekly ether-septis injections had helped to reduce her joint pain.
But he knew that the drug would render him quite helpless in the event of a serious infection.
When acetaminophen started working, the patient felt much better.
The trauma team decided to put her in the hospital for the night.
If it's the virus, as the doctors suspected, he'll be fine the next day and sent home.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he took a course of infections that people who take etanercept are susceptible to.
That was a long list.
Viruses cannot be treated before diagnosis, so he focused on bacterial infections.
One of the bacteria that attacks people with immune deficiencies is the foodborne listeria.
It is often found in unpasteurized milk and cheese, and it causes terrible nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that he never experienced.
Legionnaire' s disease is another infection that is common among people taking this medicine but has not experienced coughing or shortness of breath.
The more common bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, can cause joint infections, but again, it had no joint complaints.
Still, the doctor planned to start a comprehensive antibiotic treatment that would cover all these risks.
But when the patient was there, it didn't seem like he could be bothered by a serious infection.
The trauma center doctors hadn't given him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to stretch out with antibiotics and simply observe and wait, but if the patient had one of the infections he had read about, even a few hours of delay in treatment could have resulted in death.
The situation was further complicated by the fact that the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
It's been a risk-benefit relationship.
With typically low stakes, the decision to start antibiotic use or not is changed when the consequences can be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, another resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague he was planning an antibiotic, he just asked to review the patient and make his recommendation.
Your colleague met with a patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, he would be virtually immune to infection.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since the patient has a penicillin allergy, Girard should have him tested to see if he can tolerate a drug that is not penicillin but a close relative of it.
Girard asked me to take a test dose.
If he had a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have had a rash or lowered his blood pressure.
Nothing happened.
That's why he was given a full dose.
A few hours later, Girard got a call.
The patient's body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
He rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face was glowing with a thin, sweaty patch and her cheeks were pink.
Although she seemed uncomfortable, her heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked the patient for the good fortune he had given the patient antibiotics.
He asked for another dose of Tylenol, and when he came to check on his patient one last time, he fell asleep.
The fuel was receding.
The red rubber and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for the night shift, he first visited the patient.
He had also taken in five other patients, but this patient was Girard's most concern at home after his daytime shift.
In the hours he hadn't seen her, her larval organism had grown in the lab.
It was too early to tell what it was.
What was clear, though, was that it was a bacterium strong enough to grow quickly, and that it was not Staphylococcus aureus or Legionnaires' disease.
The list of other options was long, and none of them seemed really appropriate.
It took two more days before they finally could identify the bacteria.
It was a list-threatening bacterium.
Girard, like everyone else who took care of the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you get pictures of illnesses in your head.
Girard had listeriosis, a disease caused by unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
He further researched the material on this unusual infection and found that although people with normal immune systems may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly like a fellow patient.
However, in pregnant women, people over 65 years of age and those with compromised immune systems, infection can spread outside the digestive tract - sometimes without the usual symptoms - and into the bloodstream.
From there, it can spread throughout the body like a fire.
This type of infection, called invasive listeriosis, can result in up to 30% death in patients who suffer from it.
Indeed, although not as prevalent as botulism, listeriosis can be just as deadly.
An early dose of antibiotics can save lives.
If it's a foodborne disease, what food carries the bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague did not consume unpasteurized milk or soft cheeses on the trip, an Internet search in Scotland this summer identified a listener's outbreak linked to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they did eat a little smoked crack.
The exact location of the bacteria was kept a secret.
Once the team of doctors found out what was wrong with the patient, they were able to adapt the antibiotics.
Her three-week treatment ended in July.
Doctors advised him to stay calm until the end of the summer, but he is now feeling quite well and is back at the museum and at his beloved job.
He was praised for preventing a global cyberattack.
And then he was arrested.
When the Kronos malware was first advertised in 2014 on Russian floorboards, the asking price of $7,000 suggested that selling the malware was a profitable venture.
Kronost was advertised as a hacking service that can obtain data, including usernames and passwords, ATM PINs and personal information that is useful for solving security issues.
Motherboard announced Thursday that Hutchins was being held at Las Vegas Airport after a week-long visit to the Black Hat and Defcon security conferences.
He was planning to fly back home to Britain.
The security community responded to the arrest of their valued star with astonishment and skepticism.
Some warned that the claims against Hutchins could damage the relationship between white-collar hackers - researchers who seek software weaknesses to identify and solve problems, not to commit crimes or cause havoc - and law enforcement.
Others were hesitant that Hutchins could create such software for an attack.
In July 2014, he tweeted that no one had a copy of Kronos, which is a seemingly strange request when he himself was the author of the malware.
While the exact details of the connection to the Hutchins Kronos are unclear, security researchers have often ignored legal issues in searching for vulnerable sites in computer code.
In recent years, large tech companies have put forth 'error money' to formalize the process of reporting problems and compensating for their work for investigators.
Defcon, which brings together unrestricted security experts from around the world, has also had a strained relationship with law enforcement.
In 2002, for example, the FBI arrested a Russian crypto-assistant in a Las Vegas hotel room after he released software that authorities said could compromise the security of certain types of e-books.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil rights organization, said in a statement that it was concerned about Hutchins' arrest and was investigating the matter further.
WannaCry malware infected computers running the older versions of Microsoft Windows.
After spreading the software encrypted computers and locked users' files, crates and chains.
If the infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network could become infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins was a hero by accident.
In an interview with The Guardian in May, Hutchins said he registered a web domain after discovering that malicious software was trying to connect to it.
By registering for a domain for $10.69, he started what he called a kill loop, which stopped the software from spreading.
His initial intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a cybersecurity researcher at Los Angeles-based firm Kryptos Logic, said in an interview that he didn't go to college and learned to write software himself.
The company has not commented.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous by communicating with the media through his malware tech account, but the British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was praised by the cybersecurity community for his achievements and was awarded a Special Recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry event.
The Senate has confirmed Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, as ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Johnson was Trump's biggest financial supporter during his presidential campaign and was named finance director of his inauguration committee in November.
Johnson, a longtime Republican donor, also helped raise money for George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
He previously served as Jeb Bush's finance director during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson's grandfather founded the medical device company Johnson & Johnson.
Previously, the United States ambassador to Great Britain was Matthew Barzun.
Barzani was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned in January this year before Trump was sworn into office.
Belgian authorities already knew about the contamination of eggs in June.
"We were aware of the potential problems with the insecticide fipronion at the beginning of June", said Katrien Stragier, spokeswoman for the Belgian Food Safety Authority, on VRT.
We immediately launched an investigation and talked to the DA's office about the matter because it could have been fraud.
From there, the investigation became classified.
We understand that people have healthcare-related questions and we try to answer them", added Stagier.
The AFP news agency has been trying to get information from the prosecutor dealing with the case in recent days, but he didn't say anything because the investigative judge forbade the publication of the information.
The chickens have been withdrawn from sale in Belgium as a precautionary measure pending the results of the analyses.
Millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from sale in the Netherlands and Germany.
The German Minister for Agriculture, Christian Schmidt, has called on the Dutch and Belgian authorities to clarify the matter quickly.
"It is clear that someone has contaminated eggs with prohibited products in a criminal manner", Schmidt told the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Authority (VTA), eggs produced in the Netherlands are unlikely to be contaminated with pesticides in Estonia.
"We have no Dutch eggs in Estonia", VTA spokesman Martin Altraja told BNS.
It added that there were no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia either.
According to the Office for Statistics, no eggs have been imported from Estonia to the Netherlands in the last 10 years.
The last egg was imported from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fiproni was introduced into the sewers as a result of the Dutch company Chickfriend's attempt to treat pregnant chickens.
The Dutch and Belgian media have reported that the pesticide ingredient was delivered to Chickfriend through the Belgian company, but this has not yet been confirmed.
In higher doses, according to the World Health Organization, fipronil is moderately dangerous and may adversely affect humans, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid.
Is there a solution to avoiding boring robot messages?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in Buffalo, New York, relies on customers calling and ordering cannabidiol, pizza and potato chips.
But most of the time, it's automatic messages that try to suppress fraud.
"It's getting to the point where it's not going to let other callers get to us", said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help's on the way, but slowly.
Over the past year, new tools have been added to mobile phones at the urging of the government to prevent unwanted "robot messages".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing phone companies to block more junk calls and hopes to kick off fraud with high fines.
Experts say that these steps are not the final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and state non-calling lists should protect people from unwanted calls from remote vendors.
But traitors don't care if they break the law.
Cheats reach people cheaply and easily by using "automatic pickups" that automatically make multiple calls at once.
It's estimated that Americans get tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Of course, not all of them are deceitful.
For example, pharmacies send automated messages about prescription compliance.
But too often, the situation is this: you owe the IRS money; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; they offer a free cruise!
In addition, garbage disposal services use sophisticated technology that shows a local or important number, such as a tax office, as a caller on the phone.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission's decision to initiate the investigation was not in line with the requirements of the FCCC.
Telephone companies and independent applications are able to scan or block unwanted calls by comparing them to known problematic number databases and analyzing suspicious behavior, such as a number that calls many people on non-calling lists.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the calculation of the costs of the aid.
Verizon and Sprint can order them for an additional fee.
Some Android phones, including Google's Pixel, are free to play junk talk.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas, 39, of Orlando, Florida, said that her AT&T app detects and blocks certain fraudulent calls on her mobile phone, but that she has given up on phone lines.
"I very rarely answer calls from numbers I don't know", Vargas said.
Apps like YouMail and Nomorobo offer free but limited reliefs for home phones.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow 'conditional call forwarding' to forward calls if the line is not answered or is busy.
Nomorobo is not available to all home telephone service providers and does not operate with parent, vapour-based telephone lines.
You can also buy some of the weeds, some of them quite raw, that block calls on home phones.
Verizon is also testing the display of suspicious calls on the home phone number.
Phone companies are already able to block certain calls that are deceptive.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalize such practices and allow for the blocking of other suspected fraud calls.
That means Verizon can block a toll-free number that takes calls for a fee, but never initiates one itself.
Operators would also be able to block calls where they know they are not legal, such as 911 routing numbers.
These rules need to be finalised.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy aspirant at the nonprofit Consumer Union, said these developments were "hopeful" but did not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
First, non-calling lists are not applicable to certain types of callers, like debt collectors and political campaigns.
And, uh, Mahoney says the FCC rules would only cover fake numbers.
Not all robot speech is meant to be a joke.
The Consumers' Union wants telephone companies to make call blocking tools available to all consumers free of charge.
In the long run, the FCC supports industry efforts to confirm that the caller is really who he claims to be.
Maybe one day, you can see a green bird on a smartphone screen if the caller is right-handed.
U.S. Telecom, a lobbying group for telephone companies, says it could take years to implement, but it would be a powerful tool against robotic operators.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop the annoying call tracking of consumers switching numbers.
If you register for the current non-call list but later get a new number, the vendor may not know and may start to get into trouble on the new line.
"Roboters aren't going anywhere", said Aaron Foss of Nomorobost, a cellphone and home phone call-blocking service.
"They're criminals, and they're finding a new way to get around any system.
But our job is to make it as difficult for them as possible".
There are a number of logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Yeah, unfortunately, that's not practical for corporate phone lines like Sports City.
Cut off any unsolicited calls.
Don't speak up or press a button.
If you communicate with them, they can spot you in any response and bury you under more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use the call blocking apps.
If you have privacy concerns, check the app's rules to see if it shares your call or contact information with vendors.
Do not provide callers with personal information such as bank account or social security number.
Rasmus Mountain: The preparations haven't gone exactly as I saw in my mind.
"It's not exactly what I saw in my mind", said Mount of the World Cup.
Friday and Saturday are important moments that show the exact shape of the body.
And the competition shows what we've been analyzing here anyway.
Today, I believe that my training has been of high quality both this year and in previous years, so that, above all, it is possible to run normally.
Nothing special about the start of the preliminary race at 13.05 EST on Sunday.
In the last few weeks, there's been a lot of exercise overload.
I should have fresh, and it might be very helpful that the last week before the M.I. was a little easier.
Physically, the days before the start are like this: yesterday the obstacle-runner was resting, today he's doing a warm-up workout.
But he does not want to blame himself too much on his spiritual preparation: "I guess I have developed my own routines over time.
There's a lot of quiet and peace and I'm not gonna put any rock music in my ears.
I don't need to watch any motivational videos or read self-help books, but to be here and at this moment, to appreciate the opportunity that athletes from all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
That's what makes it special.
The World Championships are, of course, the highlight of the year for every lightweight, and the Mountain has taken every previous start, including the Champions League, as a test - tried some technical nuance, compared itself to some competitor.
There's no more chance of experimenting with the title contests.
"The goal is to run fast", says Mount, but adds that if you can save a percentage or a few in the run-up and potentially the semi-final, you will definitely benefit from it in the next run.
The Finns gave their men a dance party.
When the first men's dance party was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organizers probably never dreamed that the northern neighbors would be emulating a small Estonian town.
Today, however, the first Finnish men's dance party is being held in Lappeenranta, in Western Finland.
"The representatives of the city of Lapua were so enthusiastic about the last men's dance party in the friendly city of Rakvere that they wanted to organize something similar themselves", said Rakvere's deputy mayor, Kairit Pihlak.
"This is what is happening today at Lapua Baseball Stadium in Finland as part of the 100th celebration of Mies-Tanssipidot in Finland, with 100 men from Viruma present", Pihlak said.
According to Pihlaku, this is a great example of the good cooperation between two friendly cities.
It also marks the anniversaries of the Republics of Estonia and Finland.
Among the hundred dancers is the pre-season winner of Rocket 69, Karl Reinkubja.
"I am honoured to be one of the 100 men who, by participating in Finland, show what Viru men are capable of", he said.
"The men who dance in the blood of Rakvere have set up their work to show proper respect for their northern neighbors in preparation for the Finnish men's dance party", commented Ain Suurkaev, a member of the Rakvere municipality.
The performance of the Viruma men was completed by the dance ensemble Tarvanpää's artistic director Tiiu Myrk together with the famous choir director Elo Üleoja.
Estonian choreography is based on Estonian choral music.
The first Estonian men's dance party was held in 2006, and the last one was held in Rakvere in 2015.
Waiting for the final of the night's chase: Will Gerd Kanter make history at MMI?
The current World Cup is the eighth for Canter, and none of its competitors in London have achieved this.
In addition, Kanter is the only pitcher in history to have won a complete set of medals (gold, two silvers and two bronzes) at the World Championships.
As of 5 August 2017, Kanter is 38 years and 92 days old.
If an Estonian throws himself into the World Cup twice, he will become the oldest pitcher to win a gold medal at the World Championships.
A similar possibility exists with Polish mobster Pjotr Malachowsk (34 years and 60 days old).
Other exciting facts:
Only athletes from two countries have won the world championship in the two disciplines more than once.
Germany has nine gold medals, Lithuania two.
The World Championship record is held by Virgilijus Alekna, who was crowned 70.17 in Helsinki (2005).
The lowest score ever achieved in the title is 66.20 - achieved in Riedel (1991).
Research shows that the seeds are also spread by the larvae
Like birds and mammals, the buds spread seeds.
These insects are known primarily as decomposers, helping to break down solids under the forest.
But Prussians also help to spread the seeds.
Japanese scientists have discovered that the pruss cat is an important factor in the propagation of seeds to the wild monotropastrum lobster.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophyll and therefore is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species derives its nutrients from mushrooms growing underground.
The plant spreads small, odorless, brownish white fruits into the forest.
Fruits have very little or no flavor, and Japanese researchers found that birds and mammals are not interested in them as a food source.
Only a handful of vertebrates consumed fruit flesh, and the wild boar Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the fruit.
Researchers checked the pollen's emissions to see if these insects helped spread the seeds.
The researchers found that for every fecal tube expelled after eating the fruit, there were an average of three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the seeds seeded were viable.
Scientists believe that this unique plant species has likely learned to use its ability to propagate the seeds of sprouts in evolution.
The seeds of the plant hang near the ground and are ready as the buds emerge from their hatching stage.
The researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"Given that some 4,600 species of pruss have been identified so far, the distribution of seeds through pruss can be a much wider and undocumented mechanism, not just a certain species' unique ability to exploit pruss", said Naoto Sugiura, associate professor at Kumamoto University, in a press release.
"The disclosures are expected to encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and sprouts and to further explore the ways in which sprouts spread seeds".
The Duchess of Cambridge's childhood friend should have had the "right to die"
The Duchess of Cambridge's childhood friend, suffering from a terminal illness, should have been allowed to end her life, her mother said.
Isobel Kennerley, a member of the Duchess's Guild, pleaded after a three-year battle with a brain tumor that caused her "extreme pain, suffering and loss of dignity" to be allowed to die.
A 34-year-old woman with cerebral palsy in children was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, but she suffered terribly before she died at the end of May, according to her mother.
Christine Eeley, 65, of Newbury, Berks, has called for a change in the law that would allow terminally ill and mentally competent people to "control the manner and timing of their deaths".
He said that her tortured death caused him "a real trauma", and he wished that the law had allowed him to put in place a plan that would have allowed his daughter to die with dignity if her condition had worsened.
Chinese Internet sensors play a complicated game of cat and mouse
According to experts, a shift that could affect a wide range of users from researchers to companies indicates that China is increasingly concerned about the impact of the Internet.
"It seems that restrictions are getting more and more intense, but at the same time the Internet is more powerful than ever", said Emily Parker, author of "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are", which examines the influence of the Internet in China, Cuba, and Russia.
Beijing's restrictions on the Internet are comparable to the power of the Internet in China.
Experts claim that China's control has not yet been maximized and in many cases the game of cat and mouse continues.
One day after Apple launched last week, people started spreading on Chinese social media a way to access these tools that are so simple that even a tech stranger can do it.
This included registering a human app store in another country where VPN applications are still available.
Still, Thursday's test shows China wants to turn the game into a cat's favor.
Several Chinese internet service providers said on Thursday on their social media accounts, websites or emails that Chinese security officials are testing a new way to find the internet addresses of their services that host or use illegal content.
If they are found, the authorities ask, according to these companies, that internet service providers require their customers to cease such activities.
If customers continue, service providers and Chinese officials will interrupt their connection minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request to comment on the matter.
Studies show that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPNs and other types of software to get through the Great Wall of Fire.
While foreign television and pornography bans keep many people away, they pose little challenge to China's vast online community.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for new Internet controls over the years, but he has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors in China's future economic development.
As cyberspace has become a central part of what is happening across China, government controls have evolved.
It is difficult to explain the extent of the new efforts, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly for fear of being caught up in the Chinese government's disregard.
However, some frequent users have said that bypassing restrictions is becoming increasingly difficult.
One student who is studying in the United States and returning to China for his summer vacation said that his local VPN is blocked.
He said he took this period away from social media as a kind of meditation and left a message on Facebook to his friends explaining why he was feeling so down to earth.
A PhD student at an environmental engineering university in China said that without Google, research has become more difficult, even though the university has found alternative printing that students wouldn't always need the Internet.
He claims to have found a new way to get past the Great Firewall without revealing what he's dealing with.
According to Chinese Internet observers, some VPNs are still operating and China could take much more steps to step up restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do this, it would have stopped VPN use much more by now", said VPNDada, a spokesperson for a website set up in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs that work.
"If the government had sent out more cats, it would have been much more difficult for the mice", said a spokesman who declined to name himself in China because of the group's work.
"They probably didn't do it because they have to leave a little breathing space for people or businesses".
China's online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current atmosphere is partly due to the upcoming important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, the 19th Party Congress, to be held this fall.
Five years ago, before this encounter, VPNs were hit by unforeseen outages at the time.
Like economic policy or foreign policy, censorship in China is part of a complex and often lacking political process.
Analysts say government ministries feel pressure to show before the party congress that they are effective and able to intervene in case of a problem.
"This is certainly not the apocalypse of VPNs", said Paul Triolo, global technology manager at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm.
"A more complex environment for users to navigate and new capabilities and approaches will simply allow China to better disable certain parts of VPN usage in Beijing at a chosen time and place", he said.
The Chinese people learn to cope with these difficulties at an early age.
Earlier this summer, Chinese internet giant Tencent began limiting the time for those under 18 to play the popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing those under 12 to play for an hour a day and 12 to 18 for two hours.
That is why young people in China have begun to use an ancient solution - fake documents.
"Is your Honor of Kings game time limited?
Are you interested in obtaining a document that shows you are over 18?" asked a recent ad on Chinese social media.
"No problem with that.
Please contact us to obtain a document at a low cost".
The Agricultural Museum will evaluate the Estonian heavy goods vehicles tomorrow
This Saturday, 5 August, the Estonian Agricultural Museum is hosting the Day of the Weightlifting People of Estonia.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of the three Estonian horse races, alongside the Estonian horse and the Thoroughbred horse.
This year, the 23rd World Heavyweight Day will be held and a total of 17 heavyweight trucks will be present across Estonia.
On this day, the young Estonian heavyweights, spots and wet ones are compared and evaluated.
In addition, the work of the best developers is recognized.
The total number of Estonian heavy-duty vehicles at risk is more than 350.
The maintenance of the horse and the use of the horse are also introduced in the Supremes.
On the same day, visitors can visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, see the EV100 cereal crop and grain crop and participate in thematic workshops.
Any visitor of any age can find a job.
Children have fun games, the opportunity to ride a pony or a horse, participate in a drawing contest, and visit the Three Little Pigs Research Theater.
There is also a summer market offering Estonian food and handicrafts.
The day of the Estonian heavyweights is organised jointly with the Estonian Society of Horticulturalists, the Estonian Society of Horticulturalists and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The producers are supported by the Estonian Association for Residual Growth.
The Genie was named Cat of the Year.
The rescued cat who supported her owner during a bone cancer outbreak was named National Cat of the Year.
Genie was recognized for comforting her owner, Evie Henderson of Lincoln, 11 during six chemotherapy sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016, and Genie's company, she says, helped her cope with several painful surgeries and her long hospital stay.
The cat was recognized by the cat charity Cats Protection at a ceremony in London.
Image caption Evie says the cat was there to support her when she lost her long brown hair due to chemotherapy
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me", Evie said.
"He came to my bowl's foot and sat by my feet.
He sniffed the chicken and then jumped on the couch to slap me on the knee.
When I was too sick to have friends visit or go out, and I had to sit at home, he came to me, and it made me much happier, offering great comfort".
Evie says that she has a special bond with her pet, which was a tremendous support when she lost her hair due to the painful treatment.
"It made me very angry because I had long brown hair.
But as spring was upon us, Genie shaved her hair the same way, and the fact that I had lost my hair and Genie had lost mine eased the shock a little bit".
Chris Henderson, Evie's father, said that the cat has been "a great distraction", describing how Evie used to watch videos of her beloved in the hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to look forward to when she got home for some precious day".
"I missed her every day I was in the hospital", says the 11-year-old, "and my family said she missed me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I'd do without him".
Report: Mueller summoned the entire jury in a Russia investigation
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that a special prosecutor investigating possible ties between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign has convened a panel of jurors.
The paper reports that the swearing-in panel is a new and significant development in the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump or his top advisers kept a secret plan with Moscow to promote the 2016 Republican presidential campaign.
NBC News has previously reported that before Mueller, the former FBI director who now leads this critical investigation, was appointed, prosecutors used sworn collections to investigate the actions of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign leader Paul Manafort.
One of the president's personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he was unaware that Mueller had begun using all the sworn men.
"We've been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1 because we want to get to the bottom of this", he said.
"In light of the news of the entire federal summons, we have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation".
NBC News has not independently confirmed the Journal's data.
The use of a collection of evidence is a normal part of a complex investigation and is not only a tool for hearing testimony but also for obtaining information and obtaining data from individuals or companies.
It's a powerful tool prosecutors can use to press charges and summonses, and it could indicate that Mueller's work is far from done.
Trump has denied that he or any member of his team had any plans with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied any involvement in Trump's surprise victory last November.
Special counsel to the president, Ty Cobb, said he was unaware that Mr. Mueller had begun using all new sworn officers.
"The bond with the gang is usually classified", Cobb said in a statement.
The White House supports anything that speeds up the fair completion of his work.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Former FBI Director Jim Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed".
"Flying American" under a black ship
Of course I've heard of flying ships.
Who wouldn't?
The wings travel between Tallinn and Helsinki several times a day.
It's not anything special.
The Swiss company Supramar introduced the first "foil" boat, the Freccia d'Oro, or Golden Arrow, in 1952.
Technology has been around before, but now I'm facing a wind-powered base.
Catamaran, but still sailing.
What's the wrong with this thing going up?
However, let us avoid lying (which is not difficult to find) and let us look at the simple farmer's concept of "foiling".
Why are planes in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that when the aircraft is propelled forward at high speed, the air flowing under and above the wing at different speeds, due to the pressure difference, produces an aerodynamic lifting force that at one point exceeds the weight of the aircraft and lightens the air of the entire machine.
The same process is practically happening in water.
The right wing, moving at high speed, generates lifting force, which in turn raises the "steady" base out of the water.
It's easy, right?
It gets complicated when it comes to numbers.
The aircraft needs a minimum of 150 to 250 km/h to take off, and the world record for sailing is currently 121.1 km/h.
But let's not get in the way of high school physics!
Today I came to see a flying catamaran called NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA is a name coined by the chairmen of the North American Catamaran Racing Association.
FCS is short for Flight Control System.
It's a system that allows the crew to set the ground even in the middle of the flight, and 20 shows the length of the boat on foot.
As soon as the catamaran is released from the covers, it's clear that this isn't the Lord's Sunday robbery.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametv stayed at the dock today.
The pipe and the glasses didn't fit on board.
This is hardcore.
That's the speed in Cuba.
"Is that a carbon drink?" I ask, pointing to the ship.
Yeah, it's all carbonated.
"All the pussy then?" I don't really understand.
"No, the whole boat", is the answer.
170 kilos - the three of us who go aboard will definitely weigh more than 170 kilos.
I'm comparing everything from laundry to night cars, and I can't get around that either - the NACRA F20 is like a skydiving weapon that's not suitable for road use.
It's a fucking Zonda R or a Ferrari FXX.
Built with one specific purpose in mind: to drive well and quickly under controlled conditions.
A hobbyist would also be haunted by the amount of security equipment that must be used before going to sea.
Waterproof suit, slippers, special-purpose boots, sailboats, canoes, special life support, helmet.
The arsenal has a feeling that in addition to the oxygen balloon and the sea, Mars could be colonized.
"So there's a good chance we're going to change?" I ask in a funny tone.
"Yes", is the short answer.
"Have you been around a lot?" I'm still probing the surface.
I'm not kidding.
I mean, fasten the seat belt.
The objective is also highlighted by the fact that the Nacra F20 FCS needs a auxiliary boat and at least two crew crews to reach the sea.
Three at most, so there's not much room.
It's starting to get to me why it's not a Sunday cruiser.
The forest of Leil " Blog Archive " Land and road improvements
I am now inevitably obsessed with any sort of land reclamation work, whether in the forest or in the fields.
The quality of machinery and work has improved significantly and everything is happening more efficiently than it was at the time.
Today, the main task is to reconstruct and repair former earthworks, find and repair defects and faults.
Tighter environmental requirements have increased that were not addressed for decades.
Building materials have been upgraded, such as plastic tubes, which replaced earlier iron pipes, and cloth, so-called geotextile, which is used to secure the tie-bins in addition to the stones.
The mouths and troops were previously secured with cast concrete slabs (MP, CPC) and mortar.
In order to protect the environment, settlements are dug before the drainage water (underground drains, crawls) reaches natural streams or rivers and are also collected for the purpose of cleaning the water from possible residues of pests and toxins.
The seeds of new septic tanks or shrubs are often planted or grow on their own from the seeds that have flown there.
Hundee have a habit of filtering out toxic substances from the water.
The tick in the picture was dug last year and this week the tick's tip was leveled to the ground, a concrete ring mine was built to collect fire water.
And to prevent any machine from burning the tick, they must have moved large stone slabs to the square.
In the surrounding area, the clearing of farmland is also involved in improving forest roads.
The inter-forest road section in the picture should be part of the valleys, which also become additional crossroads.
On the right is the national forest, with the reconstructed road continuing immediately from the crest to the right and soon to be completed.
There's a rainforest on the left.
The road to the valley continues and there is also the renewal of the crop gravel and road and the correction of the identified drying defects.
