The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria: 29%
The perceptible weakening of both parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the deputy prefect of Kärnten, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the vote, but it has lost 5.5% since the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the case for ÖVP, which lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results for these two major parties in the postwar history of Austria and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular vote, which led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the LÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advantage over the SPÖ in the preferences.
But the voters have obviously punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday during the extraordinary party leadership meeting.
This development should perhaps ease the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
As for the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% and the BZÖ only 11% of the vote - but the Social Democrats simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) which was even the reason for sanctions by the European Union.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States which are not in a position to participate in the European Union.
The Greens also managed to enter the Parliament, but fell slightly, falling from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has obviously passed the 4% threshold and not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally harvesting beetles in India is not resolved, there will be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
'If it is not resolved, then it will be a bit of a cooling off,' he said after the meeting, which was organised on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive branch can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling, which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved", said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then you can apply for bail and await sentencing.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same during the negotiations.
"Recommend appeal to the High Court then you can get pardon", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to provide the convicts with 'competent legal support', the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time, he said that such support was already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining the best relations we have had with India for many years.
Even the Indians admit it", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
The Minister did not answer the question whether he had obtained a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I got relatively many promises", he merely noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It is close to the electronic map on the wall that shows Australia and its adjacent marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent, but in a little spot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a 33-person team in the UNO Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, the Czech lawyer who heads the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
The will to work and enthusiasm prevail.
The seabed still conceals a little-known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other minerals, but also previously unknown living organisms that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of the medicine against cancer.
The deepest on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
The UNS Convention means that they are taking advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the State in question.
He has an exclusive right under the convention to all the resources on the continental shelf.
"In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea, often over 200 nautical miles", explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very extensive technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful", Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia's vast expansion of its marine possessions has had a worldwide impact.
But New Zealand has also gained from this - the seabed area, which was allocated to it by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 square kilometres, so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The future profits from the seabed, they promise, will be priceless.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do this for ten years from the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor that the Convention has declared the common heritage of humanity begins".
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right to extract in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike", says Mikulka, exaggerating, "in that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime established by contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc in the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, the Convention granted the company, along with investors from a few other countries, the status of a pioneer investor.
It has mining rights in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is scraped, it's a near-submarine replica of the Tatry.
"It is possible to mine on a total area of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic aggregates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", explains another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A worker in the Macedonian division, Rober Sandev, brings a find with him to show.
It looks like a little potato or with a little imagination, a legendary pattern, like in the legend of the Golem's awakening.
German special forces were present at the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in freeing the hostages  the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special forces were ready, but they did not intervene.
We are receiving increasingly detailed information on the circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 European hostages.
The rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, involved German special forces.
In addition to the army specialists, GSG9 units, the Federal aviation police, the Federal Criminal Bureau as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on the spot.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, in view of the danger of a forceful intervention, released the hostages by running away.
The Egyptian government has accepted the German offer of assistance, to join as assistance directly on the ground.
"We didn't get there by chance", says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
On 19 September, a group of travellers - five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions - were abducted in southern Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were taken to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was kept secret until the end as were the details of their release or possible ransom payments.
The freed men meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't elaborate on the release details.
There was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", the five holidaymakers and the special units are scheduled to fly out on an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones has fallen.
By 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite calls from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program, which should have stemmed the chaos in financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters have tried desperately to persuade critics of the hefty $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged the deputies to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
It's hard to be grateful for something that hasn't happened yet.
While the vote was in progress the Dow Jones plunged more than 6 percent or 600 points.
THE reason for the investors' concern was that the state rescue package might fail.
It recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the bankruptcy announcement, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The programme must be approved by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate before it can take effect.
Promoters record increasing bookings
It looks like it 's going to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the turnover of travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak economic prospects, the desire to travel among Germans remains strong, according to one survey.
Travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in winter season bookings compared with the same period last year, the German tourism association DRV reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the market research institute GfK, booking quotas are already increasing for the autumn months.
The surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would therefore amount to about 11%, the DRV reported.
The figures are based on the figures of the GfK, which analyses booking data from 1200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and draws up statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly in demand, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey, Greece and locations within Germany would be particularly popular travel destinations for Germans.
All-inclusive travel is particularly popular, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising costs of energy and foodstuffs, the costs in this case would be 'better calculable for customers than for an individually organised holiday'.
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts on bookings made well in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months would also have been a good year for bookings, with a surplus in turnover again compared to the previous year - although according to a further study the number of Germans taking a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, one-litre beer and VIPs in branded Dirndl.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV presenter and wears a custom Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
But we have one thing in common: just three minutes at Wiesn, and already photographers are jumping on us and taking pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras  very flattering, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The dirndl seems to be achieving its purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn and a resident actually north of the equator of the white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to this day remains within limits.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, it's not that big of a deal.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed  all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron gets weird looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun pointed out that I would have tied the apron wrong: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind you a widow".
I'm going to sneak in and fix the bow from back to left.
All right", he says and laughs.
Others waste less on subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their bare buttocks against an uninvited person.
The boy with the exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he's from England and he's also visiting Oktoberfest for the first time.
She thinks it's gorgeous, with a "ooooo" twist.
This one tells me, after he got rid of his pint-sized beer mug before.
Right next to one of these fire hydrants, which everyone thinks is a garbage can.
I mean, Bob is one of those notorious "Wildbieslers".
Others are not so fortunate as to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m., the paramedics, who are supposed to take care of the poor, walk in packs on the party grounds.
The nurses appear in packs at all times  always four at a time dragging a stretcher covered with a tent into a tent.
This works like most visitors to Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever's lying under the curtain in this blood alcohol coffin, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the paramedics shouts at me and disappears into the ravine.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the town.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building sits between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking out at the world like some German provincial town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling to the vault, there was no doubt about the greatness of the enterprise of what was the farthest passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East by means of this railway that ran from Damascus to Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions were dashed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The isolation of the region from the surrounding region, created by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for the station in Hyderpasha too.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly decaying, largely outdated by history.
But today, this railway outlet to Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-widening diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
Now there's a new policy of engagement.
The Turkish government has remarkably good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading experts on foreign policy of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bouncing race down the tracks that produced the old world rhythms of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has suggested some suspicion in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built on purpose - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized shopping malls and power pastry shops, where business executives in suits - both men and women - meet to make contracts early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry too.
"The foreign policy party's goal now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't one or the other.
It must be both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey", he says, "does not want to face that choice".
It also points out a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has memorized: the links of the European Union not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel along those railway lines eastward through Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night of no light, I think of those two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle East ambitions may now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating country.
Remembered by Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As music director of Guildford from 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 11 September) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As a member of his municipal music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21s and under 21s, but by the time the Proteus played its finale in 1979, many of us were in our 20s - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the choir's goodwill and ability to tackle anything music presented to do, whether madrigals or Messiaen, unaccompanied or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flourishing.
Whatever the musical standard was, he was raising it higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor were to be knighted, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I've seen over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never disagreed with a single one of them - and many times been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "ridden around the world on one or two well-known war horses".
We're all gonna miss him.
I 'm not going to lie .
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he resumed his study of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman... studying simultaneously for a bachelor of science, a master of letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it is incorrect.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They caught my attention because of the simplicity and strength they conveyed, while treating the protagonists with special respect.
A show that conveys a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments".
Second round of robberies at Honda supermarkets
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already very habitable, this new minivan has even more interior space.
Added to this is a refined mechanical system that increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically similar to the previous model, there are many changes to the car.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we go on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation entered the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch expects to sell about 2,000 Jazz units within a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will enable Honda to reduce the fall in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the company's managers expect to end the year with a total of 22 000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% decrease.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To do this, Honda is counting on another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door, compact hybrid - 14 feet (4.37 m) long - that the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets, and according to the estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, with the remaining percentage being split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's January launch in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is up to 12 feet [3.90 m], width is up to 4 feet [1.69 m], and the intersection is up to 8 feet [2.50 m], an increase of two inches [5 cm].
The height, however, remained unchanged at 5 feet 6 inches (1.52 m).
As the size increases, so does the habitable interior.
This advantage is due to the addition of a new platform and the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also used in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage compartment - with double-backrest - rises to 399 litres, or 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the dimensions of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external features such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the windscreen - concern an improvement in rear seat accessibility.
The doors that allow access to the rear seats, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in models with a 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology which allows for lower fuel consumption, less carbon dioxide emissions, mechanical optimisation and at the same time maintains high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model is rated at 90 hp at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion  - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared with the previous drive, which used 83 horsepower in the first-generation model, 100 are now available.
The Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The Bee Car to Avoid Collisions
In developing accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, and in particular bees.
A Japanese company has created a robot that can avoid accidents by taking the flight of bees, for example.
It's the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technology Center at Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is an extension of the four-area Safety Shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the bees' compound eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle of over 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly uninterruptedly in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they call a laser location finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles that are in front of the BR23C within a radius of two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a onboard microprocessor that immediately, allows to prevent the collision.
"The minute it detects an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at right angles or higher to avoid a collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot veer up or down, not even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn, and not by exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can run without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or megabyte".
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
Trembling Before Asking for a Loan
We must recognize that the US Treasury, besides having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing to junk loans in dubious insolvent banks, they created a fun and educational game for Internet users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credit"... or trouble.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to make you think not once, but twice or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
The information provided by the game is certainly useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more of a teen page than a general audience site.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house is not even a...
Morgan Stanley opens up its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it has signed an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan, to invest $9 billion in a 21% stake in the company, following a sharp drop in its stock market.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum equal to $3 billion.
The price fixed is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest USD 6 billion in the purchase of convertible bonds at a conversion price of USD 31.25 and will ensure a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per share, which is below its current rate of 28%.
By 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into a bank holding company", explained John Mack, managing director of the US group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to differentiate its stock, but still bring it under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious approach than they did before.
The terms of the deal agreed on Monday also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: on Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's executive director, explained: "We thought our share of the stake would be made up entirely of common shares.
But given the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
The transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.'
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares within a year if, over a given period, they are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at about USD 47.
Morgan Stanley claims that the capital provided by MUFG would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment,Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to have a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "significantly" lightened its balance sheet as of the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a tough one for the group, as its stock has halved in value while the cost of risk insurance has skyrocketed.
The cost of the newly created electricity was still high on Monday, at around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa in Quito, we are on Monday.
To found the republic on a socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
On Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the European Parliament is able to take part in the negotiations on the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union.
According to these results, 28% voted "no", while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% blank.
For the draft constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and an estimate by a non-governmental organization announced a landslide victory for the "yes" side, putting it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
"The Constitution has triumphed gloriously", he assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was conducted in complete calm according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a 444-point text designed to consolidate the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
This draft constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and has the possibility to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-apply for a new term in February 2009.
The constitution also states that free health and education services are to be provided, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a launching point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the 11 tourists and their eight companions kidnapped 10 days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
The hostages, who appeared to be in good shape, arrived at the Almaza military base near Cairo International Airport at about 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were immediately transferred by helicopter, without being able to give any press interviews, to Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They are in "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers", Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists  five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian  and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the manager of Aegyptous, the safari organising agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces personnel aboard two helicopters launched the night-time assault just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the rest fled", said the official, who asked not to be named.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism and to the fight against terrorism.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence people, of our special forces", he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army patrol had said that they had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers and killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two.
The army said the kidnappers were linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page is a debate on the financing of culture, which is the focus of the current election campaign.
That's all the better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will speak out against the meager sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or starving national historic sites?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying 3.5 million euros for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
For our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that says that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, in 211 societies for the safeguarding of historical, genealogical, archival and heritage heritage, preserve, with four dollars, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate developers and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be given to history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first bank in Europe to be in difficulty as a result of the US credit crisis, by partially nationalising it. The three countries will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands reached agreement at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
The first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the difficulties which have been plaguing the international financial market for more than a year was that of Fortis Bank, and in some respects the decisions taken in this respect may set a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's stake in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first and foremost the assets, mainly insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' shares began a vertical slump, with serious signs of the firm's crisis emerging in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's stock fell almost 12 percent on Friday, its lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
At current share prices, the total capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The company's top executives attribute the collapse in Fortis stock to uncertainties in the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the stock slowly picked up.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come up with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had previously assured investors that they should not fear losing their money.
The bank's customers did not panic, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The Fox in the Chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people's medical purchase records, often refuse to take out insurance.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program where the use of prescription data is always subject to the consent of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, or it is like leaving the chicken coop to the fox". - quoting Richard Dick, author of the prescription drug program, as writing in The Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of claims dependent on the health of the prospective customer and, if they consider the risk too high, do not insure.
In the past, the customer had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only concluded after the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure 10 years ago: the customer's ID code allows you to easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines you have bought in the last year and a half and from this the program can tell you what diseases you have and what your health condition is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, this means that your blood fat level is practically incurably high and you are classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the programme on the market, some of which also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not have much to do with paperwork, although there are some minor difficulties.
The downside is that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are used for migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance-commercial point of view, is a factor of risk, the first two are not.
Separate companies have been set up for the purpose of requesting and processing data and they ask for the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
Now the authorities force them to do so even though they have not yet imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies are also processing lab results and linking them to drug consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time it will become increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a separate privacy law but it only applies to healthcare and insurance.
The Commission has already proposed a new law to give the authorities the power to supervise data service companies.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: he has therefore developed a programme which links the transmission of data to the consent of the person concerned.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
So in the end the chickens are left to the mercy of the fox.
The overall menu of Marseilles
EU and India double trade
As the EU and India are trading partners, the ninth summit's agenda was dominated by this issue, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a major democratic power which should have a greater say in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So this question was not raised at the ninth summit in Marseilles yesterday.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they reached an agreement to double trade in five years, i.e. to increase it to EUR 100 billion.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
The result is that the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements have been legally unified, so that air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance this, because while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
They called for the establishment of a UN conference on the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and on terrorism, which was condemned in all its forms by both sides.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, even though both sides played a role in its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will continue to pursue its energy and climate agenda, which aims to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees with this, and that a global pact should be agreed at the climate conference next year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French firms will receive a 20 billion euro contract to build the Indian nuclear reactors.
According to our press agency, the agreement will last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
The Italian publishers were present at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries to occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honor.
The Italian Government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally present with a Punto Italia - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
The press conference will follow in Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse, where figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy will be presented.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children, is gradually decreasing.
We found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson has dispelled any remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and we now have confirmation that this is the very one that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he said at a press conference.
The sheriff then said that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The US Transportation Safety Board (TSB) said that a team of investigators was dispatched a few hours after the wreckage was spotted and identified the aircraft as the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
It's two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was discontinued a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long line of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world balloon flight - a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he had made the round-the-world flight nonstop.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you're not expecting
An out-of-the-ordinary SUV with an original design and well-defined by sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in short, the latest born among the "compact" offroad of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of novelty in this sector.
The launch of the Suv Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus, the advertising that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-shows, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the picture, you'll get the impression that the car is coming out of the billboard.
The new GLK will then be illuminated at different times in all its details, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, and then reassembled into a single image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will this formula be able to pique the interest of future buyers?
That's what Italian hooligans are.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the national team for years and that, in truth, has never created any excessive problems.
He'd never even fought opposing fans.
The extraction group is on the right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by small groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags showing the militants' hometowns: they were removed on Saturday night to avoid identification.
They're inspired by English fanfare.
In Bulgaria they found a fan club of real Nazis, the Levski's.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominative, so easily controllable.
And the Viminale had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been prevented from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a record of offenses at the stadium, had been denied a ticket and prevented from moving.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international scandal that prevents people from attending not only Italian stadiums but all of Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they're not gonna set foot in a stadium again.
Thank goodness.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, to those just over 150, more are added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way", say the Viminale.
So, "keep your eyes peeled especially in view of the national team game on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the CASMS which can also count on a section of the AISE, that is, the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"Do you know that the choirs of Duce-Duce and the outstretched arm during the hymn of Mameli are not a crime in Bulgaria?"
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste, where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to sing the Duce, but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observatory's No. 1, "the crimes must be attributed to the country where they occur.
So far this group has been in line, now we will look at what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not a crime, but if you allow me they are not politeness... "
