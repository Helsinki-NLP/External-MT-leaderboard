Barack Obama is the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
He will be awarded the $1.4 million Diploma, Medal and Cheque for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time with the five members of the Committee who selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple are scheduled for an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. President to receive the prize, but only the third to receive the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He reinforced the war effort even a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which no one of his critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check worth ten million Swedish kronor (approximately €1.1 million).
He plans to donate it to charity, but he has not yet decided specifically which.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was quite reluctant to this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He has also repeated several times that this is not a prize for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement, he said it would be for him a “invitation to action.”
Man accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police have charged with blackmail the president of the association of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal gain in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, a spokeswoman for the Litoměřice police.
The President of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and risks up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting stalls are not perfume in Brno
In Prague everybody can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you get on sorting benches in every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you will need to take several minutes before you find the right bands.
I do not mean that we would not sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councils of our city, the second largest city in the country, do not care enough about this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of items dedicated to these waste.
Have you ever tried to throw out a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires time and iron nerves above all.
The only place I have found for now is the Moravian Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not want me to, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it is not a secure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort out their waste.
By the lazy.
It makes them a trolley to get to the benches.
I am not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw a few glass and PVC bottles.
Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any of the colors on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the train.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
After all, it’s the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, isn’t it?
It is likely that ecology and an alleged aestheticism are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy from the city a place in the first hockey league that embarrasses the city across the country, instead of buying a few additional properties and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am pleased to have been able to confirm my impression with official statistics after pulling a moment on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget cut off Argentina's pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or officials, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international legal proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they relied on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave.
The interest on borrowed money is increasingly high and will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice of where to get the money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or spending, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and don’t have to worry about their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state debt - next year there will be no shortage of 163 billion in the treasuries, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow more and more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also be missing five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and started sections of which it is not possible to modify the plans to eventually reduce costs.
You can use them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major workshops, and the collection of European funds is also at risk, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very cleverly - it will draw in the dividends of the ČEZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the state owns mostly, and will feed the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividends is never certain and it is in no way a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were shipped from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the elimination of environmental damage, to supplement the pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
This is far from the end of the carnival.
The budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is unlikely that the state can do without this money.
It is a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, in the worst case, touch the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million to the two-billion-dollar State Treasury project, which should allow online tracking the expenses of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just a button and you will be switching from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional.
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB of RAM, which ran the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on the rise.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices as of 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains plagues hotel owners
Deserted trails are a problem only for slopes operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking right now.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate too much to book.
If you prioritize savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Spindler hotels currently only offer a one-week stay for the New Year.
I think they will try another moment to place them, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas is the most important time for us at this time, it is not fully sold.
There is still, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats.
The first fourteen days of February go just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” Schiefert thinks.
In contrast, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
There is an improvement of about five percent.
There are still a few places left for Christmas and New Year.
There is a great interest during the Polish January holidays and February sells well too,” says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year's season.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the moment.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow will fall, interest in stays in the Krkonoše will surely still grow, said Omnia hotel director Erik Sporysch.
However, hotel owners should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there are rainfall, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But then the weather is expected to warm up, reports Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comic, the stubborn effort with which Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of wise, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he considered himself very simple.
When he ended up letting his long-awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper from Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even the phrase "like in Iraq" several times, he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward."
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, which came from recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only one that was possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers currently don’t talk about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favorable final situation than one could hope.
Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
Again, it was campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House’s reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It managed to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most trouble in Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this whole process within three years.
Many have doubts that a half increase will bring the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan stands out in the exact opposite – no one can rely on and no treaty is observed.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although formally founded, will remain the dust behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “state of prompt action”, which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy confuses by its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of the war in view of their "swift return home" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will see it as an indirect acknowledgment of the American defeat.
The recent NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is negatively oriented.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the heightened sanctions do not have any effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of solving the problem using military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will result in a dramatic reversal of the situation in Afghanistan.
The only rust for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to come up with a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism about its wage practices.
The group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to sell until five years.
The actions can be withdrawn from the leaders in case they would take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to link wages with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global direction to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting aside $17 billion in premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the emergence of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political topic in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to impose a fifty-percent tax on bonuses for bankers exceeding £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, received today in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research on chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israeli scientist Ada Jonath and American scientists Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner of the Nobel Prize in economics was American economist Elinor Ostrom and her fellow economist Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not win this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith withWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
This is up to ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the prize among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was presented to US President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
He, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his journey and that he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable to peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and also Janota’s position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
He also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further aggravates the public finance crisis.
President’s spokesman Radim Ochvat about the meeting.
Janota will then discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted to Klaus’s signature, it is a deficit of SEK 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Representatives on Wednesday endorsed the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats’ proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, disagreement that questioned the future of Fischer’s cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Party of the Greens.
Critics argue that the budget, as voted by MPs, removes the savings package passed by Fischer’s government, which he says should curb the state’s debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but is not obliged to do so, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "irrepressible deficit" of public finances.
At the moment, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvement, if it could rely on a wider consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is scary and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for next year a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman Will Play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's New Movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Unbeaten will expose the world to a lot about the country, its battles and victories.
The story talks about sport, interracial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, the tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was an eighty-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to her, “If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby drama set in the middle of boxing, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement who became himself a slave, a fictional U.S. president, or even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important to so many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincible and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and South African rugby team captain François to unify the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually progress to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked a few years to bring the story of Mandela to the big screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role in a way that would bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
My biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I stretched your hand, I recovered from your energy, it was transmitted and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the guidance of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and even talks about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety magazine summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-directed film."
In the ratings of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
Norwegian aura mystery solved: Russians tested a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry has acknowledged that it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the Bulava-type missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually becomes the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it damaged itself in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th trial took place normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there were damage to the device again.
It was apparently the third-floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a boat in motion and submerged.
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a faulty Bulava.
Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
Generals argue that this time, we can’t talk absolutely about failure.
The first two floors of the rocket survived and the damage only affected the third.
In previous cases, the engines had faults on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Defense Ministry’s leadership considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent thus fills the generals with optimism and so they still say that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will once again appear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will probably make his entry already during Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the CSKA president.
After Denis Kuliash’s injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details about the form, said the club's coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by AP.
It is unclear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will involve only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, he won the Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also earned tribute in the NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Temple of Hockey Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to trade unions and cancelled every overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel any overtime.
Due to the frequent overtime, the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai’s spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to reach an agreement with the trade unions on a Saturday work this year.
We can’t give up our production plan, it’s essential, that’s why voluntary extra hours were proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The site Sedmička.cz that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded afterwards for the working day on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for extra hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their year-end holidays specified by Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot point in comments and claims from unions such as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, workers in the automobile factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions are hoping to cancel the strike after the agreement is signed.
The next negotiation between the car factory management and trade unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday they were ready to end the strike state if agreement was reached on their demands and a joint document was signed.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of unceasing overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged buzzing.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in supplement to meet the requirements in terms of automobile production.
In the announcement of the strike on Monday, trade unions also demanded that workers who cease production be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions are calling on the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (approximately €209) for them this year.
Hyundai’s Nošovice automobile plant currently employs 2,000 people.
It began serial production last year in November.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: A Substance That Works on “Tolerant” HIV Viruses Too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
There is no cure for AIDS at the moment.
However, the life of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, the VŠCHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metal-carborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbonates are a combination of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that’s why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new “improved” substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds to the virus’s proteins.
Metal carbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
An insidious and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, it will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in samples and its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the conventional version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on resistant versions against which conventional drugs are often ineffective.
Metallocarbonates, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to be further examined to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Disputes around the budget: ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
ODS (Democratic Civic Party) chairman Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified for the following year "shoking" and he said Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS’s remarks a drastic verdict.
It takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether the House of Deputies should rely on the minority that is concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned with staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the 2010 budget, with proposals for amendments of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s grievance over the social-democratic proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, thus obeying the government’s wish that a revised budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met with the prime minister on Monday after his passage to the government:
He said at the same time that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not concerned.
This is the matter of the head of government Fischer and of the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a text statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are demanding the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a struggle against the amount of the public deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the leftist majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, Defense Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS made a step back on the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not explicitly asked the Democratic MPs to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel like we are orphans, we are not small children, he reacted to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered reproaches from the party president in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not realize that my vote was missing.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all that was positive.
According to the new ČD timetables, there will be fewer trains for identical tariffs.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some express or less loaded regional trains from December 13 and will strengthen some others.
The total transport coverage will be reduced by 2 percent on the day of the new timetable entry into force compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including base tariffs and reduced tariffs.
It is for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, Railways will add a pendolino barrel.
Instead, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transportation is in the Hradec Králové region of eight percent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the biggest transformations can be seen the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for now the inhabitants of Milovice must move to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year’s bill for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not resort to a price increase for the vast majority of transportation tickets.
The changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and discounted eLiška internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the journey taken, while until then it was valid between cities in a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still detain more than 50 people, children released
Rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency who this, but spoke at the outset of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The attack took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a escape from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
The rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police initially pursued the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines following a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the election of the governor’s administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
They resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film is coming to the U.S. in the coming days, titled Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Undefeated), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to portray him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the film’s arrival in theaters, the feedback of critics and the public is being heard.
by Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains high hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by worrying news about the rise of racial conflict and discrimination against the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations issued to the main roles where Hollywood stars "past".
Morgan Freeman is proud of the film.
I have been dreaming about this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I also personally met Nelson Mandela many times to be able – as they say – to recover from his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if one has the opportunity to recall through the film Mandela’s personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wearing the National Rugby Team Shirt
The film is based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated.In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term at the presidency.
Morgan Freeman thus tries during the film to gather two racial groups from a long-divided population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he enters the South African national team shirt on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had then won.
For showing up on the shirt lawn, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela was long applauded fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" in the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tensed situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently told LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformator worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire in the morning swallowed a processor of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for the Ústí fire department, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformator consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformator will have to be replaced with a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company Čeps has not experienced anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, says ČEZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire at the processing plant.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Itins, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transmission sets to distribution sets and lines of a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jančura will file complaint for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will today file a complaint for defamation against three Social Democratic prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said this in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company’s attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we were making the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
We only have to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slandering the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also said he has evidence that no region has acted in accordance with EU law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura’s complaint represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr. Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek said.
Jančura has already announced last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the adverse actions of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the wider sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the operation of rail connections to the Czech Railways for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jančura threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn’t stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who he is, but I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices that health insurance will pay for vaccines.
Experts also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccine.
Free vaccines for children.
From January, children born last year after August 2 can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started the vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
However, the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
Until now, the state spent around 500,000 crowns a year on all children’s vaccinations.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions about a possible vaccine obligation in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference at which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have optional vaccination.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we were able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction we must now follow, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of pneumococcal vaccination.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a volunteer-based vaccination has its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a decrease in renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says however Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a breakthrough because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thereby saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This, however, is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy the vaccines through insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance companies to “deduct sums from health insurance.”
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to refund them.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum theft"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical paddle to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the news agency Associated Press (AP).
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to “enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings into a storage facility,” the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied having given such permission, the agency said.
The Labour Party supports the increase of the budget tax.
Ministers advocated the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals is a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling rate on public wages from 2011.
Anger of Social Security
Trade unions have protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and have warned that "problems" are ahead.
The decrease in Social Security—which will get around £3 billion a year—has angered the business world because he says it’s a job tax while the goal should be a boost to the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Principles of the Pre-Budget Report
Social Security will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
50% tax on bankers’ bonuses
Increase in corporate income tax for small has been abandoned
Reduced taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase of pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 per year and a person earning £40,000 will lose £190 per year, while a person earning £10,000 per year will earn £110 more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 would result in “difficult decisions” but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the top 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms dismissed an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a “drop of water in the ocean” compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important.They will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour’s forecasts of economic growth – which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled – were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his initial figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely decline by 4.75 percent this year — far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the preliminary estimate.
“A Missed Opportunity”
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the project to borrow £789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cycnically" evading difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to take place in June 2010.
“They didn’t present anything significant about what they were going to do,” said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary at the Ghost Cabinet.
"The important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner."
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from upcoming cuts, contrary to Tory’s proposals that would result in a faster and larger deficit reduction.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised from increasing taxes and decreasing spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on the wind.”
Nick Robinson, BBC's political editor, said the timetable of the announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April next year, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional aid is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
“Fake budget”
Although ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only start to feel in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor’s figures involve substantial cuts in many areas in the future, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually just delayed,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Economic Advisor for Accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report.
FBI launches investigation into “American arrest in Pakistan”
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. journalists suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been missing from their home in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, a spokeswoman for the FBI, said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether they really are the students who are missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters, but said the U.S. should "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to unroot the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were taken missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian ‘abuse’
In the past 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report shows “repetitions of violations” by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man cited in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms about its non-respect for human rights.
Authorities said such criticisms were politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
“False Confession”
Amnesty International the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'working with Facebook networks' and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he said.
“I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities have denied the allegations of rape, but have admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in an effort to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small slope preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was magnificent but rather intimidating.
It’s a beautiful view, with all the city lights shining downstairs.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country – real talents,” he added.
Prizes were awarded to the best voltages - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the hat" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls “Muslim spaces” for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts, advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who today constitute a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He asks himself how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so virulently guard secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a “strictness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing into new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers, and now writers following them.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", writer and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural story of the symbol of the Great North, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The encounter with Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had only the tip of his musket to fight, is a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught while swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the area needed for an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore became green because of the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motorcycles use powerful assault rifles to hunt their cattle.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that ice will remain for the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
It is not wrong to try.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines subsequently mapped the subsoil relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice system, formed by the nets of saltwater pressed by freezing.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it may be our turn.
Marines among 6,000 people who laid crowns on Arlington tombs
First-class De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
Within a few months, from where we will be sent, we are likely to be in their place, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I’d like someone to do the same for me, that’s why I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay crowns on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife, Karen, make the trip every year, stopping in different cities along their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs at Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased military professional.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It’s like visiting a family grave.
Painted in several layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as from the Vietnam War, as these are not as frequently visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly node on top.
Close, there was silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of current wars filled the area.
Some people cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read the names engraved in the stone loudly while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, immersed in the wet soil for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She left from Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to come to gather at the tomb of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget what makes us free... my son paid for that, she said.
"Long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
US citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who distributed cell phones and mobile computers across the country, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based at Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The exact accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous.”
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and she is monitored and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but permits have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of the Brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government take concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, although it is either new and desirable consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often need to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch group, who recently released a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government is often provoking a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly preparing a conspiracy to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan with the aim of killing U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who foam the internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them join the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north became a refuge of terrorism.
They were seen as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed themselves on the condition of keeping the anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to get access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men—who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI—insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the priority of U.S. intelligence has been to infiltrate men into the al-Qaeda network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to be increasingly careful in recent years in choosing people they accept as U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following his recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater climate action from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center congress palace.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of disguised activists fired a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city center.
On this day when little happened during the United Nations-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched around the city, placing banners in English saying ‘There is no Planet B’ and one in Spanish, saying ‘The Earth says it’s tired of it.’
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the crushing problems the country faces due to the impact of climate change that is already taking place.”
That’s one of the reasons I decided to join the big march—to make the word out and to call on leaders around the world to make just, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or possessing pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or possessing pocket knives.
According to a passenger who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothes lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "several large explosions."
Inside the Palace of Congress, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “In fact, it’s something I wasn’t aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating, “As the event is important, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He noted that walking may seem harmful or useful depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors in the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week’s federal math results report brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
While the District is still far behind the top establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-American and white performance, both locally and nationally.
The average score of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington D.C. has increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but that of their African American classmates has increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between black and white in Grade 4 (cm1) class when the first District NAEP report was published was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Education Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in District Education.
I don’t jump joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic relative), D.C. Board Member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Graduate School).
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, targeting schoolchildren in the end of elementary and early college classes who have not incorporated the basics of reading earlier in their school path and are quite behind compared to their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten classes at Grade 6 (6th) emphasizes real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for NAEP’s progress last week.
I simply think we need to continue to work to offer better interventions to those lower-level students than the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system outcomes while providing money and resources for schools with less good outcomes in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of cities’ tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
Also, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendent of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children can get excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to reduce the success gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who agreed with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "point of departure" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whisper.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends from it and flashes for a moment to see the white columns, brick façades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
This is where I am going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the building of the sciences.
Youpi, really? said she dreamingly, when she was told of the low ratio law teacher-student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery journey and now they had fully embedded the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
While this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands benefiting from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, “one in five Hispanics of the “second generation” continues their studies at high school – a remarkable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they are paving the way for future generations that will play an important role in the country’s workforce.
Researchers who study battles say they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to offset their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college—especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with over 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies returned with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who made an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdraw, have hampered U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force into Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to account to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to get contracts with the Department.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who haveined strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, have left empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has been more engaged in contracts than other companies and has returned with significant shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on the same level as its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit auctions made offers that were then compared to the barrel rate that the ministry agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the leading al-Qaeda organizers killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of al-Qaeda operations organizers this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan province, according to U.S. and Pakistani sources in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by a drone of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchist tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of the Pakistani civil intelligence service said, speaking to Miran Shah's phone.
Authority representatives said suspicious local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally crushed bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the victims' identities, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda’s military organizing leaders who directed the group’s terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracies around the world, one of the officials said, who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somalia had rapidly advanced into al-Qaeda’s ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general U.S. public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure of al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, along with three other operators.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has decreased since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspicious whistleblowers, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul Retires
The U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign in March after a tumultuous mandate filled with allegations of widespread corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential election.
The departure comes after the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the deployment of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by the civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but would simply comply with the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italo-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said Galbraith’s accusations — who were thanked — “harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding international election observation.”
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed his frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the heavy UN recruitment regulations hampered his chances of bringing new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and cannot last.
Gates: Iran should face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a barracks of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, de-dramatized the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an end.”
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I’ve learned one thing in Iraq over the last six years, it’s the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” could be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons” because “his people would suffer enormously” from these sanctions.
In a statement on Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back to full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say it wants to develop its nuclear experiment only for a peaceful purpose.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant part of his storage of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed such an agreement as a means of developing trust on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have stepped away from attempts to reach an agreement – in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s resentment of some of the proposals of the international community that they actually agreed to in early October has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they hadn’t considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including continuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “enhanced sanctions.”
In a statement made Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers "in order to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before taking the plane to the oil-rich Kurdish region to confront the leaders of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. authorities have quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of Kurdistan’s regional government: “We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.”
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda preaching, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is an extra tomb."
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by their city’s insufficient birth rate and population ageing, radically changed their direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Human Resources Director and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously unique children with good cheeks and broken cheeks, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple from six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and older is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for 22 percent of the registered resident population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples need to have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of workforce in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is undoubtedly the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy risk paying colossal fines – up to three times their annual income – and being discriminated against at work.
Chinese authorities have charged the police with helping the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced women who are pregnant with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-to-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule — including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where man and woman are already single children — and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their homes, and drag out prospectuses under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the Shanghai suburb say they have seen an increase in filing applications from couples wishing for a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 – slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in Shanghai’s Caolu Municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the one-child policy to be a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It is true that we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of them herself. "We were the center of the family and had the habit that everyone took care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else, and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, says this more fiercely.
For couples working for two, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to success.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up seeing their parents fighting in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that way of life, he says.
Even a single child demands a lot of time from their parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is just 9 months old, you need to write his/her CV to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emissions reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- hitherto characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual complaints -- came back under fire on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the foreseeable future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles as well as enlightened the way to go.
But it has been seen as a major breakthrough in time-threatening negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world coming to Copenhagen next week.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much the rich countries would give to the poor to withstand global warming, ongoing and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could decrease their carbon output and what would be the upper limit of global warming that leaders would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as being “the full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, by 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and droughts or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiations, has rejected any discussion that requires reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they weren’t funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder toward China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the U.S. chief negotiator either lacked "good sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not financially help China fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major global powers at stake, gaps have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said it wasn’t surprising that major powers are struggling to know who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also climate adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure to get a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which consists of 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the action of the small island states “has put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and they are calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most issues in court before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their planes and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and news conferences, so they could make claims that will be studied over the next week.
The real picture of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Palace every day -- of guitar-playing activists presenting nighttime shows mocking countries that they believe are betraying and proposals being drafted and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all major ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the great, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle blows through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Lost small holes will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter, and switching from plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties are joining this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental hazards risk slashing British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will hand over its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in an Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split into two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a railway professional.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not be opened before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains 400m long and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham route.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it starts the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to run out of high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham,ining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from airplanes to trains, making it a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay £75,000 loan for Tory orange factory
Alan Duncan, a leading member of the Tory parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of a orangery he built in his house in his constituency.
The party leader, who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "understanding," increased his loan by £75,000 to build an oak extension at his second home, in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a control of member spending. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be “clearer or simpler.”
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland-Melton constituency.
Nearby houses were sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the remuneration office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a “veranda for pleasure.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee, regarding his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee blamed him last month for any allegations of non-compliance, following an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan modified the legal security of the 271,406 GBP loan from his London estate to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about £1,400 per month of loan interest until March last year.
In April, its requests increased by more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s RBS loan was unchanged at that time, suggesting that all increases were aimed at financing the £75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since.
The latest publication from Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask for £1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his post as Ghost Cabinet Manager in September after a cover-up journalist allegedly filmed him saying that parliamentarians had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
“In fact, it’s now national, you have to live ‘on budget’ and you’re treated as ‘of the world’.
He said, “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small portion, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I did not.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as a oil trader, began to have to explain his spending in May after it appeared he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist digged a £-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the loan increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, “It was for major improvements, approved both by the Fee Office and then by Legg.”
He added: “There’s no problem with stealing or developing or using rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler.”
Come and see the advent calendar of Brighton.
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using as a theme, Christmas songs.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with free pasta and hot wine served.
The chosen Christmas songs so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
“As a church, why are we waiting for people to enter a strange old building?
"The idea for the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we are trying to experience and represent this through spirituality.”
Climate Action in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police have conducted hundreds of arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is tasked with reaching by Friday an agreement that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped to make the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the rally, when a group of 300 demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, broke windows with stamps and hamsters, a AFP reporter said.
Police officers immediately intervened without any hesitation.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to it members of the "Black Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that werely illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred of them "were still held on the streets Saturday night" and "maintained in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Parliament party, the court, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlestick watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue marshes" for "climate justice".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt to the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: we have time, said Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you’ve never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of alter-globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands vulnerable to warming, had triggered protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were on the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas praising solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters also held rallies to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Around 131,000 people were called to participate in this first poll after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials from the Abkhazian Election Commission.
The first preliminary results were to be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict that killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is seeking to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this lush landscape region on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed somewhat across this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, paid a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in reference to Moscow’s support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, replied, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented at the vote by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the transfer to Russia of control over the Abkhazian railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide protests, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police arrested 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which is hosting delegates from 193 countries until December 18, looking for an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliamentary party, the court, generally good child, has taken the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlestick watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure, a group of a few hundred protesters, entirely dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hamsters, broke windows, a AFP reporter said.
Police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened relentlessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, precising that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that werely illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, police said.
We are watching the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters were turning in the sky.
Most of the protesters, coming by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue marshes" for "climate justice".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt to the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: we have time, said Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk when you have never done so before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of alter-globalism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands vulnerable to warming, had triggered protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were on the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas praising solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters have also rallied to call for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
History-geo comes out strengthened by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were coming out "fortified" from the reform of the general high school, despite the removal of their compulsory teaching in the scientific terminal.
From now on, primary school students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S branch is no longer a scientific branch" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain sub-branches of the S, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignate over the absence of terminal history-geography in technological high schools."
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to remove compulsory history-geography teaching in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
The minister, on the other hand, added that it was "not a matter" to remove the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teachers’ training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also take internships in position during the M2 year and then be a first year ahead of students as internship teachers.
If you add all the internships offered before the contest, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose “the individual right to education, something that does not exist in national education.”
He also reaffirmed the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge taken Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day, which takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish in the basin of the school.
Around 20 speakers are selected from among the experts in their discipline and they are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but using graphics, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that audiences will keep in mind that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record."
Videos taken from these conferences will be posted on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimestrial rate.
Delayed Payments: Anger of Prison Guards, Planned Actions
Prison guard unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of the premiums and overtime which payment was postponed in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (the 2nd syndicate of supervisors) has asked personnel who will not be in service to protest Tuesday morning in front of the prison establishments and to "block them", to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging it "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "supplementary hours, night, Sunday and holidays" worked in October.
And the first syndicate of surveillants, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), “calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger.”
The Penitentiary Administration Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime hours increased significantly in 2009 and were not all budgeted, but assure that the relics will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions guaranteeing them that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by the personnel for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to immediately put in place a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December salary will therefore be thin, except for management personnel benefiting from the famous functions and objectives premiums, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have a good back."
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and calls" until new order.
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, as well as for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux believes.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less badly looted than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the general secretary of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He'll Offer 'More Cool Tricks' Than Those He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it comes to gifts: “I give more cool things than I get.”
In a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be in the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has falsely registered against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she tainted the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before reacting with humor by pointing his finger to the First Lady’s pearl collar: “Who gave you this?”
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous host who was a fierce supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me that ball.
The first lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I didn’t really know how to organize a house so I had all the furniture aligned against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL says the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia undergone in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, precising that these lesions had "needed a reparative operation".
The singer's press service said the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday, however, was plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he has opened an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also says that "according to some sources" no drainage was placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic world.
He was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL’s information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on RTL Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured that he was not "any concern" for the rocker, who is "a beat".
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a nonsense because doing twelve hours of flight after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, said Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Camus also said he spoke with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated for a "small colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been commented abundantly. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulty moving on stage.
By mid-November, his surroundings even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro 2009/Little Basin: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in large basin, won on Thursday an international title on a distance he loves, the 50 m free swimming, at the 2009 Euro in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a breakout.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swimming and the other two by the Russian in male relays 4x50 m 4 swimming.
A regret for Bousquet, who looked at the world record in the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two royal distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet surpassed Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had planned.
You can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was in my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were wearing polyurethane clothes, which will be banned from January 1.
Originating 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t get into that race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S. Sarkophagus Panel Belonging to Zola Priced $1.5 Million
A painting of a Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above its estimate, the art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm tall, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiquity art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is the one that buyers have been looking for the most so far, a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The sign remained for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her private Paris hotel, and in Paul Reynaud, a minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
There was a shadow area of about fifty years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Abortion attempt from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of Honduras’s deposed president, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safeguard by the coupist government.
For now, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for realizing this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring back Mr Zelaya, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The coupist government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to “resign” and apply for political asylum abroad to grant him a safe haven.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as an invited head of state.
The coupist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to resign from my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
“I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar,” added the late president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has submitted to us a request for a safeguard, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya responded in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to take place as the president of the Honduran people, he said.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the coup government’s position.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had surprisingly returned on September 21 and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested in response to the crime of "high treason" which the justice accuses him, according to the coupist government.
President Roberto Micheletti has successfully organised a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress massively voted against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with figures from the U.S. trade balance testifying to the recovery of activity both in the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq, from 7.13 points to 2.190,06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.8% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different sides of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, estimating that the market was focused on “half-full glass.”
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors were mostly focused on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the deficit to rise.
Imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major U.S. trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the U.S. increased against expectation last week to 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest level in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power conspire for 'Ladies in White'
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government conspired on Thursday against the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Around forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conspired in the middle of the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a AFP reporter found.
Down the Yankees!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Viva Fidel and Raul!” scanded, the fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by civilian agents who came "to ensure their protection".
On the eve, a similar demonstration had taken place against the “Ladies in White” in Havana, with no injured or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were arrested by civilian police, a AFP reporter said.
Police force dissidents in civilian vehicles who were conspired by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
Arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Receivers of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda serves a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still in custody.
Cuban authorities view the opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” at the expense of their declared enemy, the United States.
Cuban television on Thursday the demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionary” groups.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including freedoms of expression.
A forced man kills an octogenarian with a knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man armed with two knives killed an eight-year-old and wounded five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck with two knives and for unknown reasons, an eight-year-old, in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès 85, police sources and witnesses learned.
Heavily injured, the old man, born in 1929, according to an official of the police union Alliance, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The 30-year-old man was struck and wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the eight-year-old succeeded.
The lives of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then felt ill and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the grip of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, had then fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He had injured two passers, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a four-year-old, the latter seriously.
The story was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives he was wearing in the cross behind his back, said on the spot an official of the trade union Alliance in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, according to AFP testimony, tried to control the forced.
I saw a guy about thirty years old wearing a green jacket.
Three men attempted to intercept him.
They didn’t get there because the guy was rough, Alberto, a waitress at a nearby bar,.
A crowd fell upon him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
At Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their head, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded by fisting, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Some passers came and told me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, put him in a safe position, and saw a very important wound in the abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second 30-year-old man arrived, wounded by a knife.
Police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The investigation was carried out by the departmental police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard during his detention.
A police source has not ruled out that he is being placed in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers took him to the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitation" like "all the forced of this species whose forces multiply by the effect of action."
US: Polanski's lawyer calls for suspension of prosecution
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of morals of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of "The Pianist", denounced before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband — who has since died — had talked, before delivering his sentence, with a prosecutor who had told him that Roman Polanski deserved jail — which constitutes a serious misconduct.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But at the end of September, Wells said he had "lied" to the documentary's author.
In the event that the court would refuse to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel demanded a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never been back in the United States since then.
Deputy Los Angeles County Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?
According to her, the filmmaker “requests a favor from the court, while contempting his authority.”
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to demand the abandonment of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer tolerate being harassed at every turn in the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was just.
Thirty years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months in jail, he was placed in residential detention in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, stalled by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market stretched between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, trading volume has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which “have helped improve the market’s view of the solidity of the economic recovery,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summed up.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also sharply improved in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
Indexes have, however, been hampered by a new rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which “pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3,540% against 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
Miss World Election in South Africa
After a month's journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty fair, held for the second consecutive year near Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their tickets for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were named Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African trip.
It was a real turbulence.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I’ve seen so many things and experienced so many experiences!”, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to give back my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I’m happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and presented to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with my crown, Miss India throws with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
Candidates will march in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV host, the Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to match, says Miss World President Julia Morley.
As last year, the candidates took a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma.
Not uncommon for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I met people I never thought I could get close to.
I will undoubtedly return for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was to go to the bed of his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his departure from the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after local time.
The singer's son, the air relaxed, assured that he would go "very soon" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer "was placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had previously been placed in artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to severe injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade is studying, to attend a school show, a photographer told AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I heard about a possible upcoming judicial procedure, he said.
Camus said that Hallyday had "left too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me there was no problem for this trip and it had stunned me, given that I myself had two disc hernias, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he exercised at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a sulphurized doctor, repeatedly convicted by the court, in medical accountability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of law, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said the operation was “perfectly well done” and that the post-operative examinations were “normal”.
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the placement of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be between parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens) as planned, it seems very short, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and urges the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, on Friday reacted to the attempt of the OPA of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the name of the former Giscardian party, insisting that he no longer use it on any support, under the penalty of judicial prosecutions.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after stretching his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of Deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to let themselves be deposed, came out of its silence to launch an appeal to the minister and the deputy, summoning them to no longer use the acronym and to pass on them the property of the brand, under penalty of judicial prosecutions.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you would propose to your political movement to "re-assume" the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centriste.
You also thought it was good to trace on your militant material and on the page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, also see the signatory of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which urges the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) trademark to its legitimate rightful recipients".
If you did not, the courts would be brought to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends had "choosed" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the UDF's last congress voted in 2007 for its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of a bureau charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the mark," he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently exploits the deposit absence of the UDF acronym to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironing the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you do not have a right."
Liliane Bettencourt: Francois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter accuses, he has taken advantage of an eight-year-old’s weakness to spoil part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of France’s wealthiest families, in which mother and daughter tear apart while holding the reins of the L’Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be carried out collegially by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor’s office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before 10 March 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a weak state and at what periods.
I think she will submit.
I will talk to her about it, Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said at the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court’s decision.
This is great news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (M. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal proceedings against Francois-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-to-all artist, who she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court was to examine the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers’s lawsuit, lawyers’ pleas sometimes turned to large family unpackage on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she cared about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’s husband.
In a letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I’ve never been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a custody judge has refused in recent days to comply with her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt “has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” said prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has finally decided that it will decide once the trial has taken place on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will be in vain.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees adhere to “values” determined from above, as it was once, to impose on consumers products thought by the factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors is constantly coming back!
Demobilization of employees can lead to mortal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the AI “requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision”; it requires from employees an engagement that the authoritarian management recipes completely contradict.
That’s why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
The Importance of Internal Opinion Survey
Will internal polls – such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its employees – encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
- Firstly because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure eventually, after many turns, to do as a priority ... what it has always done. !
Secondly, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionately to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the great schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American “neurosciences” and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutions of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manipulate the “levers” (sic) of the engagement of executives, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuited to the world of today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern implies adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from Motive Functional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have demonstrated that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilizing factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management back in place.
They thus create a favorable ground for the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: “Justice war” worthy of praise to Obama
The American right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who brokered the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, like Sarah Palin, a former vice president candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, told the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the topic of war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, spoke in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former chairman of the House of Representatives, who appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this speech entirely historic, Gingrich said, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen "a leftist president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former founder of George W. Bush’s re-converted Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "world citizen" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era falcon, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as “tinned, glowing and uninspired” on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we wrap war into the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The center-left press, however, remained praiseful in the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
Mr. Obama "pronounced the right speech," the New York Times said, judging it "at the same time dark and edifying."
Roads: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employer organization to remain to the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that puts an end to the strike motto and the threat on Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, “rejoiced” with this agreement, after several negotiations, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement soon in the morning.
Three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have been in charge.
But it still took more than six hours from a meeting starting at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 18 a.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The bill foresees an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and by 2.9% for the highest wages (in international transport).
In the hourly rate, for low wages, "we are going from 8.72 euros to 9,06.
It’s not much, but we’re going very far, said Patrice Clos (FO).
Or we will give orders to our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there can still be some recalcitrants who are not satisfied, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for the lowest wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and employee respect, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it “an acceptable compromise.”
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs by 3%, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable in particular to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employers' charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft rectificative finance law for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same term".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first place to the companies that are members of this organization, and in the second time, to the whole profession, if extended by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau assured.
Opposition from employer organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a “trick market” as the 100 million euros “were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transportation forced us to negotiate urgently, not as a conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to upset the turkey-eaters of the next revival.
According to Otre, the agreement “risks digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months.”
RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unhappy trade unions with RATP proposals
Disruptions on RER A, France's largest public transportation line, will continue during the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them hungry for their bonus request.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of shopping before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, with one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “the RATP is making efforts to serve the major stores.”
The RER A through the west is the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated at peak hours, and virtually no rams in empty hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the quarters, the Frenchmen organized themselves.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly because of the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up “an hour and thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive on time.”
The station Saint-Lazare did not experience saturation, the SNCF said, which had planned a management of agents and law enforcement forces.
RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metro.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "great" by the unions, of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals between parentheses, the CGT was indignant, stressing that the management "was not failing to solve a problem while in the roads and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
He also told trade unions that the company was “laughing at weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, which had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in an effort to calm down".
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for delayed hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish court dissolves pro-Kurdish party
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by rage demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just handed out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "house of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the court Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MEPs would leave the Parliament instead of sitting as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political vitrine of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, assures that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just handed out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, to try to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in southeast Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan’s detention have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the majority Kurdish-populated city in the southeast.
Law enforcement forces fired tear grenades and used water guns, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fringes.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Turk said the court’s decision would “deep the despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo to the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall.
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sand clearance service (FES) states that this is not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the technology of the vehicles and learn how to properly control them.
According to the meteorologists, this could be the end of the week.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to fight the snow and frost.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it begins to snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures fall below zero, large sanding vehicles travel 20 main routes (called routes A) .
This includes busy streets, major arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße are also included.
FES officers begin their service at three o’clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of roadway must be salted with a well-adhesive road melt, within 3 hours maximum.
This is why the FES service begins at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins."
This is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 a.m.
This poses problems, says the head of the road cleaning and sand cleaning service "because no driver is willing to let salt vehicles pass."
Then, if there is no more snow, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows well that this always causes some complaints.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets out to prioritize the areas deemed dangerous and the passages.
As for cycling trails, the FES services can generally not handle them.
Mr. Brauburger says there is a special service in Frankfurt that is responsible for monitoring the state of the bridges between 22:00 and 4:30 p.m.
Because ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
Sometimes the police also call for this special service when needed.
The birthplace of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped measured about 2 meters long for 1.50 meters tall, its rear limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with fowls and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have had anything exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, Pangea, and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds light on the evolution of the early dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us about the relationships, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says they sometimes find a dozen bones in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginning of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa from the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an entirely exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery spectacular, but he says it confirms some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify early dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Sauridae were divided into three major evolutionary groups: the Theropods (carnivores) which include the Tyrannosaurus and the Velociraptor that appeared later and descended from the birds, the Sauropods, long neck quadrupeds, and those who are related to them, and the Ornithischian herbivores to which species such as the Triceratops and the Stégosaurus belong.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the earliest theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae had small airbags in its bones at the skull level, just like the birds that are the descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small airbags in its bones.
Since the relative line of the huge sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, one can think that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three consecutive waves of migration to North America.
Since the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
Consequently, the three major lines of evolution divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. the whole of the emerging lands that formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not related to it.
The three species could not descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course, there are some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silosaure, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a misconception because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetropods of the secondary age while they originated from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread across the planet thus promoting the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
However, such a success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction in which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaurs were better adapted and so they were able to eliminate the competition on the ground.
However, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteor favoured the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that have since been vegetating in the shadow: they were mammals.
Solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is causing waves across the globe.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions from Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, he condemned the police intervention requested by the university’s board of directors.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler evacuated buildings occupied by striking students and teachers after walls and works of art were barbed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories judge that the degradations did not justify "so violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own classes."
The evacuation represents an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and education.
Focusing the attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to “delegitimate and criminalize the protest” and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forget.
The board of directors of the university therefore avoided discussions that would be indispensable.
The prosecutors demand that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradations.
Legitimation of protests
Young people from the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with students.
The protests are just the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Hesse Land Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took fact and cause for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
I would like to thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the sites is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden regional parliament last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
Parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left party (Linke).
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, they are evacuated.
The Left party has filed a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The New Silicon Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, banned from Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a secret weapons research site, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet “Silicon Valley”.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established ties with Riedberg, a place of science in Frankfurt – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of close cooperation”.
The signatories were Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
Instead, Russian scientific societies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the forested hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
We can’t put the size of the Stuttgart 21 project high enough.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The head-line stations, with routes ending in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time to be the relics of the 19th-century transportation technology, which had the effect of braking the modern railway traffic because it used to take a lot of time to move locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That’s why the headline stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train passage station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project is really going to begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of buriing the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
To be honest, the headline stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with automotive and car-pilot at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now underway alongside the new inter-city line to Ulm.
Local and regional policies have taken advantage of this.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who carries the costs of the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public company.
From an urbanistic point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space that – if you believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is detrimental.
The passage station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which was attributed – and this is typical of the 1980s – a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should primarily focus on increasing freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
But the new track, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly affects many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be engulfed in the Souabe project.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of intersection and clogging in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists in total sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to press here deeply on the mushroom.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking sabotage.
The Rhine valley route is becoming the blockbuster of international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the judgment regarding the airport
In the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, the government of the Land discussed the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal of Hesse concerning the ban on night flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review from a legal point of view the ruling of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Court of Cassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation regarding the ban on night flights in case the project for the construction of the northwest landing piste at Frankfurt airport would be realized.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 23:00 and 5:00 in the morning, as envisaged by the government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air disturbances.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to appeal in cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticizes the deadline and attempts to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and FDP to return to their pledge made before the elections to ban night flights.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Greens, Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch dismissed Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the government of the Land is still trying to allow night flights using "avocado and rubber".
It takes time to conduct a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision based on a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition’s interpretation of its faction’s statements on the ban on night flights is completely wrong.
US banks reimburse allocated aid
Major American banks, severely affected by the crisis, are disconnecting from their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to aid granted under the Tarp bailout plan.
U.S. television channel CNBC in a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursing the aid received.
The banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of amounts, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to executives as well as the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's cash, which is well filled thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to U.S. taxpayers: the capital injection significantly helped overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also considering obtaining money from the financial markets in order to free itself from state custody.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a capital increase of $20 billion on Thursday, CNBC citing banking circles.
A spokesman for Citigroup did not want to comment on the information.
In June, banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated Elections
Eventually, everything happened faster than planned.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German television channel ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin-based ZDF, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not want to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the will not to further harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 of the 14 Commissioners.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the closing of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Board voted in favour of Brender’s renewal and seven voted against.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already let go several weeks before the vote, not wanting to reinstate Brender in his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly respected editor-in-chief, citing the fact that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had dropped under Brender.
That’s why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and who considered Koch’s way of acting to be unconstitutional.
But that would have served nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romanesque languages (Spanish).
He later worked for Südwestfunk (Rhine-Palatinate radio) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first for the news magazine "heute-journal" (the newspaper of today).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimensual news show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial.
After the disgrace of Brender, when he was just elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch’s opponent in the Board of Directors, Renania-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not consider requesting the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF surveillance committees.
Peter Frey, Brender’s likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors, vehemently criticizing the commission in his decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a liberal of the left.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to show more conciliation: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of examinations: a single examination should enable the completion of the chosen study module.
Furthermore, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure “realistic and acceptable proportions”.
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less exams
Since the start of student protests in June last year, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and university rectors have constantly used the famous phrase: “studyability.”
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain exams: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single exam," can be read in a thirty-page document on future conditions for admission to academic cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, stated that by significantly reducing the exams burden, we should be able to stop the mismatches, which significantly hindered the studyability.
Furthermore, “studyability” should be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if one cannot avoid the feeling of suffocation that one feels sometimes in choosing the courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the necessary margin of manoeuvre to enable and promote personal initiative."
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be “re-accredited” every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programs were not too loaded and the exam regime not too strict.
In some Länder, specialized universities and higher educational institutions have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhine-Palatinate is the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorielset programs to strengthen the teaching orientation offices as well as the examination offices and the International Relations Service
The Länder and universities have a budget of 10 million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
After that, you will only have to pass one exam to complete your studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, the recognition of grades from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and the access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the “studyability” of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were welcomed, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like the organization of educational policy to no longer take place in the future “behind closed doors” of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as interested persons should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Delegates Margret Wintermantel: "the student experience is very useful to us," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Union of Education and Sciences (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It claims the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW’s Board of Directors, also asks that the Länder ensure that today’s Bachelor students will have enough seats for Master’s studies tomorrow and as good study conditions as possible.
Countries need to hire more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not discuss the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a note on Herta Müller
It is with these words “Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...” that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he themes in bribes of troubling phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but lost at the same time his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later a collection director in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly sought-after Chair of Poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Artist House of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He spoke a lot about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his colleagues German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Recruitment trials had insidiously begun in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who has not been able to resist sufficiently the attempts to intimidate the Securitate.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary disruptions with the mechanisms of dictatorial power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and lowliness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only a guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate dossier, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to IM Walter's positive influence who had interceded in his favor.
“He could have pulled him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” said Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian intelligence services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Securitate spies, Herta Müller wrote in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and will sometimes have guessed which real names were hiding last borrowed names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been constantly countered and curtailed over the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS), but the restitution of the files has rather delayed since.
Since 2005 there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by the interview of a former Securitate official from Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed very contempt for the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inevitable issues are associated with the Söllner case as this happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the listeners, according to Söllner, gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller’s work, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, this is more than a note at the bottom of the page.
Clashes in the Champions League
There was the impression that a representative was arriving there, pulled straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sportswear manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight in a Mercedes C-Class, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, led himself into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and was not drunk of happiness either.
We had a nice evening, but we had to go back to work tomorrow.
Because it was now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland that we just engaged three days earlier were clear: “We have reached the eighth place in the final,” that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania “but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success.
The big job awaits us on Sunday.
There, it’s about repeating at Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that reappeared after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing to Destiny
The eighth Champions League final (match going 16/17 + 23/24 February / return match 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s fulminant entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had brought luck, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, an unmistakable motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the “soul plumber” – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so sad that it didn’t work with Mr. Babbel.
He triggered some magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "in football when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that you would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury break, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” seen by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the new boss’ method of work: “It’s someone who goes to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the direction, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart mostly needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad wake-up four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, said they had achieved one of the goals of the season, but they had others that were still far away.
We have not yet taken the difficult path.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn’t have the heart to celebrate, even after his first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann’s fierce criticism.
He accused the management of weak style and said it had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches had been removed from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt stressed and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life these two quadragenerals.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the group’s prior work by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combat performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in the success” replied Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man with the plastic bag applauded.
World Heavyweight Championships
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gestually provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the WBC version.
The judges unanimously decided on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a one-point victory of the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko has honored his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won the title of world champion twice from the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not reach the long-awaited goal.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional fights, has twice admitted his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th match.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mostly wanted to dictate the fight, from the height of its 2,02 meters, by his counter-left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller, who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's strikes, thus preventing Klitschko from putting his dangerous right-wing into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his strikes rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, to have crossed with Klitschko the distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko by describing him as a “wicked zombie” who “is not really capable.”
During Friday's weighing, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
It was the fourth win since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko is in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously given up without fighting.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the US.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having detronized the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, the Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled for September.
It seems that his promotion company is now considering playing this match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Affair
Frontal attack from the opposition: The leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz Affair.
The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Left (Die Linke) are asking the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately hiding some facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counterfeit" on the deadly strike of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
Clearly, this means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report at the disposal of NATO, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the lafrappe was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but rather to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the U.S. airstrike launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak before the federal parliament as soon as possible and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel should clearly say whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government if the chancellery, the military and the intelligence services have endorsed this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellor has in no way influenced the military intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasing voices expressing doubts about the true reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the tank trucks attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed some annoying details from the Minister.
The two senior officialsly informed the Defense Ministry of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" that Wichert had requested clarification of the facts in a letter.
So far, he has not received a response.
On Saturday, the ministry declined to comment on these allegations and referred it to the federal parliament’s investigation committee, which was to be formed on Wednesday, to bring light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the case of mentally ill people, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can unhinderedly indulge in the craziest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly gets the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not only appear in mentally ill people or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes causes the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, in the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earth's force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that make up it."
We are in the autumn of 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional with crying colors.
The earth's attraction has no power over him anymore, he flies to the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged, grimaceous devil creatures, their mouths bleeding, showing their teeth.
They pursue him, strike him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout his body.
Thunderstorming, ugly voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from his stereo chain, makes a loop of it and attachs it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a bucket and passes the loop around his neck.
He is jumping.
The circle breaks away.
Let it be a lesson for you, the voices in a choir shout out the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived through six acute psychoses, the last dating from 2 years, the first of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer distinguish between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under sensations.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centric, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the very center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime you experience a hallucination.
Unlike dreams, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experienced takes place in a real context.
Why our brains make these kinds of cabrioles is still a mystery for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that those affected have minor brain injuries.
It is assumed that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neural system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, however, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When the brain warms.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medications to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for a decade: last year he published his findings in a book titled “The Unreal World in Our Heads”.
Hallucinations are one of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain warms but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, love sorrows or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admitted to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16, she lives in a small town in the former Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
A woman who does everything normally.
Without the images and the voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, addresses him.
When she answers, her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears that boy.
They think that this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn’t dream, she’s sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
He can even notice his presence for a moment.
It is a pleasant feeling, she finds this young man sympathetic.
Are you crazy? she sometimes asks.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are generally scary.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, it happens that she can’t attend the class because the teacher is just introducing a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the table.
At night, the appearances are generally scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or dreams already, whether the images she sees, the grimaceous faces or the girl with bloody stitches on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Let me be quiet, she cried out to these creatures.
She didn’t tell her parents or friends about it, they thought she was crazy.
Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her backs last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I suppose that the brain is not busy enough, it makes sure that there is animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called daddy, since she was in thought age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain regions that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it’s very difficult for people like Sarah K to distinguish between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that are formed in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally differ from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too centered on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful illness that also contains something positive, creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a particular form of the alteration of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oneiroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the person who lives them and cannot distinguish them from dreams even when they are awake.
The onyroid state of consciousness manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies, as in patients with polyradiculopathy who fully consciously experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces that real situation that affects his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an ability to organize which is given to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a salvage of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his consciousness leaves for a several-day journey after surgery on a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is doomed to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from every room, visits strange places, travels in time.He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot in his bed watching his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based drugs.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcyclist who takes him back to his homeland, surfs with his hospital bed in the Alps' fog and meets a Korean mafia.
He completely absorbs himself into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys fundamentally differ from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of outer reality are even in a state of wakefulness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, “can cause a distortion of what we call reality.”
This is an experience that can also be enriching.
The first snow may fall.
Bordeaux
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly determined to integrate into society, Hubert Burda, 69, told Spiegel.
All details have been arranged in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also need to see if they are able to do so.
You cannot impose your children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-General Director in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he was in charge of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is at the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s nomination also serves as a link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always taken place in families who have let themselves be dragged by a bulimia of capital, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I have never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely don’t see myself in the role of preceptor of the country as Springer could be, and I don’t intend to be part of those international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Complete beauty
Everything you can want, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your disposal.
This is the goal of El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, laser hair removal specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d’Or, which has a gym, or L’Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a dining area, with a tea salon in particular, which offers more than 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relax area to organize your own “Beauty Party” with eight of your friends and relax through a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face, body care and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “coaches” that guide the customers’ footsteps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code onto a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us then how to perform our exercise program correctly.
His director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after working our body, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the motto of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10:00 to 22:00.
Varied departure
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, very important to highlight the figure, is one of the variables that we must consider.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona to build electric cars
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the City Council of Barcelona, has created the “Oficina LIVE”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The “Oficina LIVE” (Logistics for the Installation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and set up mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, submitting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinions and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa participates in regarding the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups across Europe and is undergoing a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the motor industry
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has said he sees a “future of tranquility” for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, constitutes the country’s main export sector.
In the presentation of the Government President’s Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites,” he said.
“Through this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can consider a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which constitutes our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), devoted €800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The chief executive explained that this investment is aimed at both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to the Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collector cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Collection Cars Show, a meeting place for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It has an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
You will not only find motorcycles and collector cars, but you will also find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine at ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist in Mercedes Benz.
External aptitude tests
But the trade activity of this trade fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Aptitude tests with car and collector motorcycles will also take place on an arranged circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated in the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, dubbed i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 2.0 150 horsepower petrol engine.
This second generation of the Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driver’s seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
Riding the wheel is also very pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This model is similar to the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overtake.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to this is a large box of regular forms.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre and 150 horsepower gasoline engine and with manual six-speed switching.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most sought-after Mazda3s are diesel models, those who do not run a large number of kilometers a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its great speed comfort and its controlled consumption.
As for the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the highest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipment, the RVM that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed regulator, photosensitive interior mirror, board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional € 1,500, includes, among other elements, adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behavior and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 150 horsepower petrol engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which ranges between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In exchange for this huge sum, the Mazda3 will give us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
The first luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have blended us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as usual, had chosen a dark “Lady.”
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility even to see certain kinds of attachments or to browse the Internet.
It its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
In truth, it’s harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
Taking into account its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of the monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a coffee shop on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult their mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing, and it should have been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated calls by the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside your home country, you hesitate to use the data, and you are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s still curious that it’s called Fon while it doesn’t have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals that allow them to profit their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other internet searches.
No subscription and no gallery.
It’s a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday for FonPeek: a buying option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone.
I want it simply because I think it’s a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle’s favorite color
Yellow is the first lady’s favorite color.
If she went to the presidency of Barack Obama in the United States with a dress and coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her in the second, undoubtedly the most important moment of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times, the suit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large brodery or necklace.
So that at first glance, it would seem that the First Lady of the United States follows the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to return the same clothes.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
If for taking office it was a thick toothbrush, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: from medium heels green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
Her hairstyle has also changed: her hair is now lifted while she wore it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed in the study “Fertility and professional careers of women in Spain”, conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional careers limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of a couple life and the number of children, whether the woman works or not, and the type of job occupied.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get into a couple earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, postpone getting into a couple life and their first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged 35-49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after they settled in a couple.This figure increases to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with a fixed job have needed more time in their lives to get a child, which has led them to push back on union and the arrival of children.
Moreover, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of life together,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that deepens the gap between women’s age of marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they get married and have their first child late.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged 35 to 49, those who had completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
There is also a difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is good.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, singing the universal motto “Because I’m worth it.”
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities registered with L’Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
For men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in Lost).
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its leading representatives, designers and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, were named Best Model of the Year.
The As of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do so according to the predictable and perceived genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the enlightenment core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not spare the fears or the illuminations.
A delightful pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to read and read.
I leave you a few moments here.
“In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same that I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that killed him.
About Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjugated the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven by the way of destruction.”
On James Joyce: “Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the northern side, on which the best climbers let go again and again.”
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer gathered the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this Munch character to bring his echo to the depths of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the escape of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the asticots.”
About Dorothy Parker: “One day she kneeled and prayed, “Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.”
On his tomb were engraved Spenser's verses: "Sleep after effort, / after the storm wear, / rest after the war, / after life, tired death delights."
About Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depression.
Her husband normally accepted that she told her that Edward VII was swinging him between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness.”
About Pío Baroja: “What did Martín-Santos do other than try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What did Benet try other than to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did He do except to aspire to the glory of this man, that he might serve as a pedestal for Him?”
A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a bloodmelon, rescued from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they struck him two beats that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don’t see how fun it is to attack free of charge a small defenseless animal that, in addition, was in the wild.
We must add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energizer who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The incident took place around 5 p.m., a Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog was gimmicking all day.
We, of course, filed a complaint at the police station in the neighborhood even though we doubt that it serves a lot, and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free who gives us affection, friendship and keeps us in company.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, combinations for helmet wear
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wear of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as the two structures said today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only element of protection that prevents head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products” and said it contributed to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new two-wheel helmet promotion campaign, under the motto “To be or not to be”, will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed to more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest spread.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the patronage union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, as the benchmark for the comparison, in November 2008, was poor, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, if we add all the vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of passenger cars, pick-up, van, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The big clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, though they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by the limitation of bank credits, other factors must be added, such as the rise in unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions.
In the face of this situation and unlike tourist vehicles, the subsidies for the purchase of the 2000E served little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle weighing less than 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, Ganvam was again reminded of the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers’ association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a decline in sales (tours and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency Braking Assistance is Now Mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a shortage period was fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The Emergency Braking Assist acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system through the driver’s kick.
But it doesn’t always hold the pressure to the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Assistance intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 pedestrian fatal accidents could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device puts maximum pressure on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to complete Opel’s rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been previously approved by the parties concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, has assured that a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian Converg group, is gaining importance.
In case there is no agreement with either of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab by the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it by just under 80 kilograms, leaving the weight at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to avoid, first of all, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilograms, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 more kilograms less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilograms, to reduce the gasoline tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilograms gained, to mount sports backets, another 12 kilograms, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilograms.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus gaining six more kilograms and replaced the handles of doors with handles of fabrics, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model also exists with the double-embray PDK, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual transmission model, mainly on mountainous roads in California’s secondary grid, with curved turns.
His behavior can only be called irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from riding on the ground with slump.
On the contrary: it was a long time since we tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in turns, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles at a low speed for the time necessary, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is accurate, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Engine of the will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that changes the engine rugging, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at stopping or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The coating of the roads we walked with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
Electronic assistants were barely present throughout the journey, while on some turns we found ice-glass in the early morning and gravelers later in the morning.
Ultimately, it’s an ultra-light car, one of the most fun to drive and that’s much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70 831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional star of the house's parades, the singer displays her face of bad girl with as much contentment as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or a “It Girl”, it’s a “Bag Girl.”
Baskonia offers victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the hard terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. She thus ranks at the top of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets at three points was the best of her team (29 rating).
Vitoria’s team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great dose of commitment and collective work, even though they had to wait until the end to win the victory.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter suggested that they had jumped on Israeli ground with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose Barac’s internal play and Eliyahu’s work, which was received with acclamations and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to get noticed as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter’s “minus six” rating already suggested that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right path to the pause, nothing was played, far from that, and the Avala team wanted to remind the team of Vitoria that it is not so easy to win on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow taking the advantage over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic’s players, injured but far from dead, needed to chain a few skillful actions to take the air, and it was at this moment that Mirza Teletovic’s machine gun appeared who, with three baskets of three points in a row and the help of English and Ribas brought the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Ava’s team went out to play the whole for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic’s players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroliga Group B, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor by the scale of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three points in a row, two from leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who struck the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the domestic game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team started operating by showing their superiority in both camps, while the outcome for injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Domestic players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, digged the 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
The Impossible Rise
The third period was offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even came to equal the difference from the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to chancelled.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-one minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible as the Olympiacos proved relentless when the players put pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of small real estate, job and vehicle ads in Spain.
The "How Much Should You Be Paid?" tool calculates users' salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
The search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels poorly paid,” Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the least well-paid.
A British computer programmer receives a gross annual salary of €45,226 and a French computer programmer, €31,059 while a Spanish computer programmer receives a gross annual salary of €24,000.
Similarly, a driver receives a gross annual income of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of a waitress, with 11,592 euros net annual, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the past three months are that of driver, part-time jobs and that of social worker.
Brazil sets deadline for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President must resign from the diplomatic position by 27 January 2010, the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refuge since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also cited the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the set deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 election (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile intended to impose on him by the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After rosy days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty emerges again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalised and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put a little sand in the roll, as the ECB has done with their awarding to a year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock volatility and corporate bond disparities are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected by it.
There is again a flight toward quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refugees chosen by investors, provoking an increase in differences between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain was barely hit by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a further revision to lower the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad for silencing the advocates of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among the leaders of global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, while what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the Emirates to restore its place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be completely irrational if the ECOFIN saved Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allowed a member of the eurozone to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, on the other hand, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitory risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our gap in public debt increases with European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences decreased and our differences continued to increase, it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasian risk.
The Standard & Poor’s case is an anecdote.When our forecasting indicators force most surveillance services to anticipate their recovery patterns and revise their 2011 forecasts upwards, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, there is little hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for now “prudence is the mother of certainty.”
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned in front of the subcommittee, in the eight-close.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this is not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion but 95 thousand.
In contrast, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue will change, and the power will need to be increased.
His stake focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with mechanisms for carbon recovery and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other “supporting energies.”
Galán, who believes the Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company claims, has not wanted to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging national coal consumption, which contradicts global warming policies.
According to him, there is a “clear long-term bet” in this regard, despite the “punctual” measures, as Iberdrola’s president called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Air Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the role of the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a term of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the center’s tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona launches its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy and water management company.
The construction site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway dealer.
The City Council hopes it will be available by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its English initials) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the auspices of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
In anticipation of the presentation of their offers in May next year, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately EUR 1,047 million) and in the final phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers, are facing each other.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in a smooth market, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
Against Acciona’s team is the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that passed the test was LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the share of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Welsh public works company, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major workshops and privatizations, but entering it is a big difficulty, unless it is through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Active Millionaires
Acciona focuses on a geographical area of great importance for the sector, in which it already has a broad presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and heads the grouping of companies responsible for erecting and managing the desalination plant in Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and leverage synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The subway, promoted by the City of Brisbane’s Bureau of Infrastructure and the Northern Link (northern link), is designed to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road in Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel, the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the procurement will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not planned that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two routes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers jobs at Hochtief
Australia continues to make much profit from Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will equip, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national fiber optic broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have fast internet access and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company ceded the construction project for the 27-storey King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC sells tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, for a sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being charged with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
Construction is scheduled to begin in 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore gets adjudicated Renfe’s advertisement
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
Ms. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that submitted to Renfe’s tender, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for limiting competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Telecom €63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to the institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts on its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivist.
A store of applications
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile telephony subsidiary followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has been a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have earned 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that have earned the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
In fact, the competition has distributed €5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the establishment of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this division.
The white club was the third on the continent to raise the most money for its participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country in terms of the money raised by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413,1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atletico Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million for being there, in addition to 550,000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who reach the eighth-finals each receive three million, the eight teams who reach the quarter-finals receive3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the winner will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million received by the other finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
At the same time, Barça earned 2.5 million dollars for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, which are allocated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four seats attracted.
The previous year’s champion gets 40% of the money assigned, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require a public offer (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be paid out over 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders 15 days to declare their interest in selling the securities.
The CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, SOS is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay away from possible buy-offs and prosecution of her former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged hijacking of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Furthermore, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new misappropriations of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the misappropriation of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion order submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina last October 9.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms matched current standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet presented “sufficient” following the changes applied on December 2.
The offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares were immobilized, and that they could in no way be transmitted before the finalization of the offer, of which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each accident is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex task.
Calculating the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
However, with the help of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Disaster assessment and maintenance service providers and solutions dedicate themselves to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of assessment tools and industry information generation are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that over the past five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very tough job, as each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be cataloged and its price recorded.
In addition, a “smart” graphic image of each model is created on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work can be done in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months.At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsche, for example, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and development work of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to give them different uses and offer different products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing broken parts or to calculate the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
Looking at the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the industry.
The company offers ten different tools, with the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of claims, intended for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the estimated repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint patterns.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of experiments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly chain, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open-ended server for the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wasted.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing common issues by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious accidents for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for accident assessment, failure or maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historic reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and it made a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it undertook its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group was listed at $1,000 million, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's index.
Online auction of accidental cars
In October last year, the Solera group acquired Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the industry, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are posted every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer move, but, on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collector cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Building a garage in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or discounts, and then print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be subject to credit.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner side.
