At the end of the exchange, the Prague stock exchange fell to the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange renewed with its fall of the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of the stock on Wall Street.
The market reaction to the result of the U.S. House of Representatives voting, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan of the U.S. financial sector, is also perceived in us.
Fall of stocks in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indicators succeeded, during the day, in deleting some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng Index lost four percent during exchanges, but later it deleted some of the losses and cut down to 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese stock exchanges in Hong Kong lost 3.8 percent, while markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent, but eventually it managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The doubts about the rescue action in the U.S. will influence the financial markets around the world,” observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the U.S. lawmakers should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected.
The Blood Bath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it had to dedicate up to $700 billion (approximately $12 billion).
The lawmakers rejected the call to support President George W. Bush’s project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. shares experienced a bloodshed on Monday and the main shares saw the greatest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost seven percent, having seen a fall of such a scale for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it turned out that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Cede: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion In Banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government agreed on a broader form of the U.S. financial system financial assistance agreement.
He will be submitted to vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turn in negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid of $700 billion (approximately $12 billion) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not certain.
In fact, before they can publish the final version of the law and submit it to vote, Congressmans must finish a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday at the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House’s banking and financial regulation committee.
According to sources, the plan should a priori be submitted to vote in the Senate as early as Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in rebuilding financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which aid to markets can be effective, there will be a "delusion."
The plan must be effective.
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent opinions regarding the form that the package of measures should have for market stabilization,” the Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg Agency.
The final vote could be held on Sunday.
In the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give the government a final form.
It should acquire from financial companies the inventable real estate assets that lead financial companies to considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to reach an agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson says.
A sign for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the falling stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator don't escape Harry Reid, the legislators make sure that Congress reaches a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus want to calm investors before the start of exchanges on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress' decision could influence Monday's exchanges.
But for the moment, it is impossible to clear with certainty when the two Chambers of the US Congress will proceed to the vote, nor if the negotiations are not at risk to remain blocked, at the last moment, by one or another problem.
The lawmakers hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still have many changes.
The total amount intended for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush desired, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, it has the possibility to block the grant of the remaining amount, following two steps: first $100 billion extra, then, to end, $350 billion.
President Obama welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress, he, has the possibility to put it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining funds for the purchase of bad real estate securities, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, wasined.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed to the vote of the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
The limitation of the golden parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contribuents against losses, the degradation agreement, the course of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and it establishes a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have trouble paying.
The government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing debtors’ monthly fees and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: A psychological aid
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we don't know what will be the mechanism and the price of the purchase of the problem assets.
This point will be decisive to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek said this week, to the server iHNed.cz.
If the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, it is, according to Marek, not so important as that.
“It is much more important that the congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time,” Marek emphasized.
A struggle pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobile.
We will advise you how to choose.
While almost all mobile phones can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clearly that it is better to buy only a phone.
There are many reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a expensive high-end gramofon to put Maxim Turbulenc’s new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on the vinyl disc, and from the point of view of quality there is no objective reason for this to happen.
But if there are on your roofs full vinyl discs, with rock, jazz or blues art, you’re at least likely dreaming of such a gramofon.
The same goes for music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty holding headsets purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
Here are two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also critical.
Some high-end music reader are able to do much more than a simple music reading, but it’s here unknown functions, of course, of most mobile phones.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and movies, to record these, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even serve for navigation.
And if you take into account the smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
But the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The greater the number of functions you use, the more the interval between two recharges will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy gains.
There are few mobile phones that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, consider that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you get to call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second recharger for work - this is true even for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players who are able, as a result of a recharge, to work continuously for at least 9 hours, including the less-performance.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially as not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
You can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the small dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for the readers, you do not need, except for the exception (iPod), any software.
You just need to fill, through the USB connector, the music device coming from the computer.
Most mobile and reader will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then according to the user’s judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, how to explore it from Windows, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile have more knowledge
When choosing a specific device, you are especially interested in the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of command.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you’re going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you’re enough any mobile reading the MP3.
Nowadays, almost all mobile phones are capable of this.
You are not even required to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
Everyone gets to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will arrive until you get just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), in turn, is less common.
High-end mobile devices also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason to acquire a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to fast-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether through GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
But it’s also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in plugins, which have almost all mobile phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price.
The cheapest is usually less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very convenient.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary headsets.
The price of the best phones and the best-equipped, also provided with an entrance for ordinary headsets, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
The reader, however, has the advantage of having a simple order.
Indeed everyone succeeds to ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily match the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramofon, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by an enormous data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a switchable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can get out even with 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, rather choose specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the control height is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones of the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the most further in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) greater, is provided by a MP3 player produced by one of the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have repeatedly mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, also confirmed it.
This is how, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming fees regulation, a paradoxical situation risks to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds the 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there was no more space for another operator, has chorous with the operators.
It’s probably true that a classic operator with his own network seems to have no longer a lot of chance (otherwise, now he would hardly find frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entrance of virtual operators to the mobile market that led to a considerable decline in prices, to which the traditional operators also had to respond.
Nevertheless, even before the entrance of trouble-festivities such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today at us were heard in the UK.
But it turned out that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We don’t have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to earn more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which possesses among others the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to operate efficiently, they actually need much less customers than a traditional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high cost of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers, in the UK, SMS at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, bet on an unusual target group can also be a good advertising.
In fact, this operator is specifically targeted to men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – a operator they like and they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It’s hard to say, if such a concept would be likely to work as well in us.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone’s spokesman, doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
Especially because it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services.”
In Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very promoting.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area,” said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not favorable to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would thus want to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not long hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
Sooner it will be the best.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we’ve managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl’s spokesman.
The future may be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
“At this point, we don’t expect there to be a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to others.
At the moment, no subject provided for a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz said.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not recorded for the moment a viable and bilateral profitable project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: “It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement right now.”
Instead, Vodafone focuses on the fulfilment of requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what, in our opinion, means the most contribution from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their profits.
What does it mean to make it easier for such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to agree as larrons at the exhibition. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies.
The biggest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, during the creation of the U:fon, was that exercised by the company T-Mobile.
This is testified by publicly accessible information drawn from the web pages of the ČTÚ.
But today, U:fon is ready to serve as an argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented on this: “The competition on the mobile market has, in addition, recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and above all his services, to high demands.”
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, has no power to intervene in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
The latter, in the face of this problem, adopted its typical position.
The entrance of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not a priori presented sufficient interest for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of Foreign Relations in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
But from the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and among other things also take care, that no one profits of his position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially as Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be found that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile telephone services."
But pressing towards a fair functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which arises from their reactions.
The question, whether this is really a coincidence, is naturally posed.
Similarly, a fuel price strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the coincidence and the hard fight of competition.
“The Office has not revealed signs of an anti-competitive behavior, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behavior on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even to the telecom regulator,” Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many disagreements.
Of course, there is a relevant market analysis developed by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: in order to create a virtual operator, it is necessary to obtain, at every time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
But even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators are apparently acting in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face, in negotiations with all operators, similar restrictions.
Getting the responsibility back on the ČTÚ is a fairly common tour in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not succeeded in making the newly adopted telecommunications law, an extension of ČTÚ’s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised a improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS need to know this very well, but their interests appear to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can go.
That is said, the operation of a kind of pseudo virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price list of mobile telephone services, but these are public only in part.
In most cases, it is about companies taking care of multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile services are thus offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The lists of prices of these companies usually reach only the elected.
The magic turn consists in the fact that the company makes in front of the operator figure of a classic business client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, it gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a re-sale.
"If what you are talking about occurred, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could lead to a cease-trafficking with the company in question," said Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity will not be achieved to the managers of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is opposed to such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these companies bring them unnecessary profits, and at the same time, in contrast to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: “Law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a significant percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not recorded under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the way of the ordinary customers of mobile operators.”
That’s exactly what should seem strange to the CBS.
In addition, another question is raised to the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to reveal such activity, and if it will not wish to satisfy the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we’re not the most expensive
As we have mentioned several times, the entrance of virtual operators to the mobile market has brought a considerable decline in service prices.
But in almost every country where virtual operators appeared, the traditional operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But it is precisely at this level that, in developed countries, the regulatory bodies have intervened, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue in the way a hot potato is removed by sending it to a nearby target.
Because of the experiences we have, we can’t get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable for them in these cases.
But don’t throw the hand after the cough.
If the background information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at us, the Czech mobile market may be moving back.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will hardly remain impassible to the rejection (to discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Citizenship, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national hymn Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choral interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously confessed to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
“From the beginning, I tried to take care that both singers, as well as the chorus, have a good diction, so that the words are well understood, that they sing simultaneously,” he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first heard in 1834 on the plaques of the Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously suited it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national hymn.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the Independent Czech Republic.
How the “new” hymn sounds
Prague Public Transportation (MHD) will introduce the chip in their ticket system on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1 October 2008 the first passengers will be registered in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will arrive in the metro, tram and bus, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
Currently, the latter is accessible to approximately a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30 day or 90 day coupon (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time make it registered on their chip card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coups via the internet on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can definitely forget the boxes in the metro stations, where they had so far to walk with impatience in long ribs in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon via the internet and it will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is available to passengers a container with a trained staff, which will help those interested with the online purchase and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compose the tickets and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
An automatic will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will be registered on the card itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
It is in the peripheral trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport from Prague), the controlers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the ticket control Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, who designs the times of the Prague public transport.
The peripheral buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but it is also necessary to place the Opencard in the indicated place on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
“In the event that the passenger would need to check the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peripheral buses and will not remember the date when the validity of their coupon expires, can again join the automatic distributors, originally used to record the coupon on the card.
Here, on the screen of the device, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudets call for a referendum in the United States
In 1945 the Sudanese Germans demanded that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This comes from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945 some group of Sudanese Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This arises, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov pray in the letter to the U.S. President not to allow "šumavská župa" (the forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have well understood the situation and we want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the U.S. troops come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” it is written in the letter, signed “People, to whom the fate of the Šumava lies in heart.”
Since the assembly in Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising – knowing the Czech national character – only of brutality, of regardless attitude, of incomprehension, of oppression and of servitude, the authors of the letter ask the U.S. President to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We can't believe, that you would give this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has not contributed in any way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter writes.
The alleged reason why the authors can’t sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the “Czech oppressors”.
If the President of the United States doubts about the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or whether to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Sudet Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would be raised, very few of them admitted that possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would get for the Sudets a certain type of autonomy.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be profitable to them,” Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed, according to him, that, following the Beneš decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You don’t think – you pay.
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
This is the most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of the minister Aleš Řebíček believes it will discourage drivers from a dangerous behavior on the wheel.
This $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on tracks.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol at driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It mainly wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
You don’t think – you pay.
The phrase "You don't think" is inserted in majuscules on the registration board.
Then, in a blade of blood, there is the phrase "You will pay."
This must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of negligence.
The spots will "hunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the number of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The Strategy of Sugar and Frog Against Drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and shell system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The threat is the threat of a penalty or accident.
The risks must be remembered to the drivers," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
Signals that signal the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
“When a static signal that warns of a danger is installed, it will likely quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it,” Kořán said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli provisional government, voted for the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all territories (occupied), or even all,” Olmert said.
“We will retain a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians an analogous percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not be made,” he added.
He admitted that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
“He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not desire that tractors and bulldozers break his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert noted referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, when several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountains, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he submitted later.
Retirement from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel’s retirement from the Golan heights, which he said is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some efforts from Damascus.
“I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retirement,” he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relations with Hezbollah; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to terrorism by Hamas (Shia movement), Al-Qaeda (terrorist network), as well as the jihad (high war) in Iraq,” he said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is prohibited
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can during the journey move inside the bus.
"If we wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The incident, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus road.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the vehicle’s most dangerous seat, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
But the bus can have an accident, or even brake suddenly, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is in accordance with its technical list equipped with standing places or not.
If this standing seat equipment is not approved, passengers must stay sitting.
The long-distance Student Agency buses have no standing places; this was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the company director Radim Jančura.
“This is a matter that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilets during the trip provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no univocal legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription takes care of this role.
On the other hand, no legal prescription does not prohibit the carrier from offering services either.
The road transport law only knows the term vehicle recipient; it does not define its rights and duties," said spokesman Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law addresses the problem sufficiently.
“All depends on whether the bus has in its approval the permission to offer standing places.
Everything lies in it,” he says.
The buses are divided into urban places, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, interurban places with standing places and a higher permitted speed and in long distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belt.
As in the aircraft, an expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) in Transportation Safety, does not see the shipping of stewards on board as a major problem.
"With regular traffic, there is no danger. the situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Neither, it’s uncertain when turbulence will happen and the air host can kick the head.”
“But if the bus would have stopped suddenly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
The same way as in a city bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal requirements," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier offering stewards services.
He employs two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a risky profession.
However, as soon as I get the impression that it is a risky business, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and journal on board.
This will also reduce the costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason that gives to the absence of stewards in its vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, who provides, compared to SA, a very small number of lines.
“We don’t have any hosts, we’re opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a deadly accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has happened.
A young host from the Plzeň region, who worked for the company for two years, died in the crash on the Naples line.
A Slovene truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flash and it blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it through a sudden maneuver, but he broke it by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl’s family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also count on the guilty.
A change to the law?
Not in sight
A amendment to the law, which is being drawn up, for more than a year, by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could bring details about the shifts of the stewards on board the bus.
“But it has not reached any conclusion on this issue.
Indeed, she is not too interested in the buses, but rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile on the wheel,” says the expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards as something that would fundamentally put the safety of passengers in danger,” said spokesman Hanzelka, pointing out that the safety control of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The big words were not missing in the letter sent by the WestLB Board to the house employees.
From an union of entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, “the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse financial group” could be formed, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a “competence block” doubled of sustainable productivity in such a case.
Overall, such a relationship could be the decisive push to other concentrations in the country’s banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a management committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always undergoing a strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority that has, only recently, made clear to the Government of Northern Westphalia Land that time was counted in search of a future solution.
However, it’s been a question for a while already – also from the Frankfurt side – of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse from through their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Certainly Deta-Bank chief Franz Waas said during the presentation of the figures of the semester in late August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by both the Länder banks and the savings groupings, commissioned the Board to conduct negotiations with the WestLB for common business activities.
It could then be the debt of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the negotiations have just begun, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important employers on the Frankfurt Financial Square, enters the game when it comes to consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhine Palatinat and Halbab.
Nothing has come out of this bullshit.
Just the plans had been made public that the Land of Hesse government spoke against any participation of Hellaba in them.
The other two houses did not join.
The Land Bank of Rhénanie Palatinat was linked in place to the Land Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there has always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
In the last place, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Board of Directors of Hellaba, was opposed to any trade strategy of merger with its bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the aggregation of the different institutions of the public sector is urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Land Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg could be realised first.
For Helaba, this is not a good news.
If the pressure for new fusion should rise, the potential partners gradually escape it.
In the South, she will now be a junior partner, although she has so far better resisted the crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba’s capital, on the contrary, launched a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
The NordLB will remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflection, however, reflects only one of the facets.
Another aspect poses the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be sorted.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, i.e. through which trade model the future capacity of the countries’ banks should be secured, had not so far been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfers.
In the end, a breakdown of the WestLb could take place, breakdown that here is obviously not desired.
This is also what is discussed in the letter of the current Board of Directors: in any case, a ‘global solution’ for the institution would be aimed at.
How all this will be placed in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to see.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and therefore nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre beer ton of the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built barbe that shows about 200 beer party visitors what profound sounds their puppy can produce.
Elena first tape Luca and then kisses her.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the road station near the Puorta nova station, four buses take the departure this evening at 23h45, 'destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel Brazilians exclusively.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing out and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noise, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long duplicated coat of false skin and glasses with wide silver montures.
For the past five years, they have gone to the beer festival, already three dismissed nothing but this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 22:30.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, boiled in accordance with the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There is no beer yet.
Soon, everything gets calm in the bus, the passengers sleep.
It’s better, they’ll still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration sheets do once more a break shortly before Munich, on highway 8.
When in the morning, the Marco group finally arrives at 6:30 as planned on the parking near the Theres Square, 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, make your hair with the small yellow hat.
On it is written on the left 'Beer' in Gothic, and next to the web address of the travel agency of Marco 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: ‘When the doors of the beer chapter open, we run,’ Marco screams in the morning.
‘Run!’ Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
‘Not in front, otherwise we are blocked, and not all the yellow helmets on the same banks, they must be distributed in the room!’
The chop, Marco screams, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the instructions!
Show the security officers that we behave well.
As soon as you leave your places, they are gone.”
Third: ‘Today evening, to be back here at ten and a half pile!’
After that, we went to the beer party.
On the way, someone takes the yellow helmets to the trees to find the way, to the panels and even to a electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the ‘weekend of the Italians’.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who go through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come intentionally from Italy this weekend.
Munich police is strengthened by seven police officers in South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with 200 medical interventions.
The one that is appreciated by the Italians is the Hofbräu brewery tent.
Insomnia nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word ‘relatively’ and that he slept that the German banking sector would not be saved by the crisis movements.
This actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate finance Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside the DAX, gets a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from turbulences in the markets.
A person confident in the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are issued up to an amount of €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it is Depfa’s daughter company that suits the losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced very short-term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since due to the unreliance to the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the net capital rate also had slightly decreased from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, the profits from the allocation of determined debts and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions fell from more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interests according to the Book of Tax Procedures and Commercial Purchases for Konzern companies that the profit deficit of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state finance had first badly speculated on industrial real estate loans, which were then affiliated with the Aareal bank.
Because the traditional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa was then more engaged in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must carry out amortisations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group’s profits and losses that remains yet quite unclean.
The dividends were amputed.
In 2007, they were divided into two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has, since Depfa’s acquisition, been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions on the interbank market as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks again significantly decreased, since the banks accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a portion – approximately 50 billion euros – of the Depfa’s total credits of a short-term refinancing medium.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the international financial markets largely out of operation currently.
Other sources say refinancing would be secured through the funds by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of HRE’s Board of Directors, explained that Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to use financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are based on the principle that Hypo Real Group’s market capacity is now secured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect it.
However, having regard to the dynamic and immutability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unimaginable that the funding should not be used in its entirety.
The opposite cannot be excluded either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest communications, still at the doors of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this at least temporary rescue will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The price of the stock dropped from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The rates of obligations, on the other hand, are good.
While the debt to the first head has barely moved, the second-level loans rates flush.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and those of course that have a lifetime beyond 2009.
Hypo Real Estate’s bonds previously seemed to be an alternative speculation placement, now their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net aggravation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that made the crisis enter the establishment by the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as emission institutions, governments, and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, we can assume a resorption of the remnants over time.
Or it will happen what no one dare to expect at this time – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached security has now become a simple founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia first and foremost to long-term creditors on the decision to know if they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a trace to constitute a delay of losses for the next years on the next capital income tax on stock gains automatically taken.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to show up for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited.
When I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train for 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t lose myself.
The start of the courses doesn’t seem to be fixed as strictly as we are in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after another from eight hours, until at nine hours less than twenty, a table round begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course began, it was up to me to present.
I don’t like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put a old mother’s jacket, as well as a shirt, blue climbing socks and black leather shoes.
In this dress so I presented myself before the pupitre, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low messes, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew him through my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of the Japanese ados and means "sweet, cool".
Then I quickly moved to my place.
The girl next to me made me a great ironic smile, she found that it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone spoke to who better, could laugh and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all went out of their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it’s really something different than the miserable German case.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sauces, a corn and algas salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is sure is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salty prunes confites, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and that is then prepared carefully - in the hope of being able to make a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I wonder if I could see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to spend a year in school in Tokyo.
I always answered:
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, reading mangas is what I have preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture that is there, at a time, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weak one for traditions, usages and customs.
And here they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
The rats also have sensations.
A mouse or a coward escapes from the danger, does that mean that he also feels fear?
Neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have sensations.
But how can we check that he feels the same when he behaves the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without that I or anyone else has so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we penetrate into hardly practicable fields because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is faced with a danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, escapes or attacks.
Human beings behave the same way, so some scientists draw a comparable subjective experience from it.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our experience subjective to that of animals difficult.
One of the aspects is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the direction and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed among humans than among other primates and appears to be completely absent among other beings.
At least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could be in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence is linked to the language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if the consciousness should not depend on the language, it would surely influence it, so that the animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our state of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internally and subjectively, is not allowed to be measured or, due to this particular Hardware, to be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation creates big problems to us.
Most of my developments are referring to the content of the conscious experience, but there is next to another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that’s exactly what happened during short-term primate memory studies, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does it mean to the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as the fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its followings, such as the reactions of the body) captures the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize the primates and especially the Man.
The subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, are releasing, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others than to ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that the sensations from primitive activities arise in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brain throne, just like Jaak Pankseep who, however, focuses more on the brain throne.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could have fully participated in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can’t contradict it, but I think it is indemostable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is probably the same feeling in both cases: how can we yet check if rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A coward escapes from the danger, but if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove the same experiences.
Certainly, the nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cowboys don’t even have a brain.
But is the brain throne the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this to man: how could we prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, even cowboys (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don’t know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is nervous insofar as the same thing is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
This could be considered short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly cling to a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotional person.
UEFA President Platini: Thanksgiving for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships,” Wasjunik said.
But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the calendar of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at the maximum speed,” Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis said.
“UEFA is constantly looking at us.”
A more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent manager.
The meeting was held at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There would be a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP said.
"We have insisted in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several members of the Premier League were, already in the previous season, convicted of compulsory relegation manipulation; in the end, the beginning of the League has even had to be discarded at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid is indigned
She wanted to promote for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her former adulter Dennis Quaid.
He scumps – and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - to the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have learned about the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be “Monstruous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, that “Meg again removes the story of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be more “regretable” that “the punishment and disturbances that a divorce involves for each child be revived in public” for their 16-year-old common son Jack.”
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has married again and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his answer to the shock: “In any case, my life continues.
I am happy to have a wonderful family that goes well.”
Price of air tickets and hotels falls
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be profitable again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and found, after a price rise in the first quarter, a net profit decline in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, hotel nights have already decreased in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 examined European cities with an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 examined European cities.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear mainly in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a “low-demand travel of American tourists.”
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are holding a 26.3 percent rise, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economic-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-course flights, very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economic-class bill prices fell on average 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, business-class and first-class however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have experienced an even greater decline than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this price decline would be, on the one hand, a flushing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand would cut off the ground in many segments of the airline travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure from the competition by the “Open Sky” treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the stressed situation is the airline’s elimination of non-profit flights, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 – they were 24 airlines only in Europe.
HSV vs Gladbach 1:0
With a single goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has not yet managed to find an eleven functional.
De Kristoffer Klein. Aggrandir. landing in disaster for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player came back late in the game and his lifted shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he was out of his lips persuasively.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need this second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the clothing hall of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn’t much happening in the clothes, the half-time was over and most of them were sitting in their place.
Rieger has been the Physiotherapist of HSV for three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at the strategic places.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol accepted and lifted his finger to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s chief coach Martin Jol.
Which orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The implementation was missing.
“It wasn’t all very nice to see today,” later said Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard would have "wished to be more relaxed as well."
This 1:0 (1:0 in the midtime), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head hit by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Even Saturday afternoon, fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the temporary ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It will be a birthday without a celebration.
“We know how to get back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubted that the average result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivers – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern – forms slowly, but it doesn’t shine yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
In Wall Street, the fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones temporarily to fall by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in history.
The Dow Jones is a little down.
Around 20:30, the world’s largest stock index was 10,579 points with a decrease of much five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange index was at 1548 points with a fall of more than seven points.
The most losers in Dow Jones were at that date American Express which lost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any profits.
Goldman Sachs’ shares declined by 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid in one time, but gradually.
In return, the state should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in relation to the change of the price in order to reduce the burden for the Public Treasury.
The course of actions aspired in the turbulence in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not relieve the concerns of investors.
The stock rate of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index collapsed despite the government's expected financial market rescue.
Spectacular falls in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of the Bavarian real estate finance has lost at the moment three-quarters of its value despite the federal government and private banks' rescue operation, the Commerzbank accused of a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slept below the significant psychological bar of 6000 points and faced at 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent deficit.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s heavy $700 billion rescue plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States was planning to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index accused a drop for the moment of 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743.61 points after a rise starting from 1.26 percent.

The multinational trade and tourism company has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences space spacecraft flight
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves the researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of spacecrafts during what is called gravitational support maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Due to fuel conductions soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused discomfort among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a maneuver of the spacecraft, through which they obtain an additional boost in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example, Earth.
Thus, the sondes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what surprises the researchers over the years: flying objects do not always behave at 100% the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Furthermore, irregularities occur in the speed level.
The probe becomes unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicians could not explain this effect.
They baptized it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curve of space, may not be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein didn’t mistake and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“The black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, a matter that is also near Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only known the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It appears to come out of it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other heavenly bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six prisoners were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Rescue negotiations are already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was by Egyptian state television, Arab television channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well and safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert should already be on the way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclean: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to put an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without screaming station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the agent said.
It was only to gather the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the rabbits on Sunday in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a rescue of €6 million from Germany; the money was to be delivered by the German woman of one of the kidnappers.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their security.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
Men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the story.
Abuse of a brother who led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse inflicted by her grandfather led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from the Stitians in Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after he admitted eight heads of charges for ways of unrighteous facts.
The high court in Truro said he was regularly linking his sister, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, 34 years old, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached and banded her before forcing her to sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
His grandmother went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a National Trust volunteer assistant, was hunted by abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, appeared since 2006 "emotionally dead" and "he had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter who had, in other words, written a letter of confession that ended as follows: "I attached her and banded her regularly."
“I have not sexually abused her.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: “You’re really strange as a fetishist, your victim should be scared, especially at the age of 7 years.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And even more surprising is the fact that if she had not committed that gesture, her story’t ever end at the court.”
He added: “I emphasize in particular, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your commit crime for years on Stephanie.
“Without them, she would be a happy, promising and successful young woman today.”
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, BBC.
The Minister of Defense was on a journey when he forgot two high-class documents, on a train toward Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intention.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Office Cabinet," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed, is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause that deals with the backup of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services.
The documents he lost contained assessments about Al-Qaeda and security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Companies of the building face to the B&B invoice.
The British building companies may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the Bradford & Bingley bank's rescue.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savings of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from the savings, including 59 building companies.
Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it’s “irritant” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be refunded when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interests that will at the same time increase will be debited, each year, to 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It’s annoying to see that the institutions that had a prudent behavior... now have to pay some of the institutions’ bills that were much less prudent.
by Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the loan interest will rise in 2009 to £450 million.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the chief executive of the Commercial Committee of the Building Companies, told BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It’s “irritant” to see that the institutions that had a prudent behavior during the recovery of the real estate market, now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first annals.
“We have to examine all aspects of this case over the coming weeks, to evaluate the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salt invoice,” Cole said.
The interest rates for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest rates will be paid throughout the year, which could also double.
Since building companies are organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
The milk increases up to five penny per liter.
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny per liter, from Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two penny increase in February, and occurs after a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they go on their turn, raise the price to consumers.
Before the February rise, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last varied in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Rejected Guarantee
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a warranty request to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who risks being arrested when he returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to grant her caution because of her investigation for having extorced a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000,00) when she was PM.
This is one of the many accusations that are addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, the forever rival of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed under guarantee earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government first gives him full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they don’t see why she could not remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request saying it does not require guarantee since she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
“We will appeal against the Supreme Court order.”
Her lawyers argued that she needed this guarantee to return to the country in order to prepare for elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to be treated abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations they are subject to.
We are concerned about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, 200,000 children missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to the violence linked to the Taliban, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations launched a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she says she failed to contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A spokesman for the UN said this happened despite the Taliban’s promises not to attack or block thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV judiciary battle
BSkyB lost its trial after the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission said that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement aiming actually to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau that the acquisition by BSkyB, ITV shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator of Ofcom were all against this purchase.
BSkyB reiterated that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, it was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
A new investigation in the case of the US prosecutors.
The U.S. general lawyer has appointed a special accused to investigate the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
It all came from the case report by the General Inspector of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to White House officials, legislators and former Prosecutor-General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political reasons.
The Special Attorney, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the officers interrogated during the investigation, lie to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
“These serious accusations of potentially criminal, unfounded behavior have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” General Inspector, Glenn Fine, said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had said that the prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which encouraged some observers to attribute to these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Congress Republicans, while others would have refused to investigate fraudulent voting accusations against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting judicial bodies for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, ends accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical to Mr. Gonzales’ role in this case, stating that he considered him “first responsible” for these dismissals, and ends with “abdicating” his role as leader,” remarkably succeeding not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epope will be honored.
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get that recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is going out of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, ranking on the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell has remained in English rankings for nine years, and has been sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered a health problem in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his a heartbeat becoming irregular, after he collapsed on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal cord.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, bulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others merely functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-term local residents don’t know how to give instructions to go to Extra Place because they’ve never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs the north of First Street—not to confuse with Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 feet long, it looks like a dustway rather than an active artery.
No signals indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to replace Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the past house.
But the City Department of Conservation and Real Estate Development, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owners committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal allowing the real estate maker to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the committee number 3.
"There's only a few spaces left to belong to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
“They could propose to restore and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to restore the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a cafe to which the manufacturer will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner of it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned walk, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Property Conservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing in addition that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colourful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a light historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has this name since 1802, when the heritage of the great farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving off that small piece of land, which remains since abandoned.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, re-opened at Extra Place; the street is more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of barracks, hills, barracks, posters, leaves and cords.”
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution to the luxury East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity – a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be fitted in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow, dark day and night, and delimited by the doors of a roasted iron warehouse and persian, full of past week newspapers that fly along the goats."
With little exceptions, the street always has the same look.
A rat runs agile at the bottom of the street, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which is now the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 ounces empty beer, leaves next to newspapers that have just been thrown.
Some passengers said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its emphasis.
Mr. Field, on his side, said he thought that some underestimated the street’s attraction in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have occurred in dark, humid and disgusting places.”
The bilingual debate: immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate’s position regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former member of California Studies, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you think.
Attracting the favor of Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign emphasizes that “African and Latin students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To fight these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program supports among so many other topics, “two-language transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that comes up for Obama is whether his desire to bilingual education that defends class education in other languages than English goes beyond his interest to eliminate the differences.
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of Los Angeles.
The students of this school are largely Spanish, and low-income.
More than one-third of students, consisting of many new arrived, study English.
Among the CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state math exam, expert level.
Similarly, 93% of students passed the English-language-art exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that of Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street puts on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities as well as an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here’s an example Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of the Sixth Street, this school has set up the English language instruction “full immersion”.
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me, “We had a huge success with a student who just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without her class, you’t have had any chance to identify him.”
“It works,” she says, “it worked for us.”
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in the other schools consisting mostly of Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the forecast of Mr. Obama’s response.
Although it is favorable to the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this question as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop polling on the literacy of the laws in English.
Instead, he said, “You must make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the educational models that work, rather than deceive them or consider them insignificant.
Oil Reduction Following World Economic Worries
Oil prices dropped significantly on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan in favour of financial steps will fail to restore life to the economy.
The long-term transactions of crude oil fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.The New York Mercantile Exchange, during the sales this morning.
The prices have fallen more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, the raw materials markets have been shocked by Wall Street’s financial agitation, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in light of the deep uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the biggest rescue plan agreement in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be durable.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital’s analysts said this week’s narrow negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, “particularly have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
“The prospective of global fairness, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this infection.
“As for raw materials, our most urgent concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and especially in China.”
The bank’s analysts lowered their expectations for the next year, given the crashes in oil consumption due to the slowing economic growth, so they were forced to drop by 20 percent, the oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Second Time Day is a decisive day for the team's record improvement.
After spending over these last eight seasons, more time than anyone else in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned 0 to 0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had saltly played under dark clouds.
Then the back quarter Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precurator of one afternoon during which their relationship made a jump forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half-time.
“I’m not out of my area,” Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
“He’s a poor player.”
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing the catch, the defence defeated the Cardinals quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens left the ball out because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball could be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of this possession in the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking a advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that Jets had been able to score in a time.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said “the second time or the third?”
When he was told the two – the Jets left 21 indisputable points in the third time – Mangini said: “I can tell you that I liked the second time more than the third time.
“Many points have been marked in a short time.”
Gibraltar, overcome its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, again proved to be worthy of his title of the best runner of the century, after battling his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03.59 victory in an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record in his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing—can be exaggerated to the eyes of today—that air pollution does not increase her asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decrease of the marathon record for more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he suffered cramps two weeks earlier, and failed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rough.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I got there last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best.”
He was accused – especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia – of having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world marathon stars, actually relying on the leaves as if they were in a track competition, and considering more the world records than the sense of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s capabilities as a background rider.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenian elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the line heads had disappeared.
A little more than three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made its final rise to break from Kwambai, which ended second in 2:05:36, improving its best personal five-minute record.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promises to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenian runners take a great advantage, then exceeding them about 18 miles and a half afterwards.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ended third at 2:25:01.
In a City at Part, the Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunshine, brilliant and giant Orlando, it is a small quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood house, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to do today."The city on five lakes, three short croquet, 300 dark leather, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
It has become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee come to the Zora Festival which takes place every year in Eatonville, to tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was already in the 1930s when Hurston told that the black rural population of Florida was often refusing to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, doesn't know what he loses."
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has in addition invoked an open dialogue on the topic of race, many here remain cautious from the sight of the foreign.
“We’re very cautious about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, ever resident and the oldest parish woman in the city.
“It must be in accordance with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historic model of a black rule and a community of 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture – sometimes dedained, sometimes acclamated – which reminds the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her native city to the whole world through sincere, full of dialect books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just at the outlet of Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in a chapter of dark history and human drama.
Courageous as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
“passed the road on the left,” she writes, “you’ll find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and those well-conserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds as well as everything that can serve passers.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with analphabetization, re-marriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not that way.
It was not a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well,” said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson’s young girls that Hurston immortalized, quoting the uncolored songs, played by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
We always remember Hurston as a living and excentric person, who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in the city without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wearing pants here, where even today we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many laughed on her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he also adds, balancing in his chair from the latter patio that leads to Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was baptized, that “this never stayed too long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College of the 20s, she was buried in any tomb, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, nor a plate for the general public.
I don’t think they’ve understood the contribution or heritage she offers to the world,” said Valérie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows”, a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Officials of Orange County wanted to pass a five-way highway across the city, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way street of the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville just removed from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute about the mix of races led hatred to the gates of the community.
“At that time, a band of white young people came to throw orange or objects against those sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
“A woman has died.”
They threw a cake out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education “insulting rather than glorifying of my race.”
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, diluted Eatonville’s cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
“The black children used to be kissed – I remember it – we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as Chief Director of the Guard of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students were no longer coming from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s here a line of cultural demarcation,” said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, in addition, have allowed to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as she, armed with a joyful self-confidence and behavior lines such as: “How can they get rid of the pleasure of my company!”
It exceeds me.”
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous Hurston tomb and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston directed by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best-seller, reintroduced it to American canons.
The project of the highway arrived just at the time the most famous girl of Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston see her as a savior.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this highway would generate.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the story rejected the proposal of the highway.
“The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride,” said Melle.
Melle Boyd summarized the whole stating that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-resident people, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who visits our church since 1993, began to come in a large number, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (obviously named Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaid.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself as a back street in a summer rain day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today there are 90 percent of black people)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You must seek permission for most interviews, and some things—such as the walls of the violent church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a courageous teacher and who has a weak for the bright red, are always afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his whole race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, foolish, crazy and mixed than the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is from the sincere civic affection that we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's uncle, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the correct description of Eatonville.
“Most people, who go through this area there, will think, ‘oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’ Alondra Kenon said after the mess last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were staying away from the kiosks and giant TV screens at Times Square, they’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and beekeeping offices above their head, bankers and cover fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "working day at the office" since the 1929 crack.
Delivery continues to flock on the trottoirs, with their wagons and their muffins plates for morning meetings.
The Latinos are always tracing among the residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxury shirts hanged on a yog disposed on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the tail to buy their morning sandwich from ambulant merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16:00 and 19:00 a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately I had planned to work late afternoon because I discovered at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people making the tail.
Not in front of the cash boxes, nor to withdraw from the item or make a payment, but in front of the customer service boxes, where ordinary customers ordered their checks, tourists asked for the direction for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those before me, I’d later learn from Starr, my “personal authorized banker,” all made the hole for the same reason as me.
Not the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from the savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and who say to treat customers as their family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, a $327-capital bank, Washington Mutual, has recourse to the bankruptcy syndic, and while the New Yorkers were coming home for the week end this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with a $440-million-saving account, desperately sought a buyer to save it.
The office and the shop employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential breakdown, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, or the one that makes the most of the rescue in Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in the past few weeks.
“I heard a lady in my local Chinese supermarket, talking at the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and her weak CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the monetary funds market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take a risk.”
Muslim tombs profanated while Austria oscillated to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road panels illustrating red-rayed mosques.
Police accuse extreme-right extremists of scattering an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the week end of the extreme-right political parties' victory in the country's general elections.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is, according to the police, an organized action.
The criminals painted on several tombs Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives think that this could have been done to disguise the feeling of hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
This incident could somehow be linked to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islamic community said he was "deep shocked" by the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that reaches its end.
Austria seriously thinks of regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that rejected 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to the critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the wear of fool and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out just after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The court has banned the glamour rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed Glitter a six-month ban after he expressed to the authorities that have him under control his intention to go to Spain through France.
The police in Kent had granted this travel ban last Thursday after proofing to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse on children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said: "On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford court, the Kent police requested an application to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd was not there.”
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be recorded in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could punish up to five years in prison.
Kent police said it would not discuss any particular cases or potential movements of Glitter in the story.
A spokesman for Kent Police said, “Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children like those from abroad.
“We think it’s easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks in a much more efficient way.
“Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention to the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks for the public.”
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having cleaned 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, respectively, 10 and 11 years old.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he had to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel good, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from checking his passports, and he eventually left to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him to enter their territory, and therefore he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he should return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and, he stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court of limited jurisdiction in Uxbridge, West London, for registered in the list of people accused of sexual abuse, as it demands Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to a four-month fine in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was confident and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
“I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character” – Günther Bauer
Neither clothes nor strange clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to get the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other, the person.
Unseparable except in the intimacy, in those unknown moments of the general public, where you discover in intimate gestures and stolen sights of artists who do not worry about climbing on stage.
German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatrality of a few performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of the flamenco in different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition “reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day,” explains the creator, who clarifies that “Flamenco – people” “can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a character.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars.”
With the "People's Song of the Mines" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and equipment, reminds the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for the essence and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days here in the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has turned into anthology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exhibited in the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he likes to photograph the portrait of people, know them and be able to enter into their lives for a more or less long moment.
I think in photography the portrait is the hardest genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that you sometimes don’t know or who leave you just a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I’m always trying to make my ideas reality.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of the Mata Street (road parallel to the Hercules Peopleraie) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa acknowledges that the novel he writes is "truly brave"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is very determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize for Literature favourite confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that now occupies him "is a real courage" and that "all demonstrates that he should not write it."
"If I were reasonable, I't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people surf in the aqueduc city.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize at the majority of the votes of the participants, made full room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The festival presentator, Félix Romeo, met in front of a fascinated audience who didn’t see the time passed during which Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to “his thirst to read” and “to live new experiences”; how he wrote in a “very methodical way” through an intense work of documentation, by correcting and re-writing a part of the text to face his “feat of inspiration”; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there's no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an efemer experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it has "effects" and "will make people less similar," because the writers were asked "to not let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather ruins Pozoblanco Fair
The flag party that concluded the bear races at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toréadors checked that the arena was impraticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bear race.
The bad weather worsened at this exhibition, since finally two out of three parties couldn’t take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second tower race planned.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face in the Castilblanco arena.
So only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was brought to triumph, after making arms movements face to the bear with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the turtle and a cut ear that the found stairs applauded more than his battle in himself with the turtle.
Even worse for El Juli, who has entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain and glory.
During his struggle with the second bear, after a clearly better struggle, he was caught by the majority of the audience.
Police inspection of a firewall in the province of Alava: two thousand kilograms of hachish found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police arrest two occupants of a firewall and the latter two take the flight.
Their load, more than two tons of hachish, of which to stop them.
Police persecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Basque Government’s Interior.
The person was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alabama Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Armiñón Municipality.
They were preparing to stop a firewall to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
Police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further on the bottom coast, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooden area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and captured the 2,178 kilograms of hachish they carried and they found after inspecting the firewall, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hachish ballots. Then they moved it to a police station for a comprehensive inspection and to weigh the drug.
Furthermore, officials found that the registration sheet had been “falsified” since it did not match the one written on the gray card of the firewall, it was also why they attributed the detainee a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug captured.
The prisoner, A. A. J. of 28 years old, has been warned to carry out the different steps and will be judged within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her doing strange maneuveres trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for California police patrols revealed to the journal People.
The witness stated that around 16:30 Locklear “foundly pushed the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she runned on her sun glasses.”
Shortly after, the witness, who in the beginning had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and came out of his vehicle.
That person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observations of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 19:00 and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nerve depression.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to take responsibility in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of former youth and sports counselor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out treatments in favour of members of his family.
"In those cases, I am very federal, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take on its responsibilities," Llamazares said as regards the political party's behavior that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked the investigations to prove "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict ethical codes for all officials.”
“Mayo’s Blood” by Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recorded the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Blood of Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to put the many characters on stage and to illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in the head of the long list of actors.
The film, which lasts more than two and a half hours, "May's Blood" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Grand admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci assures that he has realized with this filming "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him, three years ago, to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2 May Madrid, something he always accepted when the story stood up to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that mistaken head for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under Ferdinand VII's rule," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having received such a funding as for the films "Captain Alatrist" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice the one obtained for "Mayo's Blood" - because he couldn't film some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the filming and whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" and considers that "the filmmaker's role is to go to the theater and the cinema to stay informed."
Many actors in "May's Blood" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy," Blood of Mayo," Seven French billard tables" and finally the winner," The Blind Turnsols," are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a prize.
“At first you think you’re working for succession, then you realize that you’re working only for prosperity, and now you’re pleased to make a more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets in the skin of Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will give tribute to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), is born in the Triana neighborhood and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting, pioneering life of women’s liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and applied for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman that marked the history of dance in Europe of the two-wares, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to interpret Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "we don't try to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The title of his dances reminded me of Flamenco.
Thus, "the doll dance" reminded me of a popular Cuban dance and "the serpent dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as her,” she says.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his performances, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
“Matilde turns Tórtola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and the guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the rape of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, “who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered dives.”
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of that woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, such as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s those women who have an enormous influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work,” says Bayón.
The show will start at 20:30 am at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Three Year
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married poet" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
Thus, the “Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón” comes to its end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition “Juan Ramón Jiménez: This People of Light” which was inaugurated in May last and which, after traveling through the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and well illustrates the disappointment of American cinema, and all of America, facing the impressive idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
It was hard to get an Oscar.
It has not been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I’ve lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better thanks to its existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the homeland died during a dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are scared, the American appreciation has fallen very low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, human beings have only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defendant of the lost and defeated causes, as the foundation for the drug fight created in honor of his eldest who died after a overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had hard to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration walked Hollywood without paying attention to neither nationality nor passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He placed us the high bar," observed George Clooney, who is the only one today trying to break the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
This is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though the opportunities did not miss him to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a bifteck in my refrigerator?", he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud to see meeting his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
“In all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as that of the devote husband, the loving father, the careful grandfather and the philanthropist,” he says.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympics
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could be achieved in 2016.
I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I’ve ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors occurred during the race, they would be subject to an eliminatory note.
Let’s look at it in detail and from the beginning.
The mistakes begin with the removal of the puzzles, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better that they give you everything (including the electronic chip for races).
And well not
They made you go there only to take the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long line of waiting) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the shirt (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
In which world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small-size t-shirts with less fabric and thus cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you need to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you need to leave your back bag at the entrance.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions began and we had not left our backpack at the entrance yet, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
Furthermore, the rain accompanied more than 40 minutes of waiting during which rebellions and attacks took place in the barak.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote a perfect race example, this’t come to my mind.
So I think we will always be able to dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receiver (virtual)
At the MIT's Conference on Emerging Technologies Microsoft was presented a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shift to move in the company's campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Through a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this “receptor” can know how many people there are in the place, who they are – including remembering what positions they occupy – and listen and hear the keywords of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she’s here to visit someone and she says she’ll answer her in a few minutes.
This is all without a blue screen.
and impressive.
But, of course, it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we discussed a change in strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery as Microsoft, version after version, has not ceased to add features and “extra” to Windows.
Strategy change is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have fairly emphasized that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It takes the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your grandmother.
that is true.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system but more and more attention to the Internet browser.
The computer is only enabled to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing the windows.
To whom serves the half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less hard, less busy, less complex.
Currently, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search.
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone is more and more like a computer.
But since the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carried one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Father' and is part of the clothes of the Association of Muscular Gay.
And if we begin to list all of his appearances, we could also quote that cousual moustachu that raised weights in an ambulant circus.
It’s not just a simple male body shirt of cotton, molding and handless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels is distinguished among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport as it takes the name, according to the legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' distinguishes itself from others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex coupe, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (just recognizable) that the most famous body shirts have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweat-shirts, retro boxers, cardigans in cachemire, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of the underwear.
It’s a bad thing to wear them just as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn’t worry about me.”
Her enormous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Sister Cruz takes very seriously their new fashion activity.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the brand Mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera Dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s fascinates us and we inspire ourselves a lot for our collections.
I love walking around the city and watching women to see how they’re dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and painter, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but in the end everything goes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very young I liked the clothes; I would like to go to my grandmother to look in my aunt’s closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the entertainment park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear the clothes it is at that moment that you really put yourself in the character's skin.
After all, everything is connected.
You had not long 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn’t make me worried.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was small and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
Do you think you’re going to be a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, in addition, I want to become a young mother; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is to give a lot of happiness to my son and raise him with a lot of love.
Let’s go to the cinema, you’re waiting for the different films you’ve made last year to come out.
It’s true, I’m looking forward to coming out.
I who am a woman out of the theater, I’m very impatient and worried, I’d like to have everything now but of course it’s not possible.
I'm looking forward to the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo'.
To see what you will think about it...
A few days ago you started on the gate with Naomi Campbell, right?
Don’t say that!
I didn’t go to the gate to make the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her for a long time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association for the support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auctions to collect money for the NGO of Naomi.
People that Naomi is a person with a gentle heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
And that good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to flee for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pear, I would have done it anyway.
It is important to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of alcohol on the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in drunken state, or if it does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced in June last year and now appears in the State Minister’s report in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
His goal is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The State Minister responsible for road safety but also the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Foundation Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in drunken state, take the car back.
Alcoholock would avoid this because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol level in the hole and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver doesn’t breathe before; or when the driver’s alcohol level is higher than the authorized.
It costs more than €1,000 and is the driver's charge.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the infringements during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure applies only to administrative penalties for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary paths but, however, the reform by criminal paths requires an organic law reform.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and operating vehicles already possess an experimental one.
Exactly tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in school buses this system as it has been done in France.
Mexico without “peep-toes”
At 17:40, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias travelled landed in the presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico.
The sun was ahead of sunset but its rays still compelled to put the hand as a visitor to be able to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
“Oh, very well, then we can’t go to the airport to get guests at this time here... Are you here or then...?”
“No, no, I’m a Spanish, but I’ve lived here thinking for two years.
Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
They are several to wait in the hangar of the airport near the red carpet and at a military line composed of 27 Navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when to her, with the hair to the wind, is dressed very overly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; they had told her that a storm threatened.
They make a short stop with the photographers before going to the room where the official cortège awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious prize in fashion
There is no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is no more extraordinary and good live drawer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be awarded a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian out winner of the first edition, watched her models in the Mango showroom at Haussmann Boulevard 54 in Paris and she was almost excited about it.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe which has just been inaugurated with 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first store is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, chairman of the jury of the competition, made us meet in a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With as a nearby table that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of her brother's recent death, Nati put herself a Mango clothes and a few parures of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arms on it, arms down with her son Luis - a beautiful man of almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a galant man, and the Rotchil Baron ended the evening without a veston because they had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself in the store with a pants and a shirt – of her own collection – and who for dinner transformed herself by wearing a long sexy and black dress, was excited when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet repetitions room and remembering the good old time, she caught one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'great fold'.
Inés Sastre didn’t stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us before on her cell phone the photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure to see Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man moving on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his clothes, his towels and having asked in advance, that there is no smell in his room.
The stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh, that’s life here.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and freeness of everyday life.
And to coronate the whole, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookmakers on September 30.
The morning awakening almost hurts us when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse when we think of the agitated rhythm that today’s life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer of back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to fight daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
No one more, no one less, no one more.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or ‘spa’ treatments, Susannah Marriott brings in the pages of a book a whole ‘menu’ of methods tailored to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 ways to relax' and will come to the bookmakers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run into your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit in the sofa, disconnect from its mind and focus on reading.
Talking while Sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time that happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a benign sleep alteration that is called sleepy.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
There are more than one people who talk during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (one time in life, for example, associated with an episode of severe fever), or more periodically (to every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (pipe in bed) or sleepambulism, but that’s not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, situations of stress or exaggeration.
This is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, murmures or, on the contrary, with screams, crying, long speeches...
In the case where sleepy disease becomes very common, it would be reasonable to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We said that this is a beneficial alteration, therefore there is no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleeps appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
useful advice
Do not wake him up.
This is unnecessary because he is unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t have the temptation to ask him to get information.
You won’t get anything, because while sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you won’t know what he is dreaming about, then pay attention to how you will interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even by joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern and finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his terrain after a long period of discretion.
Without making a big match, the Yellow and Black created the largest number of occasions and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Visitor Kauffmann who broke the lucarna on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and turn-to-turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came to catch the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, a block was made in the middle of the field and just left the Riahi remnant at the top of the attack.
The start of the second half time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to regain a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53th').
But the Illhousiens shooter will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the clothes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his colleagues in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie won’t be able to take advantage of it and won’t put big problems to an illusive Eleven who just dropped a little behind to “compacte” his defense, except in the last seconds of game where, after a big crawling, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a tour through Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of strength by fishermen who severely disturbed the access to several Britain and Normandy ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finister, to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive mind" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals."
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the “crisis committee” created by British fishermen to obtain measures against the gas price flows, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter in average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president will “debat with them on solutions that can be imagined to help their regain competitiveness and to secure the employment and wage conditions of the sailors.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted scargot operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing closures of 10 km.
Quiberon's entertainment port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Ile were not stopped.
A filter barrier has been launched on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Marines have already demonstrated their determination on Monday by burning, from the morning, tires and palettes in front of fuel deposits in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic facade and the Manche, such as the Sands of Olonne, in Venice, where the chalutiers remained at quai, or in Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” must decide on Tuesday on the consequences to be given to the movement and its participation in the interview planned to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue,” because “fishermen will not leave anything” and “do not want to move to Paris,” Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, said.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently paying about 50 cents per liter but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is achieved only with a gas less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman is the great.
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from a cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have greeted the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian airline table on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that plan on the world economy.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer,ins its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the airline delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot of the Chinese market especially for its aircraft range ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to transfer more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have overturned, intends to transfer more than 15% of its assets to reimburse the $85 billion that has been advanced, according to the Sunday Financial Times edition.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its life insurance to the international and its retirement activity in the United States, the newspaper cites sources close to the dossier.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine possible cessions, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings reassurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity.
No final decision has been made on these cessations, the FT continues.
AIG has to quickly make liquidities to reimburse the loan of $85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
History of Morning Meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a ever seen loss approaching the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the re-establishment of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology dominant Nasdaq index gave 199,61 points to 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points), to 1,106,55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the House of Representatives’ unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan that had to allow a little stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 for, the representatives rejected the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he demanded.
Approximately two in three Republicans rejected their plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market relied on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in a few days will not come “too late.”
"If the project is actually dead ... then the relay will be quickly transferred to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the feeling of emergency, “every day passing brings the fall of a financial institution” in the United States, said Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, pushing to emergency interventions in the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing “not only an American crisis, but a global crisis,” added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3,632%, against 3,827% Friday evening, and the 30-year-old to 4,161%, against 4,357% the previous day.
Obama wins the points of the first TV duel
The first Friday debate between the two White House candidates followed another to ask who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took him.
Without surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point advance (49 percent against McCain’s 44 percent), considers that it was the Democrat who pulled out of the game.
Among the indecised voters, who are those who count, Obama has won for 39 percent of the respondents, while 25 percent of them give victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected from his counterpart, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventh-year-old McCain has been constantly highlighting his indisputable foreign policy experience, while emphasizing the "naivity" of his opponent on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,” he said.
A angle of attack martely since yesterday in the Republican television ads.
Obama said he represents the future.
Without dismantling, it turned out concise and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, yes,” a democratic spot accused the Republican of not taking all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the “American of the Street.”
“Thro the eighty-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a blowing rain.
He didn’t even pronounce the words “medium class” or “workers.”” The financial gap clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
“The next week could be a decisive turn,” influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current breakdown "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still succeed in reducing the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite the Wall Street subjects, the Illinois senator also that achieving an possible energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energies was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain has planned to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Pride, the two candidates have escaped the questions concerning the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, “You noticed there was an election, you?”
Youth and opponents demonstrated on Sunday night in the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday after the closing of voting offices in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: “the dictator, resignation.”
Some admit not even to have voted: "What good, since they will do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good figure to foreign observers with the aim of regaining language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa prohibition for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered as own by observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
“We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the demolition,” said Iouri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
“This is a cosmetic change,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in us it is the executive power.
If opposition members enter the parliament, they will be appointed, not elected.
But their entrance to parliament can mean space for television, meetings in the regions and proposals of laws.”
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because “the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily debtful to Russia, enters a crisis, and we don’t reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, will not recognize the validity of the election.
She emphasizes that the numbers of participation appear too high, and that the generalization of voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“You have noticed that there was an election, you ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the voting offices.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition in parliament, those that are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls back on the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate for their success.
Review: The Blood Is Back Safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dre Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, since Hema-Quebec has become one of the world’s safest and most effective blood suppliers.
And most importantly, it has regained the public’s confidence that had been seriously shocked by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross transfusion service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the grounds of the public, the Government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public investigation, headed by judge Horace Krever, an investigation aimed at making light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and formulating recommendations so that such a disaster should not repeat itself.
While Judge Krever was delayed to submit his report, some provinces then set up a committee aiming to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the General Assembly has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began its activities, only 38% of people still believed in the blood system in Quebec.
The situation was discouraging.
With efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground over the years that followed, we have recovered the public’s confidence,” she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, 94% of the Quebec population had now confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dre Decary, however, keeps in mind that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has applied the principle of precaution.
At that time, many cases of the human form of Crazy Cow Disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were seen in Europe since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gellineau reports, according to which when it is unknown and that a serious disease can arise from it, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, measures of exclusion are established.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood was rejected to people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it was demonstrated without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us that the principle of precaution that we applied was meaningful.”
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (TANs) that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and that they cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health,” said the head of the head of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will arise in the system.
Not later than last year appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues the Dre Decary before emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supply.
“The needs are rising because the population is aging.
Since anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or plaque recharge.
The ageing population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which accounts for only 3 percent of Quebec people who are eligible for blood donation.”
Any healthy person aged 18 years and older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is affected, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3% we succeed inining an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The weaknesses are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
As today’s life is so narrow, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving his blood,” Francis Decary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye balls and skin which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Quebec which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The ombilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousand samples of cord blood and we are scheduled to take over a thousand each year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year,” says the Dre Decary, which describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't have access to it," because Hema-Quebec has no means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Half-Final
The Impact of Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the eliminatory series of the USL’s first division, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series in total goals, at Stade Saputo.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on the one and the other side, the midfield David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other networks of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first match of the series go back, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Whitecaps in Vancouver in the semi-final.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a deficit of 3-1 in the return match to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still accessed the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
The victorious goal of Kovalev
The Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian at the barrier shots against the Panthers of Florida, yesterday night, at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two aid, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian government warned.
I need another match to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
I think he liked the end of the match.
He had a great ovation.”
Charest to the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude to launch elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest visited yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected on the occasion of today’s partial elections.
"Return the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the major lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin with images.
In the circle, on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric barracks, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
as well as in the electoral period.
In a press point, the prime minister also refused to exclude that he would trigger elections this autumn, although he noted that his schedule was very loaded.
The “Nord Plan” is the fourth panel of a “vision” that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes an agreement on workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, only explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give deadline, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The north contains “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond,” according to Mr. Charest’s listing.
This “territory twice as big as France”, “it’s at home, it’s in Quebec.
Not only is it at us, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was seeking a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he emphasized: the row to gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, 70 percent of the Quebec territory, comprises a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press point.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
“There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity comes, I repeat that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, “with climate change, we need to re-think our Northern vision,” he said, speaking of the northwestern passage, which will open throughout the year due to the flooding of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that the project would benefit them, especially the youth.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekinist member of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
A interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision."
The development of the North would also be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be “concerted, ordered and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who have preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the party’s head.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to repart the Beauharnois Central in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who made the peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made the Bay James, our party knew how to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
In a press point, he invoked another reference, conservative that, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric barrier project, Mr. Charest emphasized that its launch was planned for 2012.
“It remains between us there, but I am planning to be there,” he told his militants, raising foodful applause at their homes.
In fact, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of triggering a vote this autumn, which the law allows him.
He emphasizes that his schedule is, however, filled with, in particular, a mission of the Federation Council in China and a summit Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including the “constitutional aspirations” which have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular demands the recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have a veto right on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the major lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pekin leader, Pauline Marois, came out of the North Quebec Development Policy that Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done it, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (Scrutin that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government’s adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Posts Tagged: a dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (irony) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
Thus throwing the opprobe on that woman who has led an unstoppable struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration tells as much about the surroundings of the prime minister as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its citizen imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take any attention to the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that are accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child-soldat to crumble in unhuman conditions.
The only one who goes to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
The UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, appeal for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It’s the same government that closes the eyes on torture: it doesn’t matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, forever after so many years of exactions.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy”, the word that Harper continues to blame and that sounds so dull in his mouth.
Here is the time when no more morality exists: a Canadian citizen can be misleading, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned according to the good will of a so far minority government leader (what will it be after October 14...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that promotes virtue, law and order: they don’t see that this government has renounced what made our country’s reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has initiated a six-million diffamation prosecution against three authors and a small free edition house in order to launch a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of prosecution in defamation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dare to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defence and fight, with very inequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets of the mining.
The tactic, in these inequal struggles, is often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a friendly settlement that will shake the opposition in addition to scary anyone who will dare to look again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by exchange of ideas and not by mattress.
Therefore, it was sufficient for the mining to open its books, its dossiers and to set up a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have made the light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects from the rear hand the petitions and support letters to the authors of Black Canada.
Per Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a “public” debate while neglecting the opinions of the same audience?
In the world of the vice president, it seems that this word refers only to the fat-paid lawyers and not to the whole Canadians; here’s a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even critics have the right to speech.
What doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – Barrick Gold is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it first and foremost because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not within the framework of what many perceive as a prosecution-base (after the “public debate”, Barrick Gold has just filed a statement to the place of the authors of Black Canada intimating them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s persecution is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to the citation of credible sources and to the debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the foundation of intellectual work itself.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
He has a right of replication.
The academic environment, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s immeasurable prosecution clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put in place measures to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation: Democrats and Republicans Agreed
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has shocked Wall Street for months is still to be confirmed by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by the elected parties of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the public funds engaged, new provisions to contain the number of houses charged for failure to pay, and a right to look at the wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiation table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We’ve made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the markets,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done in a way to protect the real economy and the ordinary Americans from the current crisis in Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last hours due to fear of the effect that a new failure would cause on the mood of investors.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
Later associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election showed themselves rather favorable to the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction that we are forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that aimed at allowing owners to preserve their home and that on the salary of the leaders of the companies rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of the U.S. television.
Asked on another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes."
“The great lines I’ve read show that this is something we’ll all have to digest and with which we’ll be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with the money of taxpayers the doubtful, risky assets and invoidable debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the collapse of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and resulting in a liquidity frozen and banking and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected who had captured the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since the Democrats have accepted that some “toxic” assets of difficulties are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, it was also added a provision that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could set up new taxes aimed at helping it to recover its position.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first section of 250 billion, which can be added to another 100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion dollars is expected to be confirmed by another congressional vote.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will get shares in rescued companies that will be worth dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to sell when the torture will pass.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the lawsuit procedures relating to housing attached to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits to the remuneration and departure compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote today, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Votes have continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's financial committee, told his voters.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to benefit taxpayers.”
Animator of a small group in Congress called "the caucus of the skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel prizes, have written to us to say: Congress is asked not to rush and carefully examine the way to take,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we had again the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2,9 billion U.S.) in the risky real estate loans crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
“It’s not the money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In exchange, a voting right is recovered in the bank and influence.
It’s exactly something that savings and households appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Manche, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank underway by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take on its account all current loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75,5 billion US) real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Icon Engaged
His beauty in the blue eyes was long his advantage card, no one will say his weakness.
Was he released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and not.
His wickedness, his sensitivity, and a talent that flows from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that infants the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, following a lung cancer in his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more cautious in his game, more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children beautiful.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without unmeasurated ego, ultimate quality mark.
For in him a whole country was drawn up by the self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in the fight, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television, and soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the shadows of this secret star, discreet, engaged, allergic to the shadows of the show-business, whose mystery will not be completely broken.
A fair man in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance has brought the filmmakers to a hole this weekend, as his major roles on the black screen of memories are shocked.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation flows through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a burning roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Close to us (1990), we talk about his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have passed into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminalizing, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean, recovered after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), an Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
A gorgeous billard player and revenge in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take the character on his return in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who awarded him in 1987 his only Oscar for nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
And again he.
The times go through his path.
Young people know it mostly through the cultissime Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen Brothers.
With the last role of the Iranian mafia in Sam Mendes’s Road to Perdition in 2003, the circle was closed.
Contrary to several film legends that left the job early enough, Newman will remain in the seat for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, “as a living challenge to “underplaying” judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long all cooked in the bowl.
He played, however, less often the early young people than the marginals: neurosed, alcoholic, wicked or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected derives and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known facets of his true pudique sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traced a final female portrait of melancholia.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of pudding and sadness.
Among the rain of tribute on Newman yesterday, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generousity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestant of Hollywood derivatives.
We’ve seen a lot of his binette throne on pots of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, though gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to its Foundation for Childhood in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And it is a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizenship in top and above.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company make in their facturing factory?
In the near future, on 8 October, hearing relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his complices will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, permanently and regularly, resulting in significant damages. Other heads of accusations have been arrested against them, such as for example, false and use of false.
According to the prosecutor, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, approximately 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand to the Fiatal Baloldal movement’s cash and on the other hand, to the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing charges, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus, the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the accusation, a large part of the bills were false.
For the latter, they purchased bills at the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the cages at Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to be listed on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to his report, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for a invoice, on the model of which they were making the other invoices they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his complice András Őri, who, according to our information, was primarily concerned with the drafting of the documents necessary to obtain the subsidies.
During a "recovery circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager’s statements, it would have been impossible that so many people occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, which will later be named Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, broke with errors of form and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned a hundred and thirty customers.
The invoicers with overwhelming imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor the name of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told the site hvg.hu that when the prosecutor called him and showed him the invoices, he knew, immediately, that it was false documents.
“The name of our company and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the cache.”
He added: “Beyond the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people had housed there, did not coincide, as this establishment has only eleven rooms, which have not so much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentioned meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time.”
Zelled invoicers have also not been informed about the Budapest travel agencies, being part of their choice, but organizing only travel abroad. So, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the agency's accounting practices.
Furthermore, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, while benefits relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp at the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, as the company’s benefits do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%.
The prosecutor’s investigation reveals that the “emitters” also made errors by mentioning as a service the road transport of goods, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, given its profile was the investment council.
Furthermore, it is also for faults of forms, such as inappropriate types of invoices and false hidden, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have turned out to be false.
Just as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sport stage of Kunfehértó, which both deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to take a meal at their home.
Contracts made deliberately
Another category of invoicers is that of those who were quite aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, established a invoice to the order of the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the accusation act, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Likewise, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement took place, either, as the invoices issued were later cancelled, but this, the agencies well avoided mentioning it in their accounting.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly linked to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the CEO of the company Delta Trió Kft., engaged in fuel and motor vehicles trade, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices regarding the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the survey, these equipment would have been purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have provided documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he took their countervalue.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian Masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies did not work, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still served these societies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of societies, he established invoices to their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generation associations.
Kubatov gave agencies, 15 bills in total, issued by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecutor believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to set up fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont’s subsidy application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generation and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a subsidy application to the Socialist Party’s public utility organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for a double amount of 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this being known, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out at the office of Arpad Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, a part of the accused will report the method of making the invoices, as she had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the least details, he has not yet done it.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or then, eventually, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably harassed, as the demands for his placement in a supervised residence, on the basis of a relief of his detention conditions, continually fall into the ears of a surd.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The psychology of the surcharge: why do we spend more money?
When auction sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in Neurology and Economics at the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don’t want to be distant during this type of competition, such as an eBay auction, and that’s why they even prefer to pay a too high price.
These researches have tried to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played the lottery, while the other group participated in a lottery auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), the researchers analyzed the active brain fields of the experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could earn money, but during the auction sale of which an essential element is the surcharge of a third, the set located under the brain throne, called striatum, moved intensely during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That’s why, according to the researchers, the rise of prices is explained by the flight to the violent striatum reaction.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
During these, three groups overleashed face to a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they thus performed their placement.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win out of the game, then they would receive $15 extra, as a reward.
While the third group received him these $15 before the auctions, but the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed in one on victory, while in the other on failure.
Thus proofing the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the team of players "contra failure" were ready for higher bets than those performed by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by starting, now, on a third explanation." - found Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated to be a hundred miles of the hepatitis virus carriers in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is due to the fact that often the patients do not know that they are the virus carriers.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
Inflammation of the liver and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and caused diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no C vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a bad general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then a visible yellowness develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the seals become clearer and the urine takes a darker color.
Worldwide, every year, one million people die from the most severe form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients don’t know how to get infected with the virus, because the pathogenic gene destroys the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who suffered a blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million people in the world have chronic type C hepatitis.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor immediately after observing symptoms of unknown origin.
The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of a cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organisms representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to attract attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment analyzing at what level faith in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this least bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and so many Athesians were subjected to electrochocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also possible to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the pain regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologists participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument that emits bricks and diffuses the electrochocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to sustainably look at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers who originated this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked some kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, carried on its calming effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time, they received 20 electrochocks in four parts successively, while watching either the religious or the more general theme painting.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe,” like someone who was “careful” and they “calmed, and peace invaded them.”
In view of the religious thematic painting, they 12% less pain than when they watched Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, among the atheists, provided that the appropriate picture is found.
“We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, the English bishop, greeted the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases it actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these great results, it remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows the believers a Madone painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its 10th anniversary, Google claims that it can be found in the bottom of people’s pocket as the sky above their heads. It knows where they have spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their centres of interest.
It is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to the skeptics setting a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they don't just see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google’s founders can meet their initial goal that sounded as follows: “Let’s gather in a system all the information of the world!”
According to Google’s chief interrogated, after ten years of global chambolling work, they’re still just at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What job would be best for me?". However, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, until the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that starts the search and the pages then visited by the interested people are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can check what they have sought, on what they have clicked. Through this, long-term, Recommendations, the program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit us products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks what is my job? asks users, who are worried seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can raise fear, and it is not the regret, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or eventually the rebellion against power that can raise a counterreaction among the internet users.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the searched terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of the Internet users.
The most remarkable example in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing a identification.
Internet users concerned about the rights of the person were able to push a breath of relief in May last year, when Google, hand up below with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right to court in front of the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google will still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the secret request of the FBI, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the child protection law, voted several years earlier. but in the end, it fails to get the search lists of private users, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is fooled by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its “wild” gathering enthusiasts, activists and enthusiast computer users that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the “binding corporation”, in contrast to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as the world invader because of Windows, and that, even if both struggle for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for ID code, does not ask for money for its applications. Documentary code and program package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cool effect, facing the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between the rights of the person and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword in recent years, draws just behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 does not concern anything but collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we serve communication channels put to our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young man, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo galleries they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can get to know many examples, such as the girlfriend who easily understand at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the company who dismissed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term privacy is completely to reconsider today.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today’s young people.
Whoever wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent the Google monopoly, can do it (by starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, deliberately leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not less. Google's online services, passing through text processing to image processing, to information reading can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and which do not gather our best profile, which has existed so far.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is more valuable than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten advertising agencies’ turnover, while services introduced at an increasing rate cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer software makers.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company’s top management has rejected, in its entirety, the employees’ protests, after it has doubled the price of the corporate maternal and after the company has considered too expensive the daily multiple restoration, taken at any time. All this seems dérisoire in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquired before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is on, is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world to new points. While some think that the scan and archiving project of books and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the company will soon meet in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its Health system, because in this, we can build a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-ton orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached scaryly nothing but through Google’s data.
Two minors helped get the traces of the double homicide in Oz
"The police called two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to reasoned suspicions, they helped to make the traces of the crime disappear," the spokesman for the Borsod department police said.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information of the MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder can lead to a detention that can last up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder in Ózd, a 23-year-old man from the corner, was placed in provisional detention on Sunday.
The heads of accusations held against him are multiple murder, committed with premeditation and by interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old man owes a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and that’s why he attracted his creditors, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old girl of that man.
According to the information of the MTI, the young man predicted his crime. the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes on the site of the crime is the proof of it.
Police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech Economic Daily E15, the proposal of the Poles represents the highest offer ever made for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the Prague Stock Exchange Director, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new least good owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by market experts.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, about 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 percent shares, followed by the 14.7 percent bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the European press point of view
In their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis, which is worsening day by day, the leading European press newspapers already mention a "second 11 September".
“The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the U.S. president,” the Romanian newspaper La Repubblica accuses, “the president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a proposal of law, improvised to the way, aimed at bringing help to a desperate situation...”
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the messenger in Washington.
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, it is the faults of the political leadership there that has brought the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world will pay the strong price.
Bush's plan was far from being perfect, however, according to Congress voting, a real danger threat, that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the empty, just at the time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
We can’t ignore the threat longer, says Geneva’s Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still tend a rescue bowl to their financial institutions, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse such as the dominos, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long run, we need that the states of the European Union make few cases of their national egoism, and that they centralize control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than €100 billion - the Vienna newspaper, Der Standard, who adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put the hand in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
Until now, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, part by part, the old continent.
“Rescueers” should not immediately earn a hundred billion euros, but it would be reasonable if they noticed in what case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers’ money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the bourdon
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, unless it is the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC, which takes place in Japan, bullshit bees gave the strategic start-up idea to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini-car robot, a bio-inspired self-robot control system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with bees’ qualities, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding any obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own, oval-shaped space, which in reality resembles a lot to our secure protective coat - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
Bee’s face eye plays a primary role, as it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the facet eye functions, engineers addressed the idea of the laser telometer.
This identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the board microprocessor, which turns it into an immediate avoidance maneuver.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the bees’ movements, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it with a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently existing, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
"If not so, the mini-car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must respond instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for now the collision is considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a glance.
Unlike the bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonal, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotative movement, acceleration and slowing as maneuver available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and with a larger energy concentrate, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primary, not the processing of data, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism needs to process only a few input signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data from previous maneuver. In this way, it uses only a few dozen continuous memory-bits.
There is no need for memory of a capacity of gigabytes or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology that serves instant avoidance. According to Nissan’s estimates, this system will make its entry into serial-made cars over the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
They gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying the dubious loans from the banks, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during new debates lasting until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
“We’ve made a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which it’s only left to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, here it is not a question of the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the rotating of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20h, local time of Washington (i.e. Monday at 2h, according to local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the draft law that meets the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of the year 2008.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also greeted the news of the agreement.
“We are satisfied with the progress we have made this night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
In addition, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent in a single time, for the purchase of securities related to doubtful credits.
From now on, the maximum half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the law was adopted by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will serve the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase doubtful debts from the banks, while the use of the additional 100 billion dollars will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
According to the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to purchase doubtful claims, securities related to doubtful mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The ministry’s competent persons said that the purchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the opportunity to the companies concerned, to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to predictable damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools in such a way as to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast purchase of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
“We will take the necessary measures, to be ready for the law as soon as it is signed,” he added.
On the contrary, the bank leaders who are in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their starting compensation, simply called the out-of-Atlantic golden parachute, to be bound by the government.
The wage threshold is mentioned only in very specific cases.In addition, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of the threshold means that if the Treasury Secretariat acquires as part of an auction, they will take a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president leaves in retirement.
Immediately after the purchase of the doubtful debts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The threshold applies only to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal limits will be in force regarding the appointments of general directors - commented the chairman of the committee responsible for the financial benefits of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state seeks a right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall back on their legs.
The draft law states that within the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress which will decide on how the losses will be refunded to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts regarding this plan.
It’s not for this reason that American citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect the dollars from taxpayers – said California’s Republican deputy Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same who press the action, as those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will we need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are good chances that around January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa exemption agreement enters into force. This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, “now, everything depends only on the time when the out-of-Atlantic electronic input and control systems will be put into service.”
Every time, it has attracted attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today, in Washington.
He will meet with the Foreign Minister, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisors of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, provided their support for the government's $700 billion rescue plan.
After marathon talks that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday morning, that they have concluded principles on the plan of rescue of banks.
This funding plan, which aims to degel the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama once again managed to get a little ahead. McCain's advance, obtained with the nomination of Sarah Palin as a collister just after the Republican convention, broke down.
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope to see Congress quickly vote the 700 billion rescue plan.
He emphasized that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sector and the stability of the entire economy," he said in a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss describing McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but not doing anything is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator said that in the proposal, it is mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the threshold of the department compensation of the high leaders, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
Press Release of the German Language Territory
The right camp is intact, it’s only in the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious – that’s how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, speaks.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the Red and Black.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the CSU’s dramatic defeat in his article entitled “The Bavarian revolution devotes its fathers.”
According to this recognized politologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its functions.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now they are the same modern citizens who turn their back.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely just ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devoring its parents", established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
However, the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of north and east Germans in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes along with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the party the voters have become more conscious, more critical and more enthusiastic.
It is also surprising that over the past few weeks, it is just the groups of classical citizens that have gone rather away from the CSU, such as independent, craftsmen, bachelor’s holders and graduates.
In these groups, the support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? with whom? the party presidents stand on the reserve facing coalition issues," the Austrian conservative daily deals with the situation of confusing internal policy that established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to interfere with its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ shows itself open to negotiations. the Greens still don’t want to reach an agreement on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything turns around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders have hardly allowed to see their cards.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is actually possible – that’s what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as Deputy Chancellor, remains open by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replication of this combination is out of question.
Molterer responded cautiously to the proposals of the Red.
As he has already said, a collaboration will be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entering the coalition is momentanly a completely open question. These points must absolutely be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the Chairman of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the Red and Black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka says it is necessary to break the wicked circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equality of Opportunities, hosted by France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union, began in Paris.
In his message exposed to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokeswoman of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, member of the Fidesz European People's Party, attracted attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects the most Rom children and therefore, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, Járóka warned that in addition to the differences found during the hiring, the Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their poor qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a graduate degree."
In addition, Járóka insisted on the fact that education as an elementary right of the human being plays a key role when other fundamental rights must be applied.
Investing in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economies of the EU member countries.
According to the European Parliament, it is necessary to bring awareness of these reports within a broadest possible circle, also between the Roms and the non-Roms.
Indeed, the earlier a Rom child begins school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
“Because of their nationality in the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed with their right to quality education, and be protected from poor quality and sectarian education,” Lívia Járóka said.
According to the MP, a goal-oriented and action-oriented EU cooperation is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the school degradation process. For this, compliance with existing and preparing anti-discrimination directives is of primary importance.
“We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; we need to give the possibilities provided by democracy to the Roma children, so that they can participate as full-right citizens in the future of Europe,” Járóka said.
In the name of the “European Year for Equal Opportunities” for all, the objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since the last year’s Berlin Summit, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken for equal Opportunities and for the fight against discrimination, aimed at the European and Member States level.
CSU: the grace for a transition period
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the falling duo Huber-Beckstein will be made.
Despite this regrettable election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been delayed.
The party president, Erwin Hube and regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place.The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
Members of this highly criticized couple have, in any case, made the feeling that they didn’t hold on their seat.
Through this, they used to calm the angry members of the fraction and base, who one day after the “Bayern tsunami” demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career – the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsh against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength left.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the “unique sovereign” of Bavaria giving 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
But the conservatives still count strongly in this southern region, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tattoon discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right values, about an possible coalition of the government of Munich.
A strange foot of fate was that with the help of the list of the Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered legislation, whose measurement against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now CSU leaders put all their energy on to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far was throwing the hips into the backgrounds, will also receive an active role. The former regional government leader and former CSU president has designated September 28 as the hottest day in his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, which has played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of terrain will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
This is relatively because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the social-democratic crisis will continue.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
None of the opposition members have accessed the parliament of Belarus after Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illicitities committed during voting.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has gone very well of opposition for many decades, before yesterday’s elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his presidency for the fourth time in doubtful elections, on the traces of the 2006 constitutional amendment, would “permit” this time the presence of a few opposition members in parliament.
In this way, the ODS has renounced its initially planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order qualified as an anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take a credit due to the decrease in Russian natural gas imports, increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the Beltransgaz company, owner of gas pipelines across the country, has passed to the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the campaign assessment, emphasized positive changes rather than failures, such as the prohibition of appearing for one-third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior calming.
However, the OSCE's statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were dismissed.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a noticeable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have returned freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the southern Ossetia and Abazia separated from Georgia.
“We’ve made two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU,” Alexander Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains so, although "the power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to make even one opponent enter."
The opposition does not plan protest actions in view of the results; it rather tries to send its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
“Naturally, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to print our opponent newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us stalls in the wheels in terms of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circles of the elderly,” said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported retirees no longer really considers it appropriate.
“Because of the country’s debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, ‘revealing the silence of a cemetery’, is no more than a matter of time,” Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers qualified the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words, but in acts."
Brunetta: “From today, breakfast before work.”
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, we had no turning doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the little wicked, against whom it points and then will drink coffee at the bar during the working hours.
The anti-fading novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
“The rotating doors are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” the minister said.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
“It’s reformism,” Brunetta also emphasizes.
The installation in all the premises of the Presidency of the Council is complemented with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, “the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures: "This is a process shared by the employees, and we had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
According to the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Rome, “in three months, the absence of diseases of public employees has decreased by 50%, or more than 60 million workers in a year.”
And he added that it is essential to make the public administration more efficient.
Italian, "which wages dynamics have doubled over the past 8-10 years compared to the private sector, and moreover inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees gathered together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
“As long as the Minister of the Public Service today raises the data concerning the decrease in the absence on the workplace due to illness – writes the consumer association – the people of the “active fainants” continue to increase.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees have gathered together to declare war on the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allocations in case of disability due to service; the prolongation of the hours of the home stay of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: “Critial Prevention”
Every day, there are 2,500 work accidents in Italy, three deaths and 27 persons remaining permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were about 1,200.
The figures show the severity of the phenomenon which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice more deaths than murders.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Occupational Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The annoying data disclosed by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events in recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention on the workplace,” said Republic President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses "he sincere appreciation for the continued efforts of the association in favour of the prevention on the workplace, the protection of accidental workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of the public"
“Naturally indigned, everyone has hit the finger to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, raise the clam of the media and the participation of the public opinion, even if the daily reality presents dramatic, even repeated cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness from young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to keep the attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On his side, Chamber President Gianfranco Fini emphasized how “this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social urgency, which insults the consciousness of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to end it quickly.”
The work accident data appears to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘reduction trend’ to actually turn into a minor attention, because it’s exactly when the attention is relaxed, that tragedy happens.
“We believe that in general, we don’t do enough to counter the accident phenomenon and the contrast can be done through multiple actions.”
“In our opinion,” Mercandelli stressed, “more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a greater intervention on the training of workers, and this, from the school.”
He added: “We need to make a further effort with regard to the communication and awareness of the public.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the employers is needed to face a phenomenon that represents a social urgency.”
“Mercandelli then denounced the progressive deterioration of the conditions of preservation of the compensation for the victims of labour” and the “assistance deviation to which the system is oriented in recent years.”
“The goal, therefore, is to return to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – in such a way that the fate of the one who has an accident, should not depend on the spontaneity or the extension of the legislator.”
Mp3 player pointed by the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement released in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unpredictable and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“This scientific report – let’s read in the note – shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, risks a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am worried that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“According to scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this domain information public.
In addition, we need to review existing control systems, given the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies.”
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intense use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other stakeholders, what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concerns are increasing regarding hearing damage that could arise from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to correctly limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and the duration of noise exposure.
The U.S. Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibel) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limit for the maximum consented noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interests 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno gave an order to withdraw the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we get the amounts.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Capital Rome", which took place this morning, in the new seat, behind the Thermes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so that in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official temple" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno will be presented.
“The committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it,” Germanno emphasizes, “that it will have to propose the ideas of development of Rome that will be used by the political decision makers, who remain the committee and the municipal council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, as this experiment must have a precise time-long duration.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan out of the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Capital Rome.”
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: “All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward and further towards a deeper perspective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future.”
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that “this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost one euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and make the best intelligences that express the Capital participate.
For Alemanno, in fact, “there is a need for a strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, “.
A future that will “not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further” not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also “in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.”
Obama is the first anti-American president.
A famous American politician who wants to become an independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.”
The attacks on Obama are rising as the date of the election is approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really crazy: he believes he will win the highest position in a nation that has two governors and five black senators!
In reality, these are attacks that don’t say much; these are obviously racial attacks, and don’t answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president?
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the southern entrances of the United States, wrote an article: Once in the voting cabin, we know well to whom the American patriot will vote.
This is where an aspect of American mentality emerges kept secret until the end.
“Tell what you want, we’ll see ourselves put the cross, either on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we’ll leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasoning, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What were the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89 percent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was returned to her home by footsteps.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make their bags.
Nevertheless, Iraq was, mostly, the weakness point of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
The U.S. economic breakdown is felt even among journalists: in the press, it’s time for suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this “assassination” of the paper newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interrogated by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Nowadays, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attached, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like before.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if we wish that traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, does not decline significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalist are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong path.
Local, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
Journalists have no difficulty seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the “assassin” of the paper newspaper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to put themselves on technology hoping that it will “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest gap in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level, this percentage is down to 23%.
For some, this is related to “work safety”.
Managers who think they lose their job within 3 years are 47% at national level.
As for journalists, it is 30%.
The “safe work” at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
Managers almost always receive large wages, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, passed a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It is the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:Tribunal Rome, Danilo Copola remains in Grotaferrata.
The chairman of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a housing in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banqueroute as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation instructions.
During his trial, last week, he had obtained the home release transformed into mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the city to a house in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the PM has not granted) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the House of Representatives’ vote, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a large number of Americans were, and is still, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the U.S. economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday who confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its former soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, just, that made itself feel despotically with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is only an example of changes, of great changes that the current economic earthquake predicts or already leaves running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not be only here.
In the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to have accelerated the phenomena covered for a while, so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary resurrection, of the double category of the sovereign state, compared to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved in a large scale, the balances of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for the one who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only national here.
Political internationalization really seems out of play or has little to say: the obvious proof is provided to us by the European Union which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone awaits interventions, plans of rescue and rescue, new rules, and above all a condition of credit: when one passes through a difficult period, there are only the states who possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to restore things into place.
They also have the necessary resources and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever be able to have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis remains in perfect harmony with the ever major importance that the latest economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite connected to this element: the territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, as we were convinced that we were now entering the kingdom of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized by a single blow, that our future will, on the contrary, have to settle its accounts more and more with the pretty little material things such as water, harvests, oil.
Things that can be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circular space, to a territory.
Thus, whoever is sovereign, possesses more cards than whoever is not, that is, whoever has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
Now I get to the second novelty which, however, predicts a fraction.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy, and thus Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the consciousness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leaderships, economic species that have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadows.
And, in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discretion, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the whole class of directors in a growing number of countries in the West.
Thus increases even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now to their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly stranger to the opinions of the majority.
In short, The Demand for Leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral “revolutions” or, in the changes in collective mood of these recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Great Britain, to the U.S. congressist rebellion against Bush (and it could well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, some would say, have increasingly more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and thus to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis potentially strengthens, increases and agitates in an immeasurable manner.
In view of all this, talking about a current “mass rebellion” on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said well, keeping the eyes open, it is not without reason.
The superhole to walk on the walls.
Conquer the laws of gravity through a super stick and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded in it.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms hanged on a vertical wall.
The American Science magazine published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nano tubes.
“The layer principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a spaghetti pile,” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology at Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves from the geckos legs, covered with microscopic hair that enable the animal to be a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “sweets easily from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
It may be that yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that carbon nano tubes are heat and electric current conductors.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
There are no superheroes for now.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a adhesive made of microfibres like hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adhesive.
Remedies: Never with fruit juices.
Be careful with potato, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, consumed mainly in the summer because they are disalterant and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medications, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing according to the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, reminds the risks of fruit juices whether they are, in a box or fresh, if associated with the intake of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of potato juice, orange and apples is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
The pepper juice has already been strongly criticized because it has been responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arithmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs, to toxic levels.
It is the Italian Medicine Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take medications such as, for example, Diazépam or Methadon.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of the active ingredients inhibited by pepper and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally, immediately to the various national and international agencies of medicines that will need to change the information notes of the medicines.
It is always advisable to read the illustrative papers of the drugs you take, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to clearly address the doctor or pharmacist," the expert said.
Nobel Prize in Economics by Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is also a famous New York Times publisher.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks during the days of Enron’s bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would be more determinant than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that dissolved many polemics, and which was blamed to the economist for years, but which now has turned out to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a bit shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the Enron collapse or Worldcom, disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a very aggressive disclosure, critical to the excess of the Bush administration’s liberalism.
Open Office is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to touch more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After one year of work, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is presented to the general public with various innovations: from the welcome screen, and the reviewed and less sharp interface, to more important, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Open Office has paid special attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite and it is in fact possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
As interesting, some functions specific to certain modules, such as one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that connect the typical graph of Adobe format to the elements of a calculation sheet or a text maker.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, different users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the elaboration of texts, since each collaborator is attributed a color of comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should release the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in the houses, it’s just in the business, that Open Office suite tries the big challenge, already able to rely on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Without counting the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could otherwise open to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the competitive PowerPoint presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; finally, Drwa is the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected number.
Kohl also, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
A new case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the t-shirt of the best climbers.
It is the newspaper’s website that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, they also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's tests are part of those carried out in recent weeks, by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to forced to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus rafting the coat of the best climbers.
The New York Times asks if Italy is racist.
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with discretion.
This is what the New York Times has dedicated a long article discussing the topic of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both those where more integration and more work is recorded, but also "a strongest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the most important support for the Northern League."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature desired by the League to block immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestines, is quoted as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The trend highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros for a room.
Student Rental Markets Not in Crisis
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the syndicate of renters, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the extent that it has excluded the entire categories of youth, the right to study due to the very high overall costs that families of origin have to support – explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities, the high demand by students has so deformed the market that a process of generalized increase has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, unlimited rental, sub-rental.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through tax revision are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single bed, we go from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a bed is about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a single bed.
In Rome, in the areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we demand about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas near the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you get away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar areas.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a simple one you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you need to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, a subsequent anomaly is recorded: the lease requested to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities remove historic halls.
Historic cinemas are closed in favour of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the screenwriter Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the province cities.
The process of the marginalization of the cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multisals, and the death of consumption of the mono rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems unavoidable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, it’s often historical and memory-filled places, “it’s as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of way and so many emotions” observes the scenery of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and which tells the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional-type cinemas have closed, and the halls of the major cities have mostly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Emilia Romaine is in the top with 82 lost mono movies, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of the multiplex, as it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-sales films: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romania.
"The Italian exploitation has evolved in an irrational way," observes Paolo Protti, chairman of the ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still be guaranteed the survival of those already existing, because when a room is closed in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplex.
Not to mention the missing deliberation of the credit to the merchants: the state's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Let’s note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried of these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signature of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinema mono halls of historic and peripheral centers.
Among the planned regulations, there are tax facility measures for managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the area with limited traffic, and will have special rates for parking spaces and in certain parking spaces.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that in order to counter the super power of the multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Bagheria Super Cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the lightning that convinced me to make "New Paradiso Cinema" which I thought about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have so much shared emotions, I turn on the other side to not see the panels dirty by dust.
Relationships between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“Gioia Tauro’s mayor was willing to uniformize the mayor’s choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
Heavy charges are launched by the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of the Calabria, against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little son lawyer, homonymous with the boss, already convicted of association of mafia-like criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"A confrontation to legal and moral norms, and above all to the good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to Maître Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - writes the judges - to enter officially within the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and guidance of the public administration."
The chairman of the Calabria Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "colusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "There are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure of the indrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests this morning follow the arrests of last July, following which the police announced that they decapited the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused then Deputy Interior Minister, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating everything for a political matter, but given the arrest request signed this morning, judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM writes, is emerging “the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more famous group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones are launching.
This is an unmeasurable landscape that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, floods, here are the new renewable sources on which colossals like Chevron have put their eyes, and now try to put their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in concomitance with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put off, but now the ecologists and the new oil rise give a great growth to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by sea hole operating systems.
This would be twice as much as the number produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there will be the currents and the mores.
Colosses at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a real revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more candidates among these companies ever dedicated to traditional energy put on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” said a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossal to the Economic Daily Wall Street Journal, “and it is evaluating the possibilities of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question, concerning the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project of exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that just in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the way of the energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested until today, although their details are unknown, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still at its beginnings, with the fact that marine energy does not dissolve the fears about the environmental impact.
Currently, systems like those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and don’t seem to create big problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
“And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a blade system connected to each other.
The wave push, which makes the mole move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure makes a turbine turn which in turn feeds a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
Currently, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and a part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and a parking space using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water during the floods makes the turbines turn, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to extract energy.
After the waves, the waves.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time, the potential of floods.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the storm is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it’s just on the energy of the floods that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and predicts investments up to $35 million in 2009.
