The triumph of the populist right in Austria, together form 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current large coalition and an expressive strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People’s Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shattered.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the postwar and especially for the popular ones who called for these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had in terms of preference over the SPO a considerable advantage.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, deputy chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be reached on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party’s presidency.
Such evolution would obviously facilitate the path to the constant and more approximate starting point of election results, that is, the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
Given that the reinforcement of both populist right-wing parties – the liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes – and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated in 1999 when the populists negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered from the BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
By this evolution clearly bets Haider who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
Also the Green Party has managed to get to parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent threshold and therefore does not belong to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it fails to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally harvesting scarabies, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the minister in New York, after his meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be solved then yes, then it would come to this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from charges and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Your problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, that he appealed to the highest instances.
After that, he can request the exemption of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the Supreme Court and then the indulgence would be possible," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by obtaining a "competent legal support" to the convicted, the Indian minister said.
He also said that such support has already been obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest inining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would take care of the matter.
“I’ve gotten a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbitrage a battle on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, which depicts Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and alongside it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seafloor hides up to today a little known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms to date that in themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the firm earth.
Coastal countries have begun today to fight vehemently for new territories under the sea.
According to the Treaty of the United Nations, these take advantage of the rights agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is fundamentally the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
Simply put, by continental border is understood the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the boundary of the sea coast, and often the boundary of two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request that the country concerned submits to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer borders of the continental border shall be submitted with scientific and technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
This is the result of years of preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal aid commission.
The Commission has so far handled five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine domination.
However, New Zealand also achieved it - the surface of the seafloor that the commission awarded it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, which is almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars for their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seafloor will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other countries are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so until ten years from the moment they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
There where the continental edge ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
No nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
“The seafloor, however, is no gold mine,” says Mikulka emphasizing, adding, “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in the year 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as other few states, states called "the pioneering investor".
It has the faculty to explode in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is accidental, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
“A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete sites that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this kind of concrecy.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to the legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the German special forces command was on the scene.
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for the help of Germany—the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Therefore, on the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation as well as the experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen on Monday night, German forces were not needed because hijackers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted the help of Germany to use it as support on the spot.
“Fortunately that time did not come,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
On September 19, in southern Egypt, assailants had kidnapped a group of travellers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the abduction in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported from side to side in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the saved people arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus from the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed a large $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones dropped dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes to 206 the government’s package to save the financial markets.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With a dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to make a vote though the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the poll, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that were the concerns of investors that the state bailout package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
In order to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers report increased number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even in the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened climate, the desire of the Germans to travel remains the same as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK market research institute, reservations for the autumn months had already risen in number.
So the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened dollar, travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices are rising, in this case travel costs are “better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip.”
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive deals, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose – although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, dropped.
The first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless spa, the beer in one-litre jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut in a campaign store.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t have much in common.
She is a blonde, television moderator and wears a traditional Bavarian suit on her own.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re barely in the campaign store, the photographers have already rushed toward us and filled their memory cards with the photos – it’s very delightful especially because I’m at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you make friends.
The traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
In fact, as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany, my sense of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seem to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant – everything is absolutely normal.
Only my foreheads get rare looks next to a banana stand on chocolate.
A Munich calls my attention on my front shirt that she had dressed in the wrong way: “The left side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widow.”
Oh God, now I turn my back to the left.
“It’s okay,” he said laughing.
Others don’t care about many of the subtle methods to flirt and wear hats where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their naked ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionist is called Bob, he is from England and is also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
To him it seems “gorgeous”, which he pronounces with a very long “or”.
He tells me after putting his glass of a liter of beer that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think that’s a rubbish cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
Others are not very lucky and can’t consume so much alcohol.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, healthcare groups run around the place of the party and have to worry about poor drunkards.
The toilets appear more and more in groups - suddenly there are always four people bringing the covered ponds from one campsite store to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You don’t see who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is in the streets.
“They are the ones who “cannot be able anymore,” a healthcare provider answered my question and disappeared in tumult.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Much before Turkey intended to be a member of the European Union, the European powers wanted to penetrate the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides say.
The building is placed on the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, resembling a typical German town.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the box office was overcome, there is no doubt what the greatness of the company was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a “latecomer” in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what today is Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British domination and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has gone down and remained on the margins of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves – at least symbolically – to highlight Turkey’s willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of cooperation.
The Turkish governmentins excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed to a bowl and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP leaders, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a shaking journey, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – a new city, thought to rule a new secular state, away from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus.
That has raised some suspicion in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure – built ad hoc – in a developing suburb, surrounded by mid-built shopping centers and “power bakeries” where middle-class managers in business costume – men and women – meet early in the morning to get along/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I’m sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off in its relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both things.
“But surely at some point,” I ask him, “could Turkey be forced to choose?”
“Turkey,” he replies, “does not want to crush this election.”
Next, he highlights a point that almost everyone I’ve spoken to so far has recited to me almost from memory: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East would largely be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered “the sick man of Europe.”
Therefore, there is no doubt in what continent this fascinating country should claim.
Lives to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (skeleton, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It’s supposed to be for those under 21, but at the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 – we just refused to give up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, either madrigal or Messiaen, whether or not accompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and all was due to that man’s inspiration and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He would say, “The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in music.
You just have to sing!”
His rod was always absolutely clear and precise, though never impositive, nor too blooming.
Whatever the musical scare, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by any, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known war horses around the world."
We will miss it a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) stated that "in 1946 he resumed studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research fellowship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff’s author in Beyond Nab End, but it’s not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, season during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
“I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino “Flamenco and life” because his photographs in white and black, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second strike for Honda's supermarket
Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz in November.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolume presents an even wider interior space.
All this is accompanied by refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow more fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics can be noted.
However, before we analyze the new model, we have to comment that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz has been the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
More than a million units of the Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda hopes that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to slow down sales in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% by 2010.
To this quota, Honda is counting on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size – 4.37 meters in length – of which the Japanese company expects to sell 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of the Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society is made in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows at all levels.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the luggage compartment – which features a double-backed system – rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the first-generation luggage compartment.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the version with the 1.4 engine, as the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements – in addition to exterior elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass – is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row present an opening angle of 80 degrees, against the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of the Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will have two 1.2- and 1.4-litre gasoline propellers.
Both engines incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 litre mechanical obtains a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm.
This propulsor - which previously Jazz achieved 78 horsepower - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, now passes to have 100.
This 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The Bee Car That Avoids Collisions
To advance in the development of accidents prevention technologies, Nissan has inspired, this time, nature, in particular, bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as its basis the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technical Center at Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious Tokyo University in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Chief Public Relations Officer for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that resembles Nissan’s Safety Shield.
But the most important are the composite eyes of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles at a distance of up to two meters within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a straight or larger angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to spin its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It doesn’t require storing information or intuitive logic of previous operations, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we’re not talking about memory gigs, not even megas.”
This is the first step to developing new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Beware before you mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid for injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a sweet and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
The “Hotel of the Bad Credits” or the “Hotel of the Bad Credits”.
The hectic aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
Of course, it has useful information, but not very detailed.
It’s more a site for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is finished?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because of buying a better house we do not talk about...
Morgan Stanley sells stake in Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its listing on the stock exchange.
A week after discovering a provisional deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the accounting value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible bonds, which will ensure a 10% yield and a $31.25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a price per unit of measurement of $29, or 28% above its current rate.
Morgan Stanley shares lost 6.79 percent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said Juan Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have allowed him to diversify his activities but he makes it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the bigger names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, explained in Tokyo, "we thought the participation would have been made up only of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley bonds 7% below its accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 more or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that MUFG’s capital will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined, however, to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have eased his balance sheet considerably since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock exchange quotation drop by half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other only “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refunding the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, at the example of his colleagues and friends, it is the third time that a draft for a new Constitution was put to the vote.
Mission fulfilled as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the suffrages.
According to these results, the "no" received 28%, 7% of the suffrages were null votes and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half the suffrage plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a part of a non-governmental organization had announced a widespread victory for the "yes", estimating it between 63 percent and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa also claimed on Sunday night the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed crushingly,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
So, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the “new socialism” defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies the increase of the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the “development planning” of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to currencies that send its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who will be able to do up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and would seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of the gratuity of health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty threshold.
It finally prevents the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. drug operations.
19 kidnapped people released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were abducted in the desert 10 days ago arrived safely in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good at their arrival at 15:30 a.m. on board a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they could not speak to the press.
“They are in good health” and “no ransom was paid” to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into power by 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an all-terrain safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then passed from one Zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
“An exchange of shots occurred, and they killed half of the hijackers, the others fled,” said this official who kept the anonymity.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the lightning unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also denied the payment of a bailout.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain on board of which were the hijackers, of whom it killed six, including the Chadian leader and detained two.
He also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately dismissed by this group.
Literature: The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites dying of hunger?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about searching in history, preserving with little money lots of private archives and preserving archaeological vestiges.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The government of the Netherlands nationalizes part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands – being the first in Europe – will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the U.S. market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros this financial and insurance institution that also has in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition minister.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the eurozone crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered as precedent.
According to the decision adopted on Sunday morning, the three states will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the bank’s ownership in their area.
The Bank will surely sell a portion of its business, including the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis stocks started a sharp drop last week and for the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, this bank is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s shares dropped 12 percent on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's management blamed the sharp fall in Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the US market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank’s new CEO.
The bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors had no need to worry, they would not lose their money.
Among the bank’s customers so far there has been no panic, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the Chicken
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when looking at medication purchase details, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of data from prescriptions in all cases binds it to the approval of the given person.
The same should be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we trust the chicken to the fox" - cites the Washington Post to Richard Dick, the designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation dependent on the customer’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Previously, they sent the client to medical check and signed the contract with him already knowing the outcome of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer’s identification number he easily obtains from the pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the patient’s illnesses and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-reducing pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even set a number of risks, so that the insurance company in addition to the administration barely has something to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk increasing factor for insurance companies while the first is not.
Special companies were established to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities have already forced them to do so, although they have not been fined for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and by combining them with drug consumption data obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it only applies to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill gives the authority the right to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite all, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
EU doubles trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutual trade partners, this issue in addition to other largely global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, primarily to address cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit started yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, turning president of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, president of the Commission, and Javier Solana, chief foreign policy representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, prime minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than 100 billion euros, their trade.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
Thus they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi only ranks ninth among the EU’s trading partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism – all its forms – and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also crushed, although both sides have great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate program, meaning that by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 percent.
India is also in agreement with this, just as next year’s climate conference should reach a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international book exhibition in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.

It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the print at the Room Struktur at the 5.0 Pavilion of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at 3,000 meters altitude, in the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson said: "The plane has been localized, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it's own of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance."
The officer said no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire was found dead in February.
The American Office for Transportation Safety (NTSB) has that a few hours after the detection of the remains, a squadron of investigators has been sent to identify the apparatus: it is owned by the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had conquered a place in history thanks to a long series of primaries.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world round in an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he had made the world round in a plane and without escalations.
Among his records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a copywriter.
Glk, the advertisement you don’t expect
A Suv out of schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and defined angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the all-terrain "compact" trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Proper to the content out of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the SUV Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls from the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that would dominate the central street of the milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the auto in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car is out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to recompose into a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers?
Who are the Italian Hooligans?
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sports events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed?They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the National Italian for years and that until now, to say the truth, had never created too many problems.
They have never met the rival fans.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, in fact) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been pulled out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match – all already with names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had gone to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition on access to sports events) at that time, none that had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had criminal records at stadiums, were denied their ticket and travel.
Now the interior ministry expects to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
A Daspo (interdiction of access to sporting events) international that prevents attending not only the Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans will not put any more foot in a stadium.
by luck !
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others may be added.
“We have to immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” the interior ministry said.
Therefore, "well-open eyes" especially in view of Wednesday's national party in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is, the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste's public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not unlawful to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
“I don’t do the sociologist – adds the Observatory’s No. 1 – the crimes are attributed to the countries in which the fact occurs.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take this into account for the future.
But let us also talk about the silbids to the hymn of Mameli: they are also not a crime, but if they allow, they are not educational.”
