NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and reducing CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on ground-based radars, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
no extra transport will be added and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that you would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's fans.

Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer because of mating between the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.

This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice varies depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Brinons are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).

When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.

Finally, there are many small cats (including loose house cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey animals such as insects, rodents, fleas, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of niche, a special task each cat has, that keeps it from competing with others.
Leos are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The Huns are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flock reacts much like wolves or dogs in flock, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete, can climb (but not well), swim, jump long and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a string of snorting, shouting words.
Ozelot preferred small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that lizards follow and find prey by smell, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly. Ozelot chase their prey by moving in with their surroundings and then jumping over their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population has to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously would have been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
over time, as the new population starts to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Then, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
we call this process "species formation", which simply means the formation of new species. species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen, which humans inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., exhale).

Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 teeth sharp as a knife and an extra set in the top of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, and its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.

Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seabird.
Another difference was that whereas the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.

If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a tax card is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
e it says something on the back of the document, it's not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".

So it's likely that the note was just attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government, the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.

For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the analogue film era.
still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from sensor sizes in digital cameras.
35 mm is actually, which may seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics and at the same time keeps a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).


Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to commoners.

The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was being properly lived out.

The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching the area.
UK laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unlimited submarine warfare.

Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.

To understand the Knights Templar, you have to understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The time period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.

Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that is hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motorized car necessarily leads to the development of roads.

car ownership increases road accidents, leading to new health technologies to heal injuries.
Romance contained a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.

It is known to have been an epicenter of luxury since about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.

Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterized by age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of several factors.

one of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children through failure, accident or wilful neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Some wild children have been deprived of their liberty by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases this child failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) that is nearly identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
t project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but placement goes a step further.

can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a kind of display, but so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stands are internalised in the software and aim to question, ask for and explain procedures which may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
children come into foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
no child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care and education, but they do it nonetheless.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is responsible for providing all the necessities that were not available in the home from which they were removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement""persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Especially, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation and removed from the pool of exact variations via selection".
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.

The easiest plant sources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are hard to digest unless they're cooked.

Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
lf you find yourself turning the clock off while you're sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known hydrolytic) before sleep, forcing one to get up and fill the water.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is the exact opposite of the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All humans have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that's stopping us from reaching this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibet buddhism is based on the teachings of buddha but was expanded by the love path mahayana and with a lot of techniques from indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple.It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in WWII, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in the systems, processes and cultures of the countries led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.

The use of freight ships is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
one of the most remarkable recent examples of this is the north atlantic campaign of world war ii. the americans tried to ship troops and supplies across the atlantic to help the uk.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.

As far as we know, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.


Though the carriageways were made of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day.
swallows were invented early to keep the tracks in place, but eventually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Then wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.In 1767, the first rails were used, made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transport was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
their ancestors Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
There are two-legged specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he had it read to his troops in New York. On August 10 a copy reached London.
The Dunlap Sheets, which still exist, are the oldest surviving version of the document.
ae paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language now.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are far too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.

both predators and bed bugs are nidicolores, meaning that they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Throughout the United States, there are some 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in the best interests of them or their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific investigations.

Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.

periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue for a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first proposals to suggest that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they either marked the DNA in the bag with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bag with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape and the flora and fauna.
examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, as well as studies of ecosystem information.
one example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in borneo.
where people leave small villages in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
on this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system that is based on private cars.
Decarbonised economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, now believes science.

In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Thanks to the fact that drivers are usually reasonably consistent, traffic is also reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help with the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the dayfly are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.

The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.

The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.



The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.

The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break down under little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.

Content theory is about finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
Theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
Theories explore what is in certain people that makes them do certain actions and what elements in their environment make them do or not do certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the need pyramid and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.

This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise are set for virtual teams as for conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
(Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports."Invisible Team" sets the standards for each member.
why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? one of the goals of translating organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to show up when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organisation.
As a result, the process in an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation and knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organisations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research field and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models with, which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves being able to make machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
like this has become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been incorporated into numerous home computers and computer game software applications.

The technology offers virtual excursions where students can view museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
sharing a virtual excursion is also a good way to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.

Casablanca, was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.

Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this gives access to either a selection of South Africa's parks or to all of South Africa's national parks.

Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 50 miles [80 km] from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
They include some of the last remaining vegetation of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/moss areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 chitals now live in the area.

Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes, each 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important group of natives who lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, which was once known as the "Great Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.

Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer there, and winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures are usually above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures seldom reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
